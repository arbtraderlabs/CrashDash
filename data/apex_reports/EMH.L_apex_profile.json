PURSUANT TO RULE 7 OF THE AIM RULES:\nN/A\nA BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR SETTLING THE APPLICANT'S SECURITIES:\nTo be traded on AIM, securities must be able to be transferred and settled through the CREST system, including CDIs and DIs, to be held in electronic rather than in paper form.\nThe Australian equivalent of this system is called CHESS. Ordinary Shares held through CHESS on the Australian registry may be transferred into DIs held through CREST on the UK depositary registry and vice versa.\nNotwithstanding the proposed re-domiciliation, the Ordinary Shares will remain listed and traded on the ASX, with trades settled electronically on the Australian registry through CHESS.\nA WEBSITE ADDRESS DETAILING THE RIGHTS ATTACHING TO THE APPLICANT'S SECURITIES:\nwww.europeanmet.com\nINFORMATION EQUIVALENT TO THAT REQUIRED FOR AN ADMISSION DOCUMENT WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY PUBLIC:\nPlease refer to the Notice of Annual General Meeting, posted to shareholders on 06 December 2023 and available on the Company's website (\nwww.europeanmet.com\n), for the following details:\n\u00b7\nBackground to migration of the Company to Australia (the \"Migration\")\n\u00b7\nProcess of Migration\n\u00b7\nAdvantages of the Migration\n\u00b7\nDisadvantages of the Migration\n\u00b7\nThe New Constitution\n\u00b7\nProportional Takeover Provisions\nInformation on admission and CREST settlement, the new constitution and some additional information are detailed below.\n1. Admission and CREST settlement\nUpon completion of the Migration, to reflect that the Ordinary Shares will have become shares in a Australian company rather than a British Virgin Island company:\n(a) the ISIN of the DIs in Ordinary Shares will change to AU000000EMH5; and\n(b) the SEDOL of the DIs in Ordinary Shares will change to BSC9SJ5.\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for 207,444,705 Ordinary Shares to be re-admitted to trading on AIM. It is expected that the re-admission will become effective and that dealings in the Ordinary Shares will re-commence on\n10 May 2024\n.\nThe last day of dealings in the Ordinary Shares before completion of the Migration is expected to be on\n9 May 2024\n. The last day for registration of transfers of the Ordinary Shares and DIs before completion of the Migration is expected to be on\n9 May 2024\n.\nThese dates may be deferred if there is any delay to the re-admission to AIM.\nOn the effective date of the Migration, all existing share certificates representing Ordinary Shares will not be cancelled and will continue to represent Ordinary Shares following the Migration; however, upon a transfer of Ordinary Shares represented by an existing share certificate, a new share certificate in the form adopted by the Company following the Migration will be issued to the transferee.\nAs a result of the Migration, the DIs over British Virgin Island shares that are currently traded on AIM in London will be DIs over Australian shares, which have a new ISIN and SEDOL. Under the AIM Rules, this requires a re-admission of the Company's shares to trading on AIM, albeit as a \"quoted applicant,\" as defined in Rule 2 of the AIM Rules and, accordingly, the re-admission will not require a full admission document, but rather a Schedule 1 to be submitted to AIM, no less than 20 business days prior to the date of re-admission. The Schedule 1 will be made available on the Company's website. It is not expected that this process will create any further interruption to the normal trading facilities of AIM afforded to Shareholders.\nFor shareholders who hold their existing Ordinary Shares in electronic form in a CREST account by way of the DIs established by the Company as at close of business on\n9 May 2024\n, they will be replaced by new DIs in the Ordinary Shares (reflecting that European Metals will have become an Australian company) which will be credited to their CREST accounts on\n10 May 2024\n.\nHowever, if a DI holder has a preference under the Migration to receive shares on the Company's Australian share register rather than receive the new Australian DIs, then the following process should be applied:\n\u00b7\nA DI holder should submit a CREST withdrawal instruction to convert on a 1:1 basis their BVI DI holding into a holding of CDIs on the Australian register, maintained by the Company's Australian registrar Computershare Investor Services Pty Limited. CDIs can be held on the Australian register through CHESS or in Issuer sponsored form;\n\u00b7\nthe BVI DIs shall then be withdrawn from CREST in the name of holder being registered with the CDIs, and if the CDIs are being delivered to a custody arrangement the Australian custodian shall be advised to accept their delivery; and\n\u00b7\nwhen the Migration is effected on the Australian CDI register, all CDIs will be automatically converted to shares.\nAlternatively, once the new Australian DIs are issued, a DI holder of the new Australian DIs, if they wish, can request to withdraw the new Australian DIs and convert them on a 1:1 basis into shares on the Australian share register.\nThe Company will apply for the DIs to be re-admitted to CREST with effect from the re-admission.\n2. New Constitution\nEuropean Metals will adopt a memorandum of association and new articles of association, referred to as a constitution in Australia (the \"New Articles\" or \"New Constitution\") (together the \"M&A\") upon completion of the Migration, in replacement of the existing articles of incorporation and by-laws (the \"Existing Articles\").\nThe New Articles seek to keep the constitution upon Migration generally similar to the constitution pre-Migration and generally only to incorporate those changes required or expected by Australian law, AIM market practice or where European Metals wants to introduce enhanced shareholder rights and protections. The key differences in the New Articles as compared to the Existing Articles are as follows:\n(a) a right of shareholders holding at least 5% of the share capital to require a resolution to be put to shareholders at a general meeting along with minimum notice requirements will be included in the New Constitution;\n(b) the New Constitution will incorporate rights given to European Metals to sell shares that constitute less than a marketable parcel of shares in a class a class of shares, subject to the terms of the New Constitution and the listing rules of ASX;\n(c) provisions allowing for preference shares to be issued by European Metals at the directors' discretion;\n(d) restrictions on the offers of shares involving monetary consideration under employee incentive schemes;\n(e) increasing the minimum number of directors from one to three and placing a cap on the number of directors that can be appointed at any given time to ten;\n(f) the New Constitution includes the Proportional Takeover Provisions under Australian Law; and\n(g) certain administrative provisions differ between the Existing Articles and the New Constitution such as the treatment of calls, closure of registers, prohibition on transferring shares to infants and occasions when voting via polls is required.\nThe New Articles will be made available on the Company's website:\nwww.europeanmet.com\n3.

This means that the Company may recover the call amount from any one or more of the joint holders but must not obtain more than the amount of the call from those joint holders.\nNotice of call\n3.8 Subject to the terms on which the shares are on issue, at least 10 Business Days' notice (or such longer period required by the Listing Rules) must be given to the shareholder of the date on which the amount of the call or the instalment of the call must be paid.\n3.9 Subject to the terms on which the shares are on issue and the Listing Rules, the notice must state:\n(a) the amount of the call or, as the case may be, the amount of each instalment;\n(b) the date (or dates) for payment;\n(c) the time (or times) for payment;\n(d) the place (or places) for payment;\n(e) that interest may be payable if payment is not made on or before the date (or dates) for payment; and\n(f) that a lien will arise if the amount of the call or the instalment is not paid in accordance with the notice.\n3.10 A call is not invalid by reason of any unintentional error or omission in giving notice or by non-receipt of notice.\nRevocation, postponement, or extension of calls\n3.11 Subject to the terms on which the shares are on issue and the Listing Rules, the directors may, by notice, revoke, postpone or extend the time for payment of the call.\nInterest on unpaid calls\n3.12 A shareholder must pay to the Company any called amount by the time, in the manner and at the place specified in the notice of the call.\n3.13 If an amount called is not paid on or before any date specified in the notice for payment, the holder must pay interest on the amount unpaid, at the rate and in the manner specified in clause\n3.54\n, from the date specified in the notice of the call for payment until and including the date of actual payment.\n3.14 The directors may waive the right to require the payment of interest.\nSuspension of privileges\n3.15 Until a call (together with any interest and expenses that are payable) has been paid, the holder is not entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution or to be present and vote at any meeting (other than as proxy for another shareholder) either personally or by attorney, proxy or by Representative. The shareholder may not be counted in a quorum or exercise any other privilege as a shareholder.\nRecovery of called amounts\n3.16 In any proceeding to recover a call, or an amount payable due to the failure to pay a call or late payment of a call, proof that:\n(a) the name of the person against whom proceedings are issued is entered in the register as a holder of the shares the subject of the unpaid call;\n(b) the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the minute book of the Company; and\n(c) notice of the call was given to the holder of the shares the subject of the unpaid call,\nwill be conclusive evidence of the obligation of the shareholder to pay the call and it is not necessary to prove the appointment of the directors who made the call or any other matter.\n3.17 Any proceeding brought by the Company in accordance with clause\n3.16\nwill be without prejudice to the right of the Company to forfeit the share the subject of the unpaid call.\n3.18 In clause\n3.16\n, a proceeding to recover a call or an amount includes a proceeding against a person whom the Company alleges a set-off or counterclaim.\nPayment of calls in advance\n3.19 The directors may accept from a shareholder in advance of any call, the whole or part of any amount unpaid on any share.\n3.20 The directors may authorise payment by the Company of interest (in an amount determined by the directors) upon the whole or any part of any sum so accepted under clause\n3.19\nfrom the date of payment until the date on which the sum paid is payable under a call.\n3.21 Any sum accepted by the Company in advance of a call is:\n(a) to be treated as a loan to the Company, not as share capital of the Company, until the date on which the sum is payable under a call or instalment; and\n(b) not to be taken into account in determining an entitlement to vote or the amount of any dividend in respect of any share.\n3.22 The directors may repay any sum accepted in advance of a call.\nNotice regarding forfeiture\n3.23 If any shareholder does not pay the amount of any call or instalment in respect of any share when it is due and in the manner and at the place specified for payment, the directors may give notice to the shareholder:\n(a) requiring payment of:\n(i) the unpaid call or instalment;\n(ii) any costs and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of the non-payment of the call or instalment; and\n(iii) interest that has accrued at the rate and in the manner specified in clause\n3.54\non the amount of the unpaid call or instalment;\n(b) demanding payment of those amounts within 10 Business Days after the date of the notice;\n(c) stating the manner in which payment is to be made; and\n(d) stating that the share and any dividend in respect of it not yet paid are liable to be forfeited if payment of the amount demanded is not made in full within 10 Business Days after the date of the notice.\nForfeiture\n3.24 If payment of the amount demanded is not made in full in accordance with a notice given under clause\n3.23\n, the directors may by resolution forfeit any share the subject of the notice.\n3.25 A forfeiture of any share under clauses\n3.24\nto\n3.35\nincludes all dividends, interest and other amounts payable by the Company on the forfeited share and not actually paid before the forfeiture.\n3.26 If any share is forfeited, notice of forfeiture will be given to the holder of that share and the date and details of the forfeiture will be recorded in the register. Failure to do so will not invalidate the forfeiture.\n3.27 If the forfeited shares are entered on the CHESS Subregister, the Company may take steps to move the share to a subregister administered by the Company. The forfeiture is effective at the time the share is entered in that subregister.\n3.28 Any forfeited share is the property of the Company and, subject to the Listing Rules, the directors may sell, re-issue or otherwise dispose of any forfeited share on terms and in such manner as determined by the directors.\n3.29 At any time before any forfeited share is sold or otherwise disposed of, the directors may cancel the forfeiture on terms determined by it.\n3.30 On forfeiture of any share, the holder of that share ceases to be a shareholder and ceases to have any right as a shareholder in respect of that forfeited share (including in respect of any dividend), but remains liable to pay the Company:\n(a) all amounts payable by the former shareholder to the Company at the date of forfeiture;\n(b) any and all costs or expenses incurred by the Company in respect of the forfeiture; and\n(c) interest at a rate on those amounts at the rate and in the manner specified in clause\n3.54\n, calculated from the date of forfeiture until payment of amounts and accrued interest in full.\n3.31 The liability of a former shareholder continues until:\n(a) the former shareholder pays all those amounts and accrued interest in full; or\n(b) the Company receives and applies, as the net proceeds from the sale or other disposal of the forfeited share, an amount which is equal to or greater than all those amounts and accrued interest.\n3.32 The Company may receive the net proceeds from the sale, reissue or other disposal of any forfeited share and execute an instrument of transfer in respect of the forfeited share. The Company must apply the net proceeds of any sale, reissue, or other disposal of any forfeited share in or towards satisfaction of:\n(a) firstly, costs and expenses paid or payable in connection with the enforcement of the forfeiture and the sale, reissue, or other disposal of that share; and\n(b) secondly, all amounts due but unpaid and accrued interest on all those amounts.\n3.33 The Company must pay the balance (if any) of the net proceeds of sale, reissue or other disposal to the person whose forfeited share has been sold, reissued, or otherwise disposed of.\n3.34 A statutory declaration signed by a director or secretary of the Company stating that the person making the declaration is a director or secretary of the Company, and specifying that particular shares in the Company have been forfeited, or sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, on a particular date, is conclusive evidence of the facts in the statutory declaration as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the shares and of the right of the Company to forfeit, sell, reissue or otherwise dispose of the shares.\n3.35 The purchaser of any forfeited share is entitled to assume that the proceeds of the sale or other disposal have been applied in accordance with this constitution and is not responsible for the application of the purchase money by the Company.\nCancellation of forfeited shares\n3.36 Subject to the Corporations Act and the Listing Rules, the Company may cancel any forfeited share.\n3.37 Liability for the amount called but unpaid in respect of the cancelled share may not be released or waived without the approval of the holders of ordinary shares given in accordance with the Listing Rules.\nSurrender of shares\n3.38 The Company may accept a surrender of a share by way of compromise of a claim.\n3.39 The directors may accept the surrender of any share which may be forfeited. If the directors accept the surrender, that share will be treated as having been forfeited and may be sold, re-issued, or otherwise disposed of in the same manner as a forfeited share.\nLien on shares\n3.40 The Company has a first and paramount lien:\n(a) on each partly paid share in respect of any call (including any instalment) due and payable but unpaid;\n(b) on each share in respect of any payment which the Company is required by law to pay (and has paid) in respect of the share for which the Company is indemnified under clause\n3.51\n; and\n(c) on each share acquired under an employee incentive scheme for any money payable to the Company in relation to the share, including any loan under an employee incentive scheme.\n3.41 In each case, the lien extends to all dividends from time to time payable in respect of the shares, the proceeds of sale, reissue or other disposal of the shares, and to reasonable interest (at the rate and in the manner specified in clause\n3.54\n) and reasonable expenses incurred because the amount is not paid.\n3.42 The Company may do all things necessary or appropriate for it to do to protect any lien or other right to which it may be entitled under any law or this constitution.\n3.43 By notice, the directors may discharge or waive, in whole or in part, any lien or declare any share to be wholly or partly exempt from a lien, but otherwise no act or omission is to be taken as discharging, waiving, or otherwise granting an exemption from any lien.\n3.44 If any share is subject to a lien and the Company registers the transfer of any share subject to a lien without giving notice of the lien to the transferee of the share, the lien is treated as waived as against the transferee.\nEnforcement of lien\n3.45 The directors may sell or otherwise dispose of any share the subject of a lien, if:\n(a) a sum in respect of which the lien exists is due and payable but is unpaid;\n(b) the Company has provided notice to the holder:\n(i) setting out the amount due but unpaid;\n(ii) demanding payment of that amount; and\n(iii) stating that the share is liable to be sold or otherwise disposed of if payment of that amount is not made within 10 Business Days after the date of the notice; and\n(c) the amount specified in the notice is not paid in full in accordance with the notice.\n3.46 The terms on which and manner by which any share may be sold or otherwise disposed of are to be determined by the directors.\n3.47 Interest accrues at the rate and in the manner specified in clause\n3.54\non:\n(a) the amount due but unpaid; and\n(b) costs and expenses paid in connection with the enforcement of the lien and the sale or other disposal of the shares.\n3.48 The Company may receive the net proceeds of the sale or other disposal of any share and execute an instrument of transfer in respect of the share. The Company must apply the net proceeds of the sale or disposal of any share in or towards satisfaction of:\n(a) firstly, costs and expenses paid or payable in connection with the enforcement of the lien and the sale or other disposal of that share; and\n(b) secondly, all amounts due but unpaid and accrued interest on all those amounts.\n3.49 The Company must pay any balance of the net proceeds of sale or other disposal to the person whose share has been sold or otherwise disposed of.\n3.50 The purchaser of any share the subject of a lien is entitled to assume that the proceeds of sale or other disposal have been applied in accordance with this constitution and is not responsible for the application of the purchase money by the Company.\nShareholder's indemnity for payment required by law\n3.51 If the law of any jurisdiction imposes or purports to impose any immediate, future, or possible liability on the Company, or empowers or purports to empower any person to require the Company to make any payment, on account of a shareholder or referable to a share held by that shareholder (whether alone or jointly) or a dividend or other amount payable in respect of a share held by that shareholder, the Company:\n(a) is fully indemnified by that shareholder from that liability;\n(b) may recover as a debt due from the shareholder the amount of that liability together with interest at the rate and in the manner specified in clause\n3.54\n, from the date of payment by the Company to the date of repayment by the shareholder; and\n(c) subject to clauses\n4.10\nto\n4.11\n, may refuse to register a transfer of any share by that shareholder until the debt has been paid to the Company.\n3.52 Nothing in this constitution in any way prejudices or affects any right or remedy which the Company has (including any right of set off) and, as between the Company and the shareholder, any such right or remedy is enforceable by the Company.\nContinuing liability\n3.53 If the net proceeds from the sale or other disposal of a share under this clause\n3\nare less than the sum of:\n(a) the amount due but unpaid in respect of that share;\n(b) the costs and expenses paid or payable in connection with the enforcement of the lien and the sale, reissue, or other disposal; and\n(c) interest on those amounts,\n(together the\nShortfall\n) the person whose share has been sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of continues to be liable and must pay to the Company an amount equal to the Shortfall together with interest at the rate and in the manner specified in clause\n3.54\n.\nInterest payable\n3.54 For the purposes of this clause\n3\n:\n(a) the rate of interest payable to the Company is:\n(i) if the directors have fixed a rate, that rate; or\n(ii) in any other case, 10% per annum; and\n(b) such interest accrues daily and may be capitalised monthly or at such other intervals as the directors think fit.\n4 Transfer of Shares\nParticipation in computerised or electronic systems\n4.1 The directors may do anything they consider necessary or desirable and that is permitted under the Corporations Act and the Listing Rules to facilitate the Company's participation in any computerised or electronic system established or recognised by the Corporations Act or the Listing Rules for the purposes of facilitating dealings in shares.\nForm of transfer\n4.2 Subject to this constitution and to any restrictions attached to the share, a shareholder may transfer all or any of the shareholder's shares by:\n(a) a Proper ASTC Transfer; or\n(b) an instrument of transfer in any usual or common form or in any other form that the directors approve.\n4.3 If an instrument of transfer under clause\n4.2(b)\nis used to transfer a share and the transferor or transferee is a clearing house or its nominee(s), the instrument of transfer may be executed by hand or by machine imprinted signature or by such other manner of execution as the directors may approve from time to time.\n4.4 A transfer referred to in clause\n4.2(b)\nmust:\n(a) be executed by or on behalf of both the transferor and the transferee (the directors may resolve, either generally or in any particular case, to accept for registration an instrument of transfer that has been executed using a machine imprinted signature);\n(b) if required by law to be stamped, be duly stamped; and\n(c) be delivered to the registered address of the Company or the share registry of the Company for registration (or such other place the directors decide) together with the certificate (if any) for the shares to be transferred and, subject to the Listing Rules, any other evidence the directors (or the Company's securities registry) may require to prove the title of the transferor to the shares and the transferor's right to transfer the shares.\n4.5 Except as provided by any applicable ASX Settlement Operating Rules, the transferor remains the holder of the shares until a Proper ASTC Transfer has been effected or the name of the transferee is entered in the register as the holder of those shares.\n4.6 In the case of a Market Transfer, the Company must comply with the obligations imposed on it by the Listing Rules and the ASX Settlement Operating Rules and any applicable legislation in connection with any transfer of shares.\nRegistration procedure\n4.7 Subject to clause\n4.4\nand clauses\n4.10\nto\n4.12\n, upon receipt of a transfer of shares that complies with clauses\n4.2\nto\n4.6\n, the Company must register the nominated transferee as the holder of the relevant shares.\n4.8 The Company must not charge a fee for registering a transfer of shares unless the fee is permitted by the Listing Rules.\n4.9 On registration of a transfer of shares, the Company must cancel the old certificate (if any) and any duplicate certificate.\nRefusal to register\n4.10 The directors may, in their absolute discretion, refuse to register any transfer of shares or request ASX Settlement to apply a holding lock to prevent a transfer of all or any of them:\n(a) where the transfer is not in registrable form;\n(b) where registration of the transfer may breach a law of Australia, including where a law relating to stamp duty prohibits the Company from registering it;\n(c) where the Company has a lien on the securities the subject of the transfer;\n(d) the transfer is paper-based and registration of the transfer will result in the creation of less than a marketable parcel;\n(e) if the transfer is not permitted under this constitution;\n(f) if the transfer is not permitted under the terms of an employee share plan;\n(g) if the Company is served with a court order that restricts the holder's capacity to transfer the shares; or\n(h) in any circumstances permitted or required by the Listing Rules or terms of issue of the shares.\n4.11 If the directors request the application of a holding lock to prevent a transfer of shares or refuse to register a transfer of a share, the directors must give written notice to the holder of the share and the broker lodging the transfer, if any, of the refusal to transfer in accordance with the Listing Rules. Failure to give such notice will not invalidate any act or decision of the directors not to register the transfer.\nClosure of register\n4.12 Subject to the Corporations Act, the Listing Rules and the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, the register may be closed during any time, and for any periods, the directors think fit.\nInstruments of transfer retained\n4.13 All instruments of transfer that are registered will be retained by the Company for such period as the directors may determine.\n4.14 Any instrument of transfer which the directors decline to register will, except in the case of fraud, or alleged fraud, upon demand in writing be returned to the party who delivered it.\nNo transfer to an infant\n4.15 A transfer of any shares may not knowingly be made to an infant or to a person of unsound mind or under other legal disability.\nCorrection of share register\n4.16 If a person is registered as the holder of any share contrary to the provisions of this constitution the directors may remove the person's name as the holder of the shares and other information relating to the person and reinstate the name of the previous holder of the shares and the information relating to that previous holder.\n5 Transmission of Shares\nTransmission of shares on death\n5.1 On the death of a shareholder, the Company will recognise only:\n(a) where the shareholder was a sole holder, the personal representative of the deceased holder;

In that case:\n(a) the shareholder is taken to have irrevocably appointed the Company as their agent to do anything in clause\n6.5\n; and\n(b) if the holding was created after the adoption of this clause\n6\n, the directors may remove or change the shareholder's rights to vote or receive dividends in respect of those shares.

Two shareholders entitled to vote on a resolution at the meeting constitute a quorum in all cases. In determining whether a quorum is present, each individual attending as a proxy, attorney or Representative is to be counted, except that where a shareholder has appointed more than one proxy, attorney or Representative, only one is to be counted.\n8.2 If a quorum is present at the time the first item of business is transacted, it is taken to be present when the meeting proceeds to consider each subsequent item of business unless the chairperson of the meeting (on the chairperson's own motion or at the request of a shareholder who is present) declares otherwise.\nEffect of no quorum\n8.3 If a quorum is not present within 30 minutes from the notified starting time for the meeting:\n(a) where the meeting was convened on the requisition of shareholders, the meeting is cancelled; and\n(b) in any other case, the meeting is postponed to the same place on the same day and at the same time the following week, or to any other time and place chosen by the directors.

A director is not required to account to the Company for any profit or benefit arising from their employment by, or contracting with, the Company or any other such company merely because of the director holding office as a director of the Company or because of the fiduciary obligations arising out of that office.\n12.35 The directors may exercise the voting rights conferred by shares in any body corporate held or owned by the Company in such manner as the directors think fit (including voting in favour of any resolution appointing a director as a director or other officer of that body corporate or voting for the payment of remuneration to the directors or other officers of that body corporate) and a director may, if permitted by law, vote in favour of the exercise of those voting rights even though he or she is or may be about to be appointed, a director or other officer of that other body corporate and, as such, interested in the exercise of those voting rights.\n12.36 No contract made by a director with the Company, and no contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any director may be in any way interested, is avoided or rendered voidable merely because of the director holding office as a director of the Company or because of the fiduciary obligations arising out of that office.\n12.37 A director who has a material personal interest in a matter that relates to the affairs of the Company must give the other directors notice of the interest if required to do so under the Corporations Act.\n12.38 If there are not enough directors to form a quorum as a result of a director having an interest which disqualifies them from voting then one or more of the directors (including those who have the disqualifying interest in the matter) may call a general meeting of the Company and the general meeting may pass a resolution to deal with the matter.\n12.39 A director's failure to make disclosure under clause\n12.37\ndoes not render void or voidable a contract or arrangement in which the director has a direct or indirect interest.\n12.40 A director is deemed to be not interested in any contract or arrangement where the only personal interest of the director arises because the director is also a director of a corporation which is taken to be a related body corporate of the Company.\n12.41 A director is not taken to be interested in any contract or proposed contract relating to any loan to the Company by reason only that the director has guaranteed or proposed to guarantee jointly or severally the repayment of the loan.\n12.42 If, because a director is a member of a partnership, or a director or shareholder of another company, or is in a position to control another entity, he or she will be personally interested in any of the Company's contracts or arrangements with that partnership, company or entity, he or she may give the other directors a written notice declaring their relationship to that partnership, company or entity and their consequent interest in all contracts or arrangements with it. The notice is a sufficient declaration of interest in relation to any future contracts or arrangements with that partnership, company or entity.\n12.43 If all other directors are aware that a director is a member of a partnership, or a director or shareholder of another company, or is in a position to control another entity, that fact has the same effect as if the director had given the other directors written notice under clause\n12.42\nat the time all of them as a group first became aware of it.\n12.44 For the purposes of clause\n12.43\n, entity includes a trust or other entity whether it is a legal person or not. The following are examples of a director being in a position to control an entity:\n1.1.1 the director is the appointor of a trust and has power to remove the trustee;\n1.1.2 the director is the sole trustee of a trust; or\n1.1.3 the trustee or trustees of a trust are accustomed to act in accordance with the wishes of the director.\nSecretary\n12.45 The directors must appoint at least one secretary and may appoint additional secretaries. A secretary of the Company holds office on the conditions as to authorities, duties, powers and remuneration, as the directors determine.\nMinutes of meetings\n12.46 The directors must cause minutes to be made of:\n(a) all appointments of officers made by the directors;\n(b) the names of the directors present at each meeting of the directors and of committees formed by the board; and\n(c) all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Company, the directors and any committees.\n12.47 The directors must cause all minutes, except resolutions in writing, to be signed by the chairperson of the meeting at which the proceedings took place or by the chairperson of the next succeeding meeting.\n12.48 Any minutes shall be conclusive evidence of proceedings if they purport to be signed by the chairperson of the meeting at which the proceedings were held or by the chairperson of the next succeeding meeting. Minutes shall be kept by the Company secretary at the registered office of the Company.\n12.49 The directors must comply with the provisions of the Corporations Act in regard to keeping a register of shareholders and to the production and furnishing of copies of or extracts from such register.\n13 Executive Directors\nAppointment\n13.1 The directors may appoint one or more directors to be managing director on the terms and for the length of time that they consider appropriate. The directors may give the managing director any of the powers they can exercise. They may also impose any limitations on the exercise of those powers, and may withdraw or alter the powers they have conferred.\n13.2 The directors may also appoint one or more directors to any other full-time or substantially full-time executive position in the Company on such terms as they think fit.\nCessation of appointment\n13.3 An Executive Director's appointment as a director ends immediately if any of the following happen:\n(a) the period of the appointment ends in accordance with the Executive Director's contract of employment; or\n(b) the Executive Director ceases to be employed by the Company or a related body corporate of the Company unless the Executive Director's contract of employment says otherwise or the directors determine otherwise.\nRemuneration\n13.4 An Executive Director, subject to any agreement entered into in a particular case, may receive such remuneration as the directors determine.\nPowers of managing director\n13.5 Any powers of the directors conferred on the managing director may be concurrent with or to the exclusion of the powers of the directors.\n14 Records\nRecords\n14.1 The directors must determine whether and on what conditions the accounting records and other documents of the Company or any of them are open to the inspection of shareholders other than directors. A person other than a director does not have the right to inspect any document of the Company except as provided by the Corporations Act or authorised by the directors or by the Company in general meeting.\nKeeping records\n14.2 The directors must ensure that proper accounting and other records are kept, and all accounts and other documents are distributed in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act and the Listing Rules.\n15 Auditor\n15.1 The Company must appoint and may only remove an auditor in accordance with the Corporations Act.\n16 Dividends and Reserves\nDetermination to pay a dividend\n16.1 The directors may pay any dividends that, in their judgment, the financial position of the Company justifies.\n16.2 The directors may rescind a decision to pay a dividend, or delay payment of a dividend, if they decide before the payment date, that the Company's financial position no longer justifies the payment or that it is otherwise in the best interests of the company that the dividend decision be rescinded.\n16.3 The directors may pay any dividend required to be paid under the terms of issue of a share.\n16.4 Payment of a dividend does not require confirmation at a general meeting.\n16.5 Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares:\n(a) all dividends must be paid equally on all shares, except that a partly paid share confers an entitlement only to the proportion of the dividend which the amount paid (not credited) on the share is of the total amounts paid and payable (excluding amounts credited);\n(b) an amount paid or credited as paid on a share in advance of a call is not taken to be paid or credited as paid on the share under clause\n16.5(a)\nuntil it becomes payable; and\n(c) interest is not payable by the Company on any dividend.\n16.6 To the extent permitted by law, the directors may resolve to pay a dividend out of any available source.\n16.7 Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, the directors may fix a record date for a dividend.\n16.8 Subject to clause\n4.12\n, a transfer of any share that has not been registered or left with the Company for registration on or before the date determined under clause\n16.7\nis not effective (as against the Company) to pass any right or entitlement in respect of a dividend payable to holders of shares as at that date.\nDeduction from dividends of money owing\n16.9 The directors may deduct from any dividend payable to a shareholder any sums of money (if any) presently payable by the shareholder to the Company and apply the amount so deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owing.\nPayment of dividends and other amounts\n16.10 A dividend (or other amount) payable to a shareholder may be paid:\n(a) by direct payment to the shareholder's bank account;\n(b) by a cheque or warrant posted to any of the following:\n(i) the shareholder's registered address;\n(ii) the registered address of the joint holder of shares who is named first on the register of shareholders; or\n(iii) an address and person nominated by the holder or joint holders of the shares; or\n(c) by another means determined by the directors.\n16.11 A cheque payable under clause\n16.10\nmay be made payable to bearer or to the order of the shareholder to whom it is sent or another person that the shareholder directs and is sent at the shareholder's risk.\n16.12 If:\n(a) a shareholder does not have a registered address or the Company believes that a shareholder is not known at the shareholder's registered address; or\n(b) the directors determine that dividends will be paid by direct payment to the shareholder's bank account in accordance with clause\n16.10(a)\nand:\n(i) no account (of a type approved by the directors) is nominated by a shareholder; or\n(ii) the direct payment into the shareholder's nominated account is rejected or refunded, the Company may credit the amount payable to an account of the Company (\nCompany Account\n) to be held until the shareholder claims the amount payable or nominates a valid account into which payment may be made.\n16.13 The Company does not hold any money in the Company Account as a trustee and no interest will be paid to the shareholder on monies held in the Company Account unless the directors determine otherwise.\n16.14 An amount credited to the Company Account is treated as paid to the shareholder at the time it is credited to the Company Account.\n16.15 If:\n(a) a cheque for an amount payable under clause\n16.10(b)\nis not presented for payment; or\n(b) an amount is held in the Company Account,\nfor more than 11 calendar months, the directors may stop the payment. The money may be used for the benefit of the Company until claimed or disposed of in accordance with the laws relating to unclaimed monies.\n16.16 If the directors exercise their power to reinvest under clause\n16.15\nand there are residual amounts remaining, the residual amounts may be retained in the Company Account or donated to a charity on behalf of the shareholder, as the directors decide.\n16.17 The Company's liability to pay the relevant dividend amount in respect of a shareholder to which clauses\n16.10\nto\n16.19\napply, is discharged when shares are issued or transferred to that shareholder in accordance with\n16.15\n.\n16.18 The directors may do anything necessary or desirable (including executing any document) on behalf of the shareholder to effect the reinvestment under clause\n16.15\nor donation under clause\n16.16\n.\n16.19 The directors may determine other rules to regulate the operation of clauses\n16.10\nto\n16.19\nand may delegate their power under this rule to any person.\nTransfer of assets\n16.20 The directors may direct payment of the dividend wholly or partly by distribution of specific assets (including shares or securities of any body corporate or trust) to some or all of the members. The directors may determine in respect of the payment of any dividend to allow members to elect to receive the amount of the dividend to which that member is entitled in shares instead of in cash.\n16.21 To give effect to any direction, the directors may do all things that they consider appropriate including:\n(a) fixing the value for distribution of any specific asset or any part of any such asset; or\n(b) making a cash payment to any member to adjust the value of distributions made to members.\nAuthority to capitalise profits\n16.22 Subject to the Corporations Act, this constitution, the Listing Rules and the terms of issue of shares (or classes of shares), the directors may resolve to capitalise any amount:\n(a) forming part of the undivided profits of the Company;\n(b) representing profits arising from an ascertained accretion to capital or a revaluation of the assets of the Company;\n(c) arising from the realisation of any assets of the Company; or\n(d) otherwise available for distribution as a dividend.\n16.23 If the directors exercise their powers pursuant to clause\n16.22\n, they must not pay the amount in cash, but must use it to benefit those shareholders who are entitled to dividends in the proportions that would apply if the entire amount of the profits to be capitalised were a dividend. The benefit must be given in one (or partly in one and partly in the other) of the following ways:\n(a) paying up the amounts unpaid on the shareholder's shares;\n(b) paying up in full unissued shares to be issued to shareholders as fully paid;\n(c) partly paying up any amount unpaid on any share and paying up in full unissued shares to be issued as fully paid;\n(d) issuing shares or debentures of the Company to the shareholder; or\n(e) any other method permitted by law.\n16.24 The amount capitalised must be applied for the benefit of shareholders in the proportions in which the shareholders would have been entitled to dividends if the amount capitalised had been distributed as a dividend. If fractions of shares or debentures are initially allocated, the directors may, in their discretion:\n(a) issue fractional certificates in the case of unquoted shares;\n(b) pay the shareholder the cash equivalent of the fraction; or\n(c) round up or down the final allocation.\nAncillary powers\n16.25 To give effect to any resolution to reduce the capital of the Company, to satisfy a dividend as set out in clause\n16.20\nor to capitalise any amount under clause\n16.22\nthe directors may settle as they think expedient any difficulty that arises in making the distribution or capitalisation and, in particular:\n(a) make cash payments in cases where shareholders are entitled to fractions of shares or other securities;\n(b) decide that amounts or fractions of less than a particular value decided by the directors may be disregarded or rounded up or down to the nearest whole share to adjust the rights of all parties;\n(c) fix the value for distribution of any specific assets;\n(d) pay cash or issue shares or other securities to any shareholder to adjust the rights of all parties;\n(e) vest any of those specific assets, cash, shares or other securities in a trustee on trust for the persons entitled to the distribution or capitalised amount; and\n(f) authorise any person to make, on behalf of all the shareholders entitled to any specific assets, cash, shares or other securities as a result of the distribution or capitalisation, an agreement with the Company or another person which provides, as appropriate, for the distribution or issue to them of shares or other securities credited as fully paid up or for payment by the Company on their behalf of the amounts or any part of the amounts remaining unpaid on their existing shares or other securities by applying their respective proportions of the amount resolved to be distributed or capitalised.\n16.26 Any agreement made under an authority referred to in clause\n16.25(f)\nis effective and binds all shareholders concerned.\n16.27 If a distribution, transfer or issue of specific assets, shares or securities to a particular shareholder or shareholders is, in the directors' discretion, considered impracticable or would give rise to parcels of securities that do not constitute a marketable parcel, the directors may make a cash payment to those shareholders or allocate the assets, shares or securities to a trustee to be sold on behalf of, and for the benefit of, those shareholders, instead of making the distribution, transfer or issue to those shareholders. Any proceeds receivable by shareholders under this clause\n16.27\nwill be net of expenses incurred by the Company and trustee in selling the relevant assets, shares or securities.\n16.28 If the Company distributes to shareholders (either generally or to specific shareholders) securities in the Company or in another body corporate or trust (whether as a dividend or otherwise and whether or not for value), each of those shareholders agrees to become a shareholder or interest holder of that body corporate or trust and appoints the Company and each director as their agent to do anything needed to give effect to that distribution.\nReserves\n16.29 Before determining that a dividend be paid, the directors may set aside out of the Company's profit any amount that they consider appropriate. This amount does not need to be kept separate from the Company's other assets and may be used in any way that profits can be used and can be invested or used in the Company's business in the interim. However, it must not be used to buy the Company's shares.\n16.30 The directors may appropriate to the profits of the Company any amount previously set aside as a reserve or provision.\n16.31 The directors may carry forward any part of the profits remaining that they consider should not be distributed as dividends or capitalised, without transferring those profits to a reserve or provision.\nDividend reinvestment plans\n16.32 The directors may implement a dividend reinvestment plan on the terms they think fit under which the whole or any part of a dividend due to shareholders who participate in the plan on their shares or any class of shares may be applied in subscribing for securities of the Company or of another body corporate or trust.\n16.33 The directors may amend, suspend or terminate a dividend reinvestment plan implemented by them.\nDividend selection plan\n16.34 The directors may implement a dividend selection plan on the terms they think fit under which participants may elect in respect of all, or part, of their shareholdings:\n(a) to receive a dividend from the Company paid wholly or partly out of a particular fund or reserve or out of profits derived from a particular source; or\n(b) to forego a dividend from the Company in place of another form of distribution from the Company or another body corporate or trust.\n16.35 The directors may amend, suspend or terminate any dividend selection plan implemented by them.\nBonus share plan\n16.36 The directors may:\n(a) implement a bonus share plan on such terms as they think fit under which participants may elect to forgo the whole or any part of any dividend due to them on their shares and, in lieu of that dividend, be issued bonus shares in the company; and\n(b) amend, suspend or terminate any bonus share plan so implemented.\n17 Winding Up\nDivision of property among shareholders\n17.1 If the Company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution, divide among the shareholders in kind the whole or any part of the property of the Company. For this purpose the liquidator may set such value as the liquidator considers fair on any property to be so divided and may determine how the division is to be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders. A division under this clause\n17.1\nneed not accord with the legal rights of the shareholders and, in particular, any class may be given preferential or special rights or may be excluded altogether or in part.\n17.2 Where a division under clause\n17.1\ndoes not accord with the legal rights of the shareholders, a shareholder is entitled to dissent and to exercise the same rights as if the special resolution sanctioning that division were a special resolution passed under section 507 of the Corporations Act.\n17.3 If any of the property to be divided under clause\n17.1\nincludes shares with a liability to calls, any person entitled under the division to any of the shares may, within 10 days after the passing of the special resolution referred to in that clause, by written notice direct the liquidator to sell the person's proportion of the shares and to account for the net proceeds. The liquidator must, if practicable, act accordingly.\n17.4 Nothing in clauses\n17.1\nto\n17.5\ntakes away from or affects any right to exercise any statutory or other power which would have existed if these clauses were omitted.\n17.5 Clause\n16.25\napplies, so far as it can and with any necessary changes, to a division by a liquidator under clause\n17.1\nas if references in clause\n16.25\nto the directors and to a distribution or capitalisation were respectively references to the liquidator and to the division under clause\n17.1\n.\nVesting property on trustees\n17.6 The liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution, vest the whole or any part of any property in trustees on such trusts for the benefit of contributories as the liquidator thinks fit, but so that no shareholder is compelled to accept any shares or other shares in respect of which there is any liability.\n18 Proportional Takeover Bid\n18.1 Registration of a transfer giving effect to a contract resulting from the acceptance of an offer made under a proportional takeover bid is prohibited unless and until an Approving Resolution approving the proportional takeover bid is passed or taken to have been passed in accordance with this clause\n18\n.\n18.2 A person (other than the bidder or an associate of the bidder) who, as at the end of the day on which the first offer under the proportional takeover bid was made, held bid class shares is entitled to:\n(a) vote on an Approving Resolution; and\n(b) has one vote for each bid class Share held.\n18.3 Where offers have been made under a proportional takeover bid, the directors must ensure that an Approving Resolution is voted on at a meeting of the persons described in clause\n18.2\nbefore the Approving Resolution Deadline.\n18.4 An Approving Resolution is passed if more than 50% of the votes cast on the resolution are cast in favour of the resolution and otherwise is taken to have been rejected.\n18.5 The provisions of this constitution that apply to a general meeting of the Company apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to a meeting that is called under this clause\n18\nas if the meeting was a general meeting of the Company.\n18.6 If an Approving Resolution to approve the proportional takeover bid is voted on in accordance with this clause\n18\nbefore the Approving Resolution Deadline, the Company must, on or before the Approving Resolution Deadline, give the bidder and ASX a written notice stating that an Approving Resolution to approve the proportional takeover bid has been voted on and whether it was passed or rejected.\n18.7 If no resolution has been voted on in accordance with this clause\n18\nas at the end of the day before the Approving Resolution Deadline, a resolution to approve the proportional takeover bid is taken, for the purposes of this clause\n18\n, to have been passed in accordance with this clause\n18\n.\n18.8 Under the Corporations Act, this clause\n18\nwill automatically cease to have effect on the third anniversary of the date of its adoption or as of its most recent renewal.\n18.9 In this clause\n18\n:\nApproving Resolution\nmeans an ordinary resolution passed by shareholders approving the transfer giving effect to contracts resulting from the acceptance of an offer made under a proportional takeover; and\nApproving Resolution Deadline\nin relation to a proportional takeover bid means the day that is the 14th day before the last day of the bid period.\n19 Notices\nExtended meaning\n19.1 In this clause\n19\n, 'notice' includes documents and other communication, and in this constitution, a reference to a written notice includes a notice given by fax or other electronic means.

A notice sent by post must be addressed by name, or by the title of representative of the deceased or assignee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at the address (if any) supplied for the purpose by the person or, if such an address has not been supplied, at the address to which the notice might have been sent if the death or bankruptcy had not occurred.\nPersons entitled to notice\n19.10 Notice of every general meeting must be given in the manner authorised by this constitution to:\n(a) every shareholder;\n(b) every person entitled to a share due to the death or bankruptcy of a shareholder who, but for the shareholder's death or bankruptcy, would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting;\n(c) the directors; and\n(d) the auditor of the Company.\n19.11 No other person is entitled to receive a notice of general meeting.\nPersons entitled to shares\n19.12 A person who by operation of law, transfer or other means becomes entitled to any share is bound by every notice given in accordance with this clause\n19\nto the person from whom that person derives title prior to registration of that person in the register.\n20 Indemnity\n20.1 To the extent permitted by law and subject to the restrictions in the Corporations Act, the Company must indemnify every person who is or has been an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company (where the Company requested the officer to accept that appointment) against liability (including liability for costs and expenses) incurred by that person as an officer of the Company or subsidiary as the case may be. However, this does not apply in respect of any of the following:\n(a) a liability to the Company or a related body corporate;\n(b) a liability to some other person that arises out of conduct involving a lack of good faith;\n(c) a liability for costs and expenses incurred by the officer in defending civil or criminal proceedings in which judgment is given against the officer or in which the officer is not acquitted; or\n(d) a liability for costs and expenses incurred by the officer in connection with an unsuccessful application for relief under the Corporations Act, in connection with the proceedings referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n20.2 Without limiting clause\n20.1\n, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the restrictions in the Corporations Act, the Company must indemnify and continually indemnify every person who is or has been an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company (where the Company requested the officer to accept that appointment) against reasonable legal costs incurred in defending an action for a liability incurred or allegedly incurred by that person as an officer of the Company or subsidiary as the case may be.\n20.3 The amount of any indemnity payable under clauses\n20.1\nand\n20.2\nwill include an additional amount (GST Amount) equal to any GST payable by the officer being indemnified (Indemnified Officer) in connection with the indemnity (less the amount of any input tax credit claimable by the Indemnified Officer in connection with the indemnity). Payment of any indemnity which includes a GST Amount is conditional upon the Indemnified Officer providing the Company with a GST tax invoice for the GST Amount.\n20.4 The directors may agree to advance to an officer an amount which it might otherwise be liable to pay to the officer under clause\n20.1\non such terms as the directors think fit but which are consistent with this clause, pending the outcome of any findings of a relevant court or tribunal which would have a bearing on whether the Company is in fact liable to indemnify the officer under clause\n20.1\n. If after the Company makes the advance, the directors form the view that the Company is not liable to indemnify the officer, the Company may recover any advance from the officer as a debt due by the officer to the Company.\nFormer officers\n20.5 Each of the indemnities in this clause\n20\nare continuing indemnities which apply in respect of all acts done by a person while an officer of the Company or one of its subsidiaries even though the person is not an officer at the time the claim is made.\nInsurance premiums\n20.6 The Company may pay the premium on a policy of insurance in respect of a person who is or has been an officer of the Company (where the Company requested the officer to accept that appointment), to the full extent permitted by the Corporations Act.\n21 Security Interests\n21.1 If any provision of this constitution creates a security interest in shares or other personal property (\nCollateral\n) to which the PPSA applies:\n(a) the Company need not comply with any provisions of the PPSA that the parties may contract out of in relation to the Collateral; and\n(b) shareholders may not exercise any rights under sections 142 (redemption of collateral) or 143 (reinstatement of security agreement) of the PPSA to the extent the law permits those rights to be excluded.\n21.2 The Company need not give the shareholder any other notice required under the PPSA (including a notice of verification statements under section 157 of the PPSA) unless the notice cannot be excluded.\n22 Seals\nAdoption of Common Seal\n22.1 The directors may provide for the Company to have a seal or for the Company to no longer have a common seal.\n22.2 Clauses\n22.3\nto\n22.10\nonly apply if the Company has a common seal.\nUse of Seal\n22.3 The Seal must be used only by the authority of the directors or a committee of the directors authorised by the directors to authorise the use of the Seal.\n22.4 The authority to use the Seal may be given before or after the Seal is used.\n22.5 Subject to clauses\n22.4\nand\n22.10\n, until the directors otherwise determine, the fixing of the Seal to a document must be witnessed by a director and by another director, a secretary or another person appointed by the directors to witness that document or a class of documents in which that document is included.\nDuplicate seal\n22.6 The Company may have for use in place of its common seal outside the state or territory where its common seal is kept one or more duplicate seals, each of which must be a facsimile of the common seal of the Company with the addition on its face of the words \"duplicate seal\" and the name of the place where it is to be used.\n22.7 A document sealed with a duplicate seal is to be taken as having been sealed with the common seal of the Company.\nShare seal or certificate seal\n22.8 The Company may have for use on certificates for securities of the Company in place of its common seal one or more duplicate seals, each of which must be a facsimile of the common seal of the Company with the addition on its face of the words \"share seal\" or \"certificate seal\".\n22.9 A certificate for securities of the Company sealed with a share seal or certificate seal or in the manner contemplated in clause\n22.10\nis to be taken as having been sealed with the common seal of the Company.\nSealing and signing of certificates\n22.10 The directors may determine either generally or in a particular case that the seal and the signature of any director, secretary or other person is to be printed on or affixed to any certificates for securities in the Company by some mechanical or other means.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The certificate of discontinuance will provide prima facie evidence that all the requirements of the BVI Business Companies Act in respect of the continuation of a company under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction have been complied with, and that the Company was discontinued on the date specified in the certificate of discontinuance. European Metals will be domiciled in Australia and will be a company governed under the\nCorporations Act 2001\n(Cth) (\"\nAustralian Continuance\n\"). The new constitution will replace the existing Articles of Association of the Company and the Company's registered office will change to Level 3, 88 William Street, Perth WA 6000.\nThe Board believes that the Australian Continuance should lead to substantial cost savings and improvements in the Company's administration and efficiency of operations. Additionally, it will remove a potential impediment to obtaining European development financial assistance for the Cinovec project.\nThe redomiciliation will represent a re-admission to AIM. As a quoted applicant under AIM Rule 2 of the AIM Rules for Companies, the Company has provided the London Stock Exchange with the information specified by Schedule One of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nSchedule One\n\") on the 4th of April 2024, being at least 20 business days before the expected date of re-admission to AIM. On readmission, the Company confirms its ISIN as AU000000EMH5 and SEDOL as BSC9SJ5.\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the readmission of 207,444,705 ordinary shares of no par value (\"\nShares\n\"), held as Shares in Australia and via Depository Interests (\"\nDIs\n\") in the UK, to trading on AIM. It is expected that readmission will become effective and dealings in the Shares commence on AIM at 8.00 a.m. on or around 10 May 2024.\nTo be traded on AIM, securities including DIs must be able to be held, transferred and settled electronically through CREST, the UK clearing and settlement system. Ordinary Shares held on the Australian share register may be converted on a 1:1 basis into DIs held in CREST on the UK depositary register and vice versa. The Shares will be listed and traded on the ASX, with trades settled electronically on the Australian register through CHESS, the Australian clearing and settlement system.\nASX Timetable\nAs part of the Australian Continuance, all securityholders who previously held their securities in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests (\"\nCDIs\n\") will then hold Shares directly in the Company rather than through the CDI nominee and those Shares will be tradeable on ASX.

Geomet has been granted a preliminary mining permit by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Industry. The company is owned 49% by EMH and 51% by CEZ a.s. through its wholly owned subsidiary, SDAS. Cinovec hosts a globally significant hard rock lithium deposit with a total Measured Mineral Resource of 53.3Mt at 0.48% Li2O, Indicated Mineral Resource of 360.2Mt at 0.44% Li2O and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 294.7Mt at 0.39% Li2O containing a combined 7.39 million tonnes Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/AIM release dated\n13 October 2021\n)\n(\nResource Upgrade at Cinovec Lithium Project\n).\nAn initial Probable Ore Reserve of 34.5Mt at 0.65% Li2O reported 4 July 2017 (\nCinovec Maiden Ore Reserve - Further Information\n) has been declared to cover the first 20 years mining at an output of 22,500tpa of lithium carbonate (\nrefer to the Company's ASX/AIM release dated\n11 July 2018) (\nCinovec Production Modelled to Increase to 22,500tpa of Lithium Carbonate\n).\nThis makes Cinovec the largest hard rock lithium deposit in Europe and the fifth largest non-brine deposit in the world.\nThe deposit has previously had over 400,000 tonnes of ore mined as a trial sub-level open stope underground mining operation.\nOn 19 January 2022, EMH provided an update to the 2019 PFS Update. It confirmed the deposit is amenable to bulk underground mining (refer to the Company's ASX/AIM release dated 19 January 2022) (\nPFS Update delivers outstanding results\n). Metallurgical test-work has produced both battery-grade lithium hydroxide and battery-grade lithium carbonate at excellent recoveries. In February 2023 DRA Global Limited (\"DRA\") was appointed to complete the Definitive Feasibility Study (\"DFS\").\nCinovec is centrally located for European end-users and is well serviced by infrastructure, with a sealed road adjacent to the deposit, rail lines located 5 km north and 8 km south of the deposit, and an active 22 kV transmission line running to the historic mine. The deposit lies in an active mining region.\nThe economic viability of Cinovec has been enhanced by the recent push for supply security of critical raw materials for battery production, including the strong increase in demand for lithium globally, and within Europe specifically, as demonstrated by the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA).\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CEZ\nHeadquartered in the Czech Republic, CEZ a.s. is one of the largest companies in the Czech Republic and a leading energy group operating in Western and Central Europe. CEZ's core business is the generation, distribution, trade in, and sales of electri\ncity and heat, trade in and sales of natural gas, and coal extraction. The foundation of power generation at CEZ Group are emission-free sources. The CEZ strategy named Clean Energy for Tomorrow is based on ambitious decarbonisation, development of renewable sources and nuclear energy. CEZ announced that it would move forward its climate neutrality commitment by ten years to 2040.\nThe largest shareholder of its parent company, CEZ a.s., is the Czech Republic\u00a0with a stake of approximately 70%. The shares of CEZ a.s. are traded on the Prague and Warsaw stock exchanges and included in the PX and WIG-CEE exchange indices. CEZ's market capitalization is approximately EUR 20.3 billion.\nAs one of the leading Central European power companies, CEZ intends to develop\nseveral projects in areas of\nenergy storage\nand battery manufacturing\nin the Czech Republic and in Central Europe.\nCEZ is also a market leader for E-mobility in the region and has installed and operates a network of EV charging stations throughout Czech Republic. The automotive industry in the Czech Republic is a significant contributor to GDP, and the number of EV's in the country is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.\nCAUTION REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nInformation included in this release constitutes forward-looking statements.
