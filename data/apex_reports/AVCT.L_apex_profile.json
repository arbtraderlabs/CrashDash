Any failure to pre-register will not, of itself, preclude a registered shareholder from attending the AGM in person (or by proxy).\nOnly registered shareholders who attend in person or by proxy will be able to vote on the day. Details of how to submit a proxy vote are contained in the Notice of the AGM.\nThe Company will provide a business update following the AGM, which will be recorded and uploaded on the Company's website for shareholders who are not able to attend in person. All presentation materials will be made available on the website at the end of the day and no new material information will be provided.\nEarly pre-registration to attend the AGM in person is recommended as the venue's capacity is limited (as referred to above) and, for non-registered shareholders, registrations will be dealt with on a first come, first served basis.

The pre|CISION\u00ae platform uniquely enables the repurposing of a range of oncology drugs as PDC payloads with the goal to significantly reduce toxicity and side effects for patients by concentrating the drug directly in the tumor.\nAbout pre|CISION\u00ae\nThe key aspect of pre|CISION\u00ae is its peptide drug conjugates (PDC) technology. The combination of the cancer drug and the proprietary cleavable peptide (the PDC) is inert and incapable of entering cells and killing them until the peptide is specifically released within the tumor. The active payload in the pre|CISION\u00ae PDC is released when the PDC comes into contact with the common tumor-associated protein, known as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), in the tumor. The release of the payload from the pre|CISION\u00ae product directly in the tumor results in higher concentration of the drug at the tumor and lower blood and healthy tissue levels than standard systemic administration, offering the potential to improve efficacy and patient tolerability.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As of the most recent data cut-off, the favorable safety profile continues to be observed when compared with conventional dose doxorubicin, including no observed events of severe cardiac toxicity, which are associated with conventional doxorubicin.\nAmong patients in the dose-escalation portion, 11 patients with salivary gland cancers have been treated with AVA6000 at or above the dose of 250 mg/m2 and above. Among these 11 patients, one patient experienced a confirmed partial response as best response (greater than -30% reduction in tumor diameters by RECIST criteria), four patients had minor responses (-10 to -29% reduction by RECIST criteria), and only one patient had disease progression for a disease control rate of 91%. These responses have been durable to date. Importantly, the median PFS has not yet been reached, as five patients remain on AVA6000 treatment and 9 of the 11 patients are without progression and remain in follow-up. The median time of follow-up in this cohort is approximately 5 months. These data compare very favorably to published PFS reports (with conventional anti-cancer therapy) in this setting of pre-treated SGC, is reported at approximately 3.5 months. It is anticipated that PFS would be the primary endpoint in the registrational trial of AVA6000 in this indication, which is characterized by low response rates and high unmet need.\nAvacta also announces patient dosing in the AVA6000 Phase 1b expansion cohorts with multiple patients treated in this portion of the trial, which include three indications: (1) salivary gland cancer, (2) triple negative breast cancer and (3) high grade soft tissue sarcoma. Each arm of the Phase 1b expansion cohort will enroll 20-30 patients by the following criteria.\n\u00b7\nSalivary gland cancers\n: patients with advanced or metastatic salivary gland cancers of any histologic subtype. Patients may have received up to 1 prior line of therapy in the metastatic or advanced setting.\n\u00b7\nTriple negative breast cancer\n: patients with advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer with up to 2 prior lines of therapy in the metastatic or advanced setting\n\u00b7\nHigh grade soft tissue sarcomas:\npatients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma and patients may have received 0 or 1 prior line of therapy in the metastatic or advanced setting\nThe Company anticipates providing a further update from the Phase 1a dose escalation data in 2Q 2025 and Phase 1b dose expansion cohort data at the end of 2025. The full Phase 1a data will be presented in 2H 2025, including a full assessment of the cardiac safety data with long-term follow up. The data will allow the Company to plan for the registration study of AVA6000.\nAlan Ho, MD\nPhD,\u00a0Chief of the Head and Neck Oncology Service,\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and member, Avacta Scientific Advisory Board, commented:\n\"We are very excited to move the development of AVA6000 to the next level\u00a0to generate\u00a0data that demonstrates\u00a0clinically meaningful efficacy and durability of response in patients with previously treated salivary gland cancers. It is important to note the high degree of unmet need in this disease where few agents have shown efficacy. I am happy to participate in the trials of AVA6000 in this disease setting going forward.\"\nChristina Coughlin, CEO of Avacta Therapeutics\ncommented:\n\"We are very pleased to advance to the expansion cohorts in the AVA6000 trial in these three indications with high unmet need. Our development of AVA6000 is proceeding according to plans and today's new data demonstrate the durability of the responses we have observed in the SGC indication. We believe that AVA6000 has an important role to play in the clinic, given our preliminary efficacy data and the large commercial market size of conventional doxorubicin\"\n-Ends-\nFor further information from Avacta, please contact:\nAvacta Group plc\nMichael Vinegrad, Group Communications\nDirector\nwww.avacta.com\nPeel Hunt (Nomad and Broker)\nJames Steel / Chris Golden / Patrick Birkholm\nwww.peelhunt.com\nPanmure Liberum (Joint Broker)\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Mark Rogers\nwww.panmureliberum.com\nICR Healthcare\nMary-Jane Elliott / Jessica Hodgson / Stephanie Cuthbert\navacta@icrhealthcare.com\nInvestor Contact\nRenee Leck\nTHRUST Strategic Communications\nrenee@thrustsc.com\nMedia Contact\nCarly Scaduto\nCarly Scaduto Consulting\nCarly@carlyscadutoconsulting.com\nAbout Avacta\n-\nwww.avacta.com\nAvacta Therapeutics is a clinical-stage life sciences company expanding the reach of highly potent cancer therapies with the pre|CISION\u00ae\u00a0platform. pre|CISION\u00ae\u00a0is a\u00a0proprietary payload delivery system\nbased on a tumor-specific protease (fibroblast activation protein or FAP)\u00a0that is designed to concentrate highly potent payloads in the tumor microenvironment while sparing normal tissues. Our innovative pipeline consists of pre|CISION\u00ae\u00a0peptide drug conjugates (PDC) or Affimer\u00ae\u00a0drug conjugates (AffDC) that leverage the tumor-specific release mechanism, providing unique benefits over traditional antibody drug conjugates.\nAbout the pre|CISION\u00ae Platform\nThe pre|CISION\u00ae platform comprises an anticancer payload conjugated to a proprietary peptide that is a highly specific substrate for fibroblast activation protein (FAP) which is upregulated in most solid tumors compared with healthy tissues. The pre|CISION\u00ae platform harnesses this tumor specific protease to cleave pre|CISION\u00ae peptide drug conjugates and pre|CISION\u00ae antibody/Affimer\u00ae drug conjugates in the tumor microenvironment, thus releasing active payload in the tumor and reducing systemic exposure and toxicity, allowing dosing to be optimized to deliver the best outcomes for patients.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
