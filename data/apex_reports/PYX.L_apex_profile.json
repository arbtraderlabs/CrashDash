This success highlights the impact of our strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies. Our EBITDA for the period reached US$22.8k, a significant turnaround from the negative US$9.8 million recorded during the same period last year.\nEven more encouraging is the performance of our underlying EBITDA, which has risen by over 457% to US$732k compared to US$131k in the first half of 2023. This substantial improvement reflects the success of our efforts to optimise production and control costs, positioning PYX for sustainable profitability moving forward.\nFurthermore, PYX continues to maintain a robust balance sheet and remains debt-free, a testament to our prudent financial management; we closed the period with a solid cash position of US$7.6 million.\nThis is a result of an increase in net cash used in operating working capital of US$1.2m, US$0.7m investment in capex and a positive US$1.7m as a result of financial activities, mainly showing the strong support of our shareholders.\nThis financial stability provides us with the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, both organically and opportunistically through acquisitions, with the aim of becoming a consolidator of mineral sands in Indonesia and further enhancing shareholder value.\nOperationally, heavy rain in May and June and the collapse of a bridge providing access to the mine impacted operations during the period with a 20% reduction in the production of zircon to 4.5kt (2023: 5.7kt) and a 16% reduction in total mineral sands (zircon, rutile and ilmenite) produced to 5.7kt (2023: 6.8kt). Despite this, we were able to sell almost everything we produced, resulting in an 84% increase in total mineral sands sold in comparison to 5.2kt in 2023; a great achievement which validates our decision to diversify our client base.\nSeveral operational advancements and strategic milestones were achieved in the first six months of 2024. Perhaps the most significant in terms of long-term cost benefits was the successful connection of the Mandiri Mineral Separation Plant to the local electricity grid of Kalimantan estimated to save up to 80% in the cost of fuel and to reduce carbon emissions. This not only streamlines our energy costs but also supports our broader sustainability goals, positioning PYX as a leader in the responsible extraction and processing of critical minerals.\nPYX was granted two key\nWork Programme & Budget licences / Rencana Kerja dan Anggaran Biaya (\"WP&B\"/ \"RKAB\") received from the Indonesian Energy and Mineral Resources Department (\"ESDM\")\nenabling us to ramp up production and to meet the increasing global demand for these critical minerals. A two-year licence allowing us to produce up to 94kt per annum (\"ktpa\") of Premium zircon, ilmenite, and rutile at Mandiri. Under the terms of the licence, PYX is authorised to export 24ktpa of premium zircon with grades of 65.5%, 50ktpa Wet Ton (\"WE\")/year of ilmenite with 45% grades and 20ktpa WE/year of rutile with 90% grades. Additionally, post period-end we announced a three-year licence for our Tisma Project (\"Tisma\") to extract and process up to 88.8kt minerals. With a 27% recovery factor, this enables the production of circa 8ktpa of premium zircon of which 6.4ktpa may be exported and 1.6ktpa can be sold to domestic Indonesian markets. Importantly, the terms of the licences allow us to export 80% of the minerals produced to overseas market, where we can command more favourable prices. This not only enhances our revenue potential but also reinforces our position in the global market.\nIn March, we were thrilled to announce the first export of ilmenite to a customer in Zhanjiang, China, following the award of the modified licence to export ilmenite announced on the 12th of March 2024. Client orders had been placed on hold following a modification to the original rutile and ilmenite licences announced in August 2023 and January 2024 respectively and the Company had been stockpiling TiO2. PYX currently has an inventory of 1,090 tonnes of Premium Zircon, 5,673 tonnes of Ilmenite and 352 tonnes of Rutile.\nWe are deeply committed to maintaining and upholding the highest ESG standards and were therefore honoured by the Zircon Industry Association (\"ZIA\") with the prestigious Gold ESG Excellence Award. As the trade association is representing approximately 80% of global zircon and zirconia production, the ZIA's Gold ESG Excellence Award is among the highest honours in the ESG reporting and rating process. This accolade recognized our ongoing dedication to exemplary ESG practices and responsible business stewardship.\nThese developments highlight our commitment to driving value for our shareholders while contributing to the broader economic landscape in Indonesia. As we move forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy, leveraging our operational efficiencies, and capitalising on the opportunities presented by our enhanced production capabilities.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, PYX remains bullish on the prospects for mineral sands, particularly premium zircon. The market dynamics continue to favour strong pricing driven by a supply-demand deficit. With a limited number of mines producing zircon and some of those nearing the end of their life, the pressure on the market to secure alternative supply sources will be intensifying in the future. This scenario presents a significant opportunity for PYX to capitalise on its position as a reliable and high-quality producer.\nWe are optimistic that the operational improvements and efficiencies implemented on-site will begin to yield substantial benefits in the second half of the year. As we ramp up production and increase our sales volumes, we expect these efforts to enhance our financial performance and to strengthen our market position. We remain committed to meeting the growing global demand for premium zircon and other mineral sands, and we are confident in our ability to deliver continued growth and value for our shareholders.\nOliver Hasler\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n2024 HALF YEAR RESULTS PRESENTATION\nThe Company's results interview with Oliver Hasler, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer is available to watch via the focusIR platform on:\nhttps://youtu.be/JTlkQEq9yWA\nENDS\nFor more information:\nPYX Resources Limited\nT: +61 2 8823 3132\nE:\nir@pyxresources.com\nZeus Capital Limited (Broker)\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Darshan Patel\nT: +44 (0)20 3829 5000\nSt Brides Partners Ltd (Financial PR)\nAna Ribeiro / Isabel de Salis\nE:\npyx@stbridespartners.co.uk\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Oliver B.

Significant accounting policies\na. Basis of Preparation\nThese general purpose interim financial statements for half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2024 have been prepared in accordance with requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134: Interim Financial Reporting. The Group is a for-profit entity for financial reporting purposes under Australian Accounting Standards.\nThis interim financial report is intended to provide users with an update on the latest annual financial statements of Pyx Resources Limited and its controlled entities (referred to as the \"Consolidated Group\" or \"Group\"). As such, it does not contain information that represents relatively insignificant changes occurring during the half-year within the Group. It is therefore recommended that this financial report be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the group for the year ended 31 December 2023, together with any public announcements made during the following half-year.\nThese interim financial statements were authorised for issue on 13 September 2024.\nb. Accounting Policies\nThe same accounting policies and methods of computation have been followed in this interim financial report as were applied in the most recent annual financial statements.\nThe group has considered the implications of new or amended Accounting Standards, but determined that their application to the financial statements is either not relevant or not material.\ni). Fair Value Measurement\nWhen an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.\nFair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use.

According to government statements, the move is driven by the need to address oversupply, improve market stability, and enhance regulatory oversight across multiple mining sectors-including coal, bauxite, nickel, and mineral sands.\n[1]\nThe Company confirms that its IUP license for the Mandiri deposit expired on 31 August 2025. Due to the current regulatory uncertainty,\nPYX is forced to postpone the renewal of its license\n, resulting in a temporary suspension of operations at Mandiri. This development has had a direct and material impact on the Company's production and commercial activities.\nWhile PYX supports the government's broader objectives to strengthen governance and transparency, the abrupt nature of the policy shift has created significant uncertainty for mining operators. The lack of a clear transitional framework has left companies like PYX unable to proceed with license renewals, despite a long-standing commitment to responsible mining.\nAccording to FerroAlloyNet, the new RKAB framework has \"aroused suspicion in the industry,\" with experts warning that the shift to annual approvals could destabilize production planning and overwhelm regulatory systems. Singgih Widagdo, Chairman of the Indonesian Mining & Energy Forum (IMEF), emphasized that Indonesia's 4,100+ active mining permits would be difficult to manage under a yearly approval cycle. He argued that the previous three-year RKAB system allowed for more realistic production targets and long-term planning, citing coal output projections of 922.16 million tons for 2024 as an example.\n[2]\nPYX remains committed to its long-term strategy of consolidating mineral sands resources.\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments and provide further updates as appropriate\n*** ENDS\n***\nFor more information:\nPYX Resources Limited\nT: +61 2 8823 3132\nE:\nir@pyxresources.com\nZeus (Broker)\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Darshan Patel\nT: +44 (0)20 3 829 5000\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Oliver B.

PYX's key deposits, Mandiri and Tisma, are large-scale, near-surface open pit deposits both located in the alluvium-rich region of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. PYX, whose Mandiri deposit has been in production since 2015, is the 3rd largest publicly traded producing mineral sands company by zircon resources globally. Determined to mine responsibly and invest in the wider communities where we operate, PYX is committed to fully developing its Mandiri and Tisma deposits, with the vision to consolidate the mineral sands resources in Kalimantan and explore and acquire mineral sands assets in Asia and beyond.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING\nINFORMATION\nThis Announcement contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Australian and UK securities laws, which are based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the date of this Announcement.\nThis forward-looking information includes, or may be based upon, without limitation, estimates, forecasts and statements as to management's expectations with respect to, among other things, the timing and amount of funding required to execute the Company's exploration, development and business plans, capital and exploration expenditures, the effect on the Company of any changes to existing legislation or policy, government regulation of mining operations, the length of time required to obtain permits, certifications and approvals, the success of exploration, development and mining activities, the geology of the Company's properties, environmental risks, the availability of labour, the focus of the Company in the future, demand and market outlook for precious metals and the prices thereof, progress in development of mineral properties, the Company's ability to raise funding privately or on a public market in the future, the Company's future growth, results of operations, performance, and business prospects and opportunities.

However, the second half was impacted by adverse weather, infrastructure disruptions, and declining mineral sands prices, resulting in reduced production and lower average realised prices.\nIn the first half of 2025, PYX did not undertake production activities. This decision was made in response to:\n\u00b7\nContinued weakness in global mineral sands pricing;\n\u00b7\nElevated operating costs, particularly from third-party contract mining arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nA steep increase in regional royalties from approx. US$8 per tonne to US$59 per tonne, as announced by PYX on 28 February 2025.\nIn addition, PYX has been navigating a complex regulatory environment in Indonesia following the recent presidential elections. Key developments include:\n\u00b7\nPYX's local subsidiaries, PT Investasi Mandiri and Tisma, received formal notification from the Provincial Department of Energy and Mineral Resources that their RKAB (Work Plan and Budget) approvals for production operations have been suspended. This action applies to all zircon producers in Central Kalimantan. Fourteen (14) companies were notified.\n\u00b7\nAs a result, PYX's export licenses for zircon, ilmenite, and rutile have also been suspended.\n\u00b7\nPT Investasi Mandiri has received tax assessments amounting to approximately USD2 million, which are being challenged through appropriate legal channels, with several matters already submitted to the courts.\nTo PYX's knowledge, all mineral sands producers in Central Kalimantan have suspended operations pending resolution of licensing matters.\nWhile PYX is not the subject of any specific allegations, the Company is committed to full cooperation with any investigation by the relevant authorities and supports efforts to ensure regulatory compliance across the sector.\nPYX has welcomed site visits and audits by relevant authorities and has received verbal assurances that its RKAB may be reinstated upon submission of supporting documentation.\nDespite the absence of production in H1 2025, PYX continues to manage its inventory and sales strategy prudently and remains focused on preserving shareholder value.\nPYX's Chairman and CEO Oliver Hasler commented: \"PYX continues to believe in the long-term potential of the mineral sands sector. However, we are currently facing a number of complex regulatory and administrative challenges in Indonesia, including a steep increase in royalties, that need to be resolved before we can move forward with our project. We are engaging constructively with the relevant authorities and remain committed to working through these hurdles in a responsible and transparent manner.\"\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments and provide further updates as appropriate\n.\n*** ENDS\n***\nFor more information:\nPYX Resources Limited\nT: +61 2 8823 3132\nE:\nir@pyxresources.com\nZeus (Broker)\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Darshan Patel\nT: +44 (0)20 3 829 5000\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Oliver B.
