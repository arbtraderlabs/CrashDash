The first half of the year was marked by an unprecedented regulatory shift in Indonesia that temporarily halted production and exports across the mineral sands sector and other industries.\nOperational and Regulatory Context\nDuring the first half, PYX's local subsidiaries, PT Investasi Mandiri and Tisma, received formal notification from the Provincial Department of Energy and Mineral Resources that their RKAB\n[2]\n(Work Plan and Budget) licenses for production operations have been suspended. This action applies to all zircon producers in Central Kalimantan. Fourteen (14) companies were notified. As a result, PYX's export licenses for zircon, ilmenite, and rutile have also been suspended. According to government statements, the move is driven by the need to address oversupply, improve market stability, and enhance regulatory oversight across multiple sectors - including coal, bauxite, nickel, and mineral sands, as well as palm oil and other commodities.\nIn the first half of 2025, PYX did not undertake production activities. This decision was made in response to continued weakness in global mineral sands pricing; elevated operating costs, particularly from third-party contract mining arrangements; and a steep increase in regional royalties from approx. US$19 per tonne to US$59 per tonne, as announced by PYX on 28 February 2025. Compounding the disruption, PYX also received tax assessments totalling approximately US$2 million, which are currently under legal challenge.\nThe Company confirms that its IUP license for the Mandiri deposit expired on 31 August 2025. Due to the current regulatory uncertainty, PYX has postponed the renewal of its license, resulting in a temporary suspension of operations at Mandiri. This development has had a direct and material impact on the Company's production and commercial activities.\nAs a result of these external factors, PYX recorded disappointing performance for the period, and management has prioritized cost control and strategic mitigation efforts.\nFinancial Performance\nDue to the suspension of operations and exports, PYX did not generate revenue during the first half of 2025. Nevertheless, the Company maintained its cash reserves and avoided incurring additional debts.\nHY 2025\nHY2024\n% change\nZircon Produced\n-\n4.5kt\n-100%\nZircon Sales\n-\n4.5kt\n-100%\nTotal Mineral Sands Produced\n-\n5.7kt\n-100%\nTotal Mineral Sands Sold\n1.0kt\n9.5kt\n-89%\nUS$\nHY 2025\nHY 2024\n% change\nSales revenue\n256,094\n8,830,830\n-97%\nCash cost of production\n(379,670)\n(6,404,685)\n94%\nEBITDA\n(520,560)\n22,824\n-2381%\nEBIT\n(424,937)\n(128,255)\n-231%\nNet loss before tax\n(625,379)\n(136,124)\n-359%\nNet loss after tax (NLAT)\n(625,379)\n(136,124)\n-359%\nUnderlying EBITDA\n(756,115)\n731,996\n-203%\nUS$\nAt 30 Jun 2025\nAt 30 Jun 2024\n% change\nCash\n5,052,892\n7,569,323\n-33%\nTotal assets\n87,729,772\n98,836,428\n-11%\nTotal liabilities\n(9,904,830)\n(15,157,815)\n35%\nIn light of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty and operational suspension in Indonesia, PYX Resources has taken decisive steps to safeguard its financial position. Preserving cash remains paramount, and the Company has implemented strict cost controls while maintaining operational readiness across its sites. Management continues to explore strategic fundraising options to ensure liquidity and support future growth initiatives. These measures are essential to navigating the current environment and positioning PYX for a swift recovery once regulatory clarity is restored.\nPYX's Chairman and CEO Oliver Hasler commented:\n\"PYX continues to believe in the long-term potential of the mineral sands sector. However, we are currently facing a number of complex regulatory and administrative challenges in Indonesia, including a steep increase in royalties, that need to be resolved before we can move forward with our project. The short-term market conditions are also affecting the general industry. I am proud about the strong support of the management to drastically adapt our cost structure to the actual difficult conditions.\"\nIndonesia's Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) has announced that the government will return to issuing RKAB starting in 2026.\n[3]\n*** ENDS ***\nFor more information:\nPYX Resources Limited\nT: +61 2 8823 3132\nE:\nir@pyxresources.com\nZeus (Broker)\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Darshan Patel\nT: +44 (0)20 3 829 5000\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Oliver B.

policies\na. Basis of Preparation\nThese general purpose interim financial statements for half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2025\nhave been prepared in accordance with requirements of the\nCorporations Act 2001\nand Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134:\nInterim Financial Reporting\n. The Group is a for-profit entity for financial reporting purposes under Australian Accounting Standards.\nThis interim financial report is intended to provide users with an update on the latest annual financial statements of Pyx Resources Limited and its controlled entities (referred to as the\n\"\nConsolidated Group\n\"\nor\n\"\nGroup\n\"\n). As such, it does not contain information that represents relatively insignificant changes occurring during the half-year within the Group. It is therefore recommended that this financial report be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the group for the year ended\n31\nDecember\n2024\n, together with any public announcements made during the following half-year.\nThese interim financial statements were authorised for issue on\n11\nSeptember\n2025\n.\nb. Going Concern\nThe financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue in operation for the foreseeable future.\nThe Group has recorded a net loss of $732,308 (2024: $136,124), reported cash used in operating activities $174,355 (2024: $1,191,202) and as of 30 June 2025 cash and cash equivalents of $5,052,892 (2024: $5,008,389). The net assets of the Group as at 30 June 2025 were $77,824,942 (2024: $78,463,200) with a net current liability position of $3,443,988 (2024: $3,070,646).\nThe directors have prepared a cash flow forecast for the period ending 30 September 2026. It is recognised that additional funding is required from shareholder loans for the Group to continue to actively explore its mineral properties and continue mining operations.\nThe directors have reviewed the business outlook and the assets and liabilities of the Group and are of the opinion that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate. The following factors have been taken into consideration by the directors:\n\u2022 The shareholders have continued to provide funding for the daily operations of the Group to the date of these financial statements;\n\u2022 The shareholder Edelweiss Partners Limited has indicated that they will not recall the loan amount of $3,000,000 as at the balance date until there is sufficient cash for the Group to pay back its debt; and,\n\u2022 The shareholder Edelweiss Partners Limited has also indicated that they will continue to support the Group through short-term cash borrowings whenever required for the period of 12 months from the date of this financial report.\nThe Group acknowledge that the status of going concern relies on the ongoing support of the shareholder Edelweiss Partners Limited and development of the Group's projects. Should the Group be unable to raise further debt be unable to continue to support the Group, there exists a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe financial report does not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts nor to the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern\nc. Accounting Policies\nThe same accounting policies and methods of computation have been followed in this interim financial report as were applied in the most recent annual financial statements\n.\nThe group has considered the implications of new or amended Accounting Standards, but determined that their application to the financial statements is either not relevant or not material.\ni) Fair Value Measurement\nWhen an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.\nFair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, are used, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into three levels, using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.

According to government statements, the move is driven by the need to address oversupply, improve market stability, and enhance regulatory oversight across multiple mining sectors-including coal, bauxite, nickel, and mineral sands.\n[1]\nThe Company confirms that its IUP license for the Mandiri deposit expired on 31 August 2025. Due to the current regulatory uncertainty,\nPYX is forced to postpone the renewal of its license\n, resulting in a temporary suspension of operations at Mandiri. This development has had a direct and material impact on the Company's production and commercial activities.\nWhile PYX supports the government's broader objectives to strengthen governance and transparency, the abrupt nature of the policy shift has created significant uncertainty for mining operators. The lack of a clear transitional framework has left companies like PYX unable to proceed with license renewals, despite a long-standing commitment to responsible mining.\nAccording to FerroAlloyNet, the new RKAB framework has \"aroused suspicion in the industry,\" with experts warning that the shift to annual approvals could destabilize production planning and overwhelm regulatory systems. Singgih Widagdo, Chairman of the Indonesian Mining & Energy Forum (IMEF), emphasized that Indonesia's 4,100+ active mining permits would be difficult to manage under a yearly approval cycle. He argued that the previous three-year RKAB system allowed for more realistic production targets and long-term planning, citing coal output projections of 922.16 million tons for 2024 as an example.\n[2]\nPYX remains committed to its long-term strategy of consolidating mineral sands resources.\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments and provide further updates as appropriate\n*** ENDS\n***\nFor more information:\nPYX Resources Limited\nT: +61 2 8823 3132\nE:\nir@pyxresources.com\nZeus (Broker)\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Darshan Patel\nT: +44 (0)20 3 829 5000\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Oliver B.

PYX's key deposits, Mandiri and Tisma, are large-scale, near-surface open pit deposits both located in the alluvium-rich region of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. PYX, whose Mandiri deposit has been in production since 2015, is the 3rd largest publicly traded producing mineral sands company by zircon resources globally. Determined to mine responsibly and invest in the wider communities where we operate, PYX is committed to fully developing its Mandiri and Tisma deposits, with the vision to consolidate the mineral sands resources in Kalimantan and explore and acquire mineral sands assets in Asia and beyond.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING\nINFORMATION\nThis Announcement contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Australian and UK securities laws, which are based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the date of this Announcement.\nThis forward-looking information includes, or may be based upon, without limitation, estimates, forecasts and statements as to management's expectations with respect to, among other things, the timing and amount of funding required to execute the Company's exploration, development and business plans, capital and exploration expenditures, the effect on the Company of any changes to existing legislation or policy, government regulation of mining operations, the length of time required to obtain permits, certifications and approvals, the success of exploration, development and mining activities, the geology of the Company's properties, environmental risks, the availability of labour, the focus of the Company in the future, demand and market outlook for precious metals and the prices thereof, progress in development of mineral properties, the Company's ability to raise funding privately or on a public market in the future, the Company's future growth, results of operations, performance, and business prospects and opportunities.

However, the second half was impacted by adverse weather, infrastructure disruptions, and declining mineral sands prices, resulting in reduced production and lower average realised prices.\nIn the first half of 2025, PYX did not undertake production activities. This decision was made in response to:\n\u00b7\nContinued weakness in global mineral sands pricing;\n\u00b7\nElevated operating costs, particularly from third-party contract mining arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nA steep increase in regional royalties from approx. US$8 per tonne to US$59 per tonne, as announced by PYX on 28 February 2025.\nIn addition, PYX has been navigating a complex regulatory environment in Indonesia following the recent presidential elections. Key developments include:\n\u00b7\nPYX's local subsidiaries, PT Investasi Mandiri and Tisma, received formal notification from the Provincial Department of Energy and Mineral Resources that their RKAB (Work Plan and Budget) approvals for production operations have been suspended. This action applies to all zircon producers in Central Kalimantan. Fourteen (14) companies were notified.\n\u00b7\nAs a result, PYX's export licenses for zircon, ilmenite, and rutile have also been suspended.\n\u00b7\nPT Investasi Mandiri has received tax assessments amounting to approximately USD2 million, which are being challenged through appropriate legal channels, with several matters already submitted to the courts.\nTo PYX's knowledge, all mineral sands producers in Central Kalimantan have suspended operations pending resolution of licensing matters.\nWhile PYX is not the subject of any specific allegations, the Company is committed to full cooperation with any investigation by the relevant authorities and supports efforts to ensure regulatory compliance across the sector.\nPYX has welcomed site visits and audits by relevant authorities and has received verbal assurances that its RKAB may be reinstated upon submission of supporting documentation.\nDespite the absence of production in H1 2025, PYX continues to manage its inventory and sales strategy prudently and remains focused on preserving shareholder value.\nPYX's Chairman and CEO Oliver Hasler commented: \"PYX continues to believe in the long-term potential of the mineral sands sector. However, we are currently facing a number of complex regulatory and administrative challenges in Indonesia, including a steep increase in royalties, that need to be resolved before we can move forward with our project. We are engaging constructively with the relevant authorities and remain committed to working through these hurdles in a responsible and transparent manner.\"\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments and provide further updates as appropriate\n.\n*** ENDS\n***\nFor more information:\nPYX Resources Limited\nT: +61 2 8823 3132\nE:\nir@pyxresources.com\nZeus (Broker)\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Darshan Patel\nT: +44 (0)20 3 829 5000\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Oliver B.
