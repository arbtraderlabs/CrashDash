UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\n31 December 2025\nDIGITAL 9 INFRASTRUCTURE PLC\n(\"D9\" or the \"Company\" and, together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\")\nCompletion of Aqua Comms sale\nand proposed return of capital to shareholders\nThe Board of D9 (the \"Board\") announces the completion of the divestment of its Atlantic and Irish Sea subsea fibre business, Aqua Comms (the \"Transaction\"), for a final net consideration of \u00a334.0 million1. Completion follows the satisfaction of all closing conditions under the sale and purchase agreement.\nThe final net consideration is \u00a31.6 million higher than the \u00a332.4 million valuation of Aqua Comms reported in the Company's 30 June 2025 interim report. As disclosed in the interim report, the June 2025 valuation of Aqua Comms reflected the update of the completion account mechanism as well as revised USD/GBP foreign exchange rate at that date.\nThe Board intends to return proceeds, net of anticipated future working capital needs (being approximately\u00a0a third of the proceeds), to shareholders by way of a pro\u2011rata compulsory capital redemption, which is expected to facilitate the most efficient and cost-effective return of the proceeds to shareholders.\nFuture working capital needs include the necessary ongoing operational cost commitments through to the final wind down of the Company, following future anticipated sale processes for Elio Networks and Arqiva. These processes are expected to occur over the coming years to maximise value for D9's shareholders in line with the previously communicated realisation plan for the Company. Maintaining an adequate working capital reserve will assist the Company in managing and optimise exit timing, while providing a measure of liquidity for any potential unforeseen operational expenses over the coming years. The Company will continue to monitor its working capital needs and will accelerate realisation plans and further capital redemptions when appropriate.\nThe Company will provide further details on the capital redemption scheme in due course.\n1\nGBP amounts as per the final 1.3527 USD/GBP exchange rate traded on 30 December 2025.\nENDS.\nNotes to Editors\nCapitalised terms used but not defined in this announcement shall have the same meaning as given in prior announcements of the Company.\nContacts\nDigital 9 Infrastructure plc\nEric Sanderson\nvia FTI Consulting\nInfraRed Capital Partners Limited\nJames O'Halloran\nMohammed Zaheer\n+44 (0) 207 484 1751\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Financial Adviser to the Company)\nChris Clarke\nDarren Vickers\n+44 (0) 203 100 2222\nJ.P.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\n26 November\n2025\nDIGITAL 9 INFRASTRUCTURE PLC\n(\"D9\" or the \"Company\" and, together with its subsidiaries, the \"Group\")\nPortfolio Update\nThe Company has received a pre-emption notice stating that certain minority shareholders of Arqiva Group (\"Arqiva\") representing a 26.5% aggregate stake held by Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II (\"MEIF II\") and other Macquarie-managed vehicles (together \"Macquarie\"), have agreed to the sale of their interests in Arqiva for a consideration of \u00a316.5m.\nMEIF II, launched in 2006, is now seven years beyond its maturity date. A liquidating trustee was appointed to MEIF II in 2022 and the sale of its minority interests in Arqiva now enables the dissolution of MEIF II.\nArqiva is the sole provider of national terrestrial TV and radio broadcasting infrastructure in the UK and has been an early and leading participant in the development of smart utility infrastructure in the UK through its smart water and energy metering services. It is also a leading provider of satellite uplink infrastructure and distribution services in the UK.\nArqiva Valuation\nThe Company's 51.8% interest in Arqiva represented approximately 75% of the Company's adjusted Gross Asset Value as of 30 June 2025, based on an investment valuation of \u00a3213.2 million, net of the Vendor Loan Note (\"VLN\"). The sale of Macquarie's interests is clearly priced well below the value of the Company's VLN.\nArqiva derives a large portion of its income from transmission services provided to UK public sector broadcasters under contracts which expire from 2030. As previously disclosed, the Company's valuation base case for Arqiva is determined by and highly sensitive to achieving a reasonable outcome on several material factors, including:\n\u00b7\nThe Department for Culture Media & Sport (\"DCMS\") policy consultation on the future of TV distribution by the end of 2027;\n\u00b7\nBroadcasting contract renewals for longer term extensions; and,\n\u00b7\nThe refinancing of Arqiva's capital structure.\nThe Investment Manager, InfraRed Capital Partners will carry out the 31 December 2025 valuation for the portfolio including Arqiva, in the ordinary course.\nThis year-end valuation will be independently reviewed by a third-party expert, and the financial statements will be audited.\nD9 is mandated to execute a managed wind-down aimed at maximising shareholder value through the orderly realisation of remaining portfolio companies. As such,\nthe Board and InfraRed continues to judge that pursuing a divestment of its stake in Arqiva prior to the resolution of the key contractual and financing decisions noted above would be premature as it would not result in an acceptable outcome for realising shareholder value.\nENDS.\nContacts\nDigital 9 Infrastructure plc\nEric San\nde\nrson\nvia FTI Consulting\nInfraRed Capital Partners Limited\nJames O'Halloran\nMohammed Zaheer\n+44 (0) 207 484 1751\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Financial Adviser to the Company)\nChris Clarke\nDarren Vickers\n+44 (0) 203 100 2222\nJ.P.

The Board and Investment Manager continue to seek opportunities to maximise value for shareholders.\"\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nStrong progress made towards the wind-down of the Company with the disposal of SeaEdge UK1 in June (\u00a310.3 million net consideration), the completion of the EMIC-1 divestment in May ($43.0 million net consideration) and the announcement of the Aqua Comms divestment in January ($44.5 million net consideration including completion account adjustments and adverse foreign exchange movements as of June 2025).\n\u00b7\nFull repayment of the Group's Revolving Credit Facility (\"RCF\"), which stood at \u00a353 million as of December 2024, using divestment proceeds from SeaEdge UK1 and EMIC-1 alongside working capital surpluses in June 2025.\n\u00b7\nFirst capital returns to shareholders expected in early 2026, following the expected completion of the Aqua Comms divestment which remains subject to multi-jurisdictional regulatory approvals. The quantum of capital returns is subject to final Aqua Comms proceeds and the Company's future working capital requirements.\n\u00b7\nThe Prior Year Adjustment (\"PYA\") Review, which was announced in the 31 December 2024 annual results, was concluded by the independent expert in the period. This has resulted in a downwards adjustment to the 31 December 2023 valuation of \u00a3111.5 million.\n\u00b7\nRobust operational performance from remaining operating assets Elio Networks and Arqiva in the first half of 2025. We continue to expect sale processes for these assets to commence in 2027 to maximise potential value for D9's shareholders.\n\u00b7\nNet Asset Value (\"NAV\") of \u00a3283.1 million (or 32.7 pence per share) as of 30 June 2025, compared with \u00a3297.3 million (34.4 pence per share) as of 31 December 2024.\n\u00b7\nThe 1.7p decline in the NAV of the Company over the last six months was primarily driven by a 0.7p fair value movement in Aqua Comms due to updates to the completion accounts and adverse foreign exchange movements, 0.5p due to the write-down of Verne Global Earn-Out to \u00a3Nil, and other fund operating costs in the D9 Group, offset by 0.4p business plan out-performance at Elio Networks.\n\u00b7\nAggregate revenues for the Investee Companies during the period amounted to \u00a3379 million, 6% higher than the same six-month period to 30 June 2024 (\u00a3357 million). The increase was largely attributable to the ramping up of water metering contracts at Arqiva.\n\u00b7\nEBITDA over the period decreased by 3% to \u00a3166 million, mainly due to a changing business mix at Arqiva.\nAs at\n30 June 2025\n31 December 2024\n30 June 2024\nIFRS NAV\n\u00a3283m\n\u00a3297m\n\u00a3403m\nIFRS NAV per share\n32.7p\n34.4p\n46.6p\nIFRS Investment Valuation\n\u00a3279m\n\u00a3286m\n\u00a3384m\nTotal Portfolio Value1\n\u00a3280m\n\u00a3331m\n\u00a3424m\nAggregate Group debt1\n\u00a3191m\n\u00a3238m\n\u00a3233m\nGroup Cash (unrestricted)1\n\u00a34.0m\n\u00a317.7m\n\u00a323.9m\nFor the period\nSix months to\n30 June 2025\nTwelve months to\n31 December 2024\nSix months to\n30 June 2024 (Restated)\nEarnings per share\n(1.7p)\n(45.0p)\n(19.8p)\nOngoing Charges Ratio (annualised)1\n1.90%\n1.82%\n1.63%\nDividends paid per share\n-\n-\n-\nTotal return (based on NAV)1\n(4.7%)\n(48.3%)\n(29.8%)\n1\nAlternative Performance Measure (\"APM\").

SeaEdge is a sub-lease of a data centre and subsea fibre landing station, located on a data centre campus in Newcastle, at which Stellium operates.\nThe \u00a310.7m consideration for SeaEdge includes the payment of deferred rent and is broadly in line with the 31 December 2024 net asset value of the investment together with the associated rent receivable at that date. The sale concludes the realisation process outlined to the market in the latest annual report and results presentation and follows a competitive process with several third-party bidders. The net proceeds are \u00a310.3m after the deduction of transaction and related costs, which the Company will use along with further working capital surpluses, to imminently repay and cancel the Revolving Credit Facility (\"RCF\") balance of c. \u00a313million in full. This concludes the fund deleveraging process initiated in 2024, which followed the completed divestment of Verne Global (15 March 2024) and EMIC-1 (28 May 2025).\nThe Board and Investment Manager will continue executing the orderly managed wind down of the Company, prioritising the return of capital to shareholders from remaining portfolio company divestments and maximising the value of such investments whilst they are owned or part-owned by the Company.\nENDS.\nContacts\nDigital 9 Infrastructure plc\nEric San\nde\nrson\nvia FTI Consulting\nInfraRed Capital Partners Limited\nJames O'Halloran\nMohammed Zaheer\n+44 (0) 207 484 1751\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Financial Adviser to the Company)\nChris Clarke\nDarren Vickers\n+44 (0) 203 100 2222\nJ.P.
