Although the terms of the disposal are not yet finalised, the Company confirms that the indicated price is \u00a3123.0 million for approximately 700 of the Company's 853 properties. The remaining properties in the Company's portfolio were valued at \u00a318.25 million in the draft valuation report prepared by Jones Lang LaSalle as at 31 August 2025.\nWhile discussions are ongoing with Patron Capital, there can be no certainty that a transaction will be agreed upon or as to the final terms of any such agreement, and this update should not be construed as announcing a transaction.\nThe Board is committed to maximising value for shareholders and will provide a further update when appropriate.

The valuation for the period ended 28 February 2025 is also presented for comparison purposes.\n31 August 2025\n28 February 2025\nNumber of properties\n853\n860\nPortfolio valuation\n\u00a3155.7m\n\u00a3169.0m\nIn line with the JLL valuation as at 28 February 2025, the majority of the portfolio (70% by number of properties) has been valued on a vacant possession basis, with the remainder at investment value, and on an individual property basis. The reduction in the property valuation is principally a result of adjustments to the basis of valuation for properties held at investment value. This has resulted in a reduction to the cap of vacant possession value at which these properties with leases are held (126% of MV-VP versus 154% of MV-VP previously). Further, JLL applied a discount to vacant possession value for supported living properties which are not on a direct lease. The overall valuation has also decreased due to specific factors for individual properties.\nThe valuation has been prepared in accordance with the current Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' Valuation - Global Standards, effective from January 2025, incorporating the IVS and the current UK national supplement. The valuation in the table is unaudited and may be subject to amendment as part of the completion of the formal audit process for the year ended 31 August 2025.\nHistoric Accounts Update\nT\nhe unaudited interim accounts for the periods ending 28 February 2024 and 28 February 2025 are expected to be published by the end of 2025. The process for the audit and\npublication of the Company's annual results for the period ending 31 August 2025 has commenced, with the results expected to be published in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe Board and AEW remain committed to the restoration of trading in the Company's ordinary shares as soon as practicable.\nFinancial Position Update\nAt the period ended 31 August 2025, the Company had\u00a0\u00a39.6m\u00a0of cash. The Company's cash together with rental income are expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's operational expenses and fees during the managed wind-down and for the next twelve months.\nPortfolio Sale Update\nAfter an extensive marketing campaign commenced in Q4 2024, non-binding offers were received for the full portfolio in February 2025 and due diligence is progressing. The Company anticipates that the portfolio sale process will conclude in the fourth quarter of 2025. However, there is no assurance that the portfolio sale will progress under the current expected timeline or with terms which are acceptable to the Board. AEW continues to undertake asset management initiatives focused on adding value to the portfolio and preparing them for sale.\nLitigation\nThere have been no material changes with regards to the potential shareholder group litigation, the FCA investigation, or the Company's pursuit of legal action.
