The Facility, of up to \u00a31,000,000, has a term of 3 years, and each drawdown of the debt has a term of 12 months.\nThe Company will use the gross proceeds of the drawdown to fund working capital and to continue the development of its portfolio and progress the transaction with Central Petroleum.\nWestmarket Oil & Gas, the operational subsidiary of the Company is fully funded having recently agreed a structured offtake finance arrangement with Harlequin Energy.\nDebt Facility\nThe First Drawdown of \u00a3300,000 occurred on 4th November 2025 and is convertible at 8 pence per share (\"Reference Price\") and each drawdown thereafter at a 50% premium to the 5-day VWAP preceding the drawdown. There is no interest to be applied to the loan.\nThe Company has now undertaken a Second Drawdown of \u00a3500,000 on the same terms as that agreed for the First Drawdown, that being convertible at a\npremium of 8.00 pence\n.\nIssue of Warrants\nThe Investor shall receive Warrants equal to 40% of each drawdown divided by the Reference Price, exercisable at a 50% premium to the relevant Reference Price being 8.00 pence (2.5 million warrants). Each issuance of Warrants will have a 48-month term from the date of issuance (which may be offset against outstanding debt if exercised). As with the First Drawdown, the Second Drawdown warrants will be exercisable at 8 pence.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"We are delighted to have received the continued support from an Institutional Investor. This strategic investment not only strengthens our balance sheet but also underscores institutional confidence in our vision and asset base. The funding provides us with the flexibility to accelerate the advancement of our key projects and evaluate additional growth opportunities to deliver enhanced shareholder value.\"\nEND\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliver Stansfield\nOak Securities - Joint Broker\nJerry Keen\n+44 (0)203 973 3678\nHenry Clarke\nDillon Anadkat\nFinancial PR via\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nViolet Wilson\n+44 (0)203 757 4980\nTamsin Howard\nNotes to Editors\nGeorgina Energy aims to become a leading player in the global energy market and is focused on establishing itself among the top producers of helium and hydrogen worldwide.

The Company has undertaken due diligence and been provided with Harlequin's\nUSD$25 million\nstructured offtake funding facility to finance Georgina's drilling program.\nHUSSAR EP513:\nHarlequin has engaged\nSchlumberger Oilfield UK Limited to work in conjunction with\nGeorgina's technical consultants (Aztech Well Construction) to proceed with the planning, engineering and drilling of an exploration well at Hussar. Harlequin will fund the Hussar drill program in a structured offtake financing arrangement.\nThe drilling program and site infrastructure works required to develop Hussar into a producing asset will be funded solely by Harlequin and their partners in a structured offtake funding arrangement that is non-dilutive for Georgina shareholders.\nThe structured offtake funding arrangement is Georgina's preferred approach to financing future drilling, as it enables gas sales at the wellhead while avoiding significant capital outlay by the Company, thus making it a non-dilutive solution for shareholders.\nDrilling Program\nGeorgina's technical consultant, Aztech Well Construction have identified four drill rigs available in Australia that meet the required specifications for the 50-day drilling program.\n\u00b7\nENSIGN RIG 974\n\u00b7\nMINRES EXPLORER RIG\n\u00b7\nSAVANNA SLR RIG 186 (V4)\n\u00b7\nVENTIA RIG 106 IDEAL PRIME\nFollowing an extensive consultation process with Harlequin and Georgina's technical team to agree the timeline and technical aspects of activity, the Drilling Program broadly comprises the following:\nCompletion Date(Calendar 2026)\nActivity\nQ1\nOrder long lead items such as wellhead/casing\nTender & contract drilling rig.

Halo is backed by established capital from family office and fund investors supporting companies in highly regulated energy markets.\nOFFTAKE MOU:\nThe agreement grants Halo the non-exclusive option to 100% of helium, hydrogen and natural gas output from Georgina's current and any future projects.\nThe agreement will provide Westmarket Oil & Gas with the option to sell the gas at the well head in its raw state via Offtake funding. This is subject to a formal contract on commercial terms which will minimise the Company's exposure to expensive capital infrastructure. The extension of the MOU does not affect the ongoing funding discussions regarding Hussar and Mt Winter, which remain priorities.\nKey highlights:\n\u00b7\nThe Off-taker will be responsible for the processing facilities, including separation units for helium/ hydrogen and cryogenic systems purification at its sole cost.\n\u00b7\nGeorgina's sunk costs will be recovered subject to an agreement between the parties.\n\u00b7\nPrepayment financing and optional funding to accelerate development will be available, subject to agreed terms.\n\u00b7\nStorage, transportation, exportation and trucking helium to Darwin, and ammonia conversion to hydrogen, will be the Off-taker's sole responsibility.\nWestmarket Oil & Gas must deliver completed flow tests identifying volumes and composition of the gas reserves.\nThe Off-taker will then conduct a detailed review and assessment to agree commercial terms. The agreement will only become exclusive when the Off-taker provides proof of funds and executes a formal contract.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"While the development, financing and drilling of Hussar and Mt Winter remain our priorities, the extension of the Off-take MOU will allow Halo to consider the transformational and highly complementary CTP projects as part of the Offtake agreement. The incorporation of the Mt Kitty, Dukas and Mahler assets supports its sell at the well head concept.\n\"Georgina Energy has built forward momentum with the approval of the Hussar EP513 drilling permit, completion of the purchase of 100% of Mt Winter along with the new CTP wells, subject to completion, positioning the Company to become a leading producer of helium and hydrogen.

The Company continues to prepare logistics for repairs at the airstrip, access roads, planning of the drill pad and site locations for the drilling rig and crew along with other critical elements of operational planning.\nMT Winter EP155:\nThe Company has been advised by its indigenous consultant of continued progress for the release of the ALRA agreement from the Central Land Council (\"CLC\"), which will facilitate completion of the 100% acquisition. Planning remains well advanced with the prospect re-entry program having been submitted. The Company is also in discussions with multiple parties to provide funding for the re-entry under an offtake funding agreement.\nCentral Petroleum Acquisition:\nThe Company is working with its advisers to prepare the Prospectus for approval by the FCA. The three advanced re-entry projects Mt Kitty, Dukas and Magee/Mahler are complementary to Georgina's existing current Mt Winter and Hussar assets. Mt Kitty in particular flowed to surface 500,000 standard cubic feet per day (SCFGD) with a significant concentration of 9% Helium and 11% Hydrogen, including the presence of \"3He\" (Helium Isotope 3). The planned re-entry and 500 metre horizontal section at Mt Kitty is expected to significantly increase both the previous flow rate and Contingent Resources, which would require a valid path in order to convert into Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"Georgina continues to negotiate with its off-take partners to provide funding to develop both Hussar and Mt Winter, alongside advancing the potential acquisition of Mt Kitty, Dukas and Magee from Central Petroleum. In particular, we are excited by the potential that Mt Kitty offers as it could provide significant reserves to the portfolio.

        "Listing events: Trading was suspended on 2nd June 2025, with no subsequent relisting or market\u2011access plan announced. The company has not filed any new PDMR or listing\u2011related documents since.",

        "Operational update: The latest press releases in July and August 2025 describe permit updates, a 37.8% resource upgrade for Mt Winter, and progress on Helium\u20113 potential, but they stop short of providing any cost\u2011benefit or revenue projections."

      "timing_regime": "According to APEX, the setup is in the Late phase \u2013 the story has been on the market for a while with little movement, so entry timing is uncertain and the window for a meaningful move is narrow.",
