Halo is backed by established capital from family office and fund investors supporting companies in highly regulated energy markets.\nOFFTAKE MOU:\nThe agreement grants Halo the non-exclusive option to 100% of helium, hydrogen and natural gas output from Georgina's current and any future projects.\nThe agreement will provide Westmarket Oil & Gas with the option to sell the gas at the well head in its raw state via Offtake funding. This is subject to a formal contract on commercial terms which will minimise the Company's exposure to expensive capital infrastructure. The extension of the MOU does not affect the ongoing funding discussions regarding Hussar and Mt Winter, which remain priorities.\nKey highlights:\n\u00b7\nThe Off-taker will be responsible for the processing facilities, including separation units for helium/ hydrogen and cryogenic systems purification at its sole cost.\n\u00b7\nGeorgina's sunk costs will be recovered subject to an agreement between the parties.\n\u00b7\nPrepayment financing and optional funding to accelerate development will be available, subject to agreed terms.\n\u00b7\nStorage, transportation, exportation and trucking helium to Darwin, and ammonia conversion to hydrogen, will be the Off-taker's sole responsibility.\nWestmarket Oil & Gas must deliver completed flow tests identifying volumes and composition of the gas reserves.\nThe Off-taker will then conduct a detailed review and assessment to agree commercial terms. The agreement will only become exclusive when the Off-taker provides proof of funds and executes a formal contract.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"While the development, financing and drilling of Hussar and Mt Winter remain our priorities, the extension of the Off-take MOU will allow Halo to consider the transformational and highly complementary CTP projects as part of the Offtake agreement. The incorporation of the Mt Kitty, Dukas and Mahler assets supports its sell at the well head concept.\n\"Georgina Energy has built forward momentum with the approval of the Hussar EP513 drilling permit, completion of the purchase of 100% of Mt Winter along with the new CTP wells, subject to completion, positioning the Company to become a leading producer of helium and hydrogen.
