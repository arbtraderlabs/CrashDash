Halo is backed by established capital from family office and fund investors supporting companies in highly regulated energy markets.\nOFFTAKE MOU:\nThe agreement grants Halo the non-exclusive option to 100% of helium, hydrogen and natural gas output from Georgina's current and any future projects.\nThe agreement will provide Westmarket Oil & Gas with the option to sell the gas at the well head in its raw state via Offtake funding. This is subject to a formal contract on commercial terms which will minimise the Company's exposure to expensive capital infrastructure. The extension of the MOU does not affect the ongoing funding discussions regarding Hussar and Mt Winter, which remain priorities.\nKey highlights:\n\u00b7\nThe Off-taker will be responsible for the processing facilities, including separation units for helium/ hydrogen and cryogenic systems purification at its sole cost.\n\u00b7\nGeorgina's sunk costs will be recovered subject to an agreement between the parties.\n\u00b7\nPrepayment financing and optional funding to accelerate development will be available, subject to agreed terms.\n\u00b7\nStorage, transportation, exportation and trucking helium to Darwin, and ammonia conversion to hydrogen, will be the Off-taker's sole responsibility.\nWestmarket Oil & Gas must deliver completed flow tests identifying volumes and composition of the gas reserves.\nThe Off-taker will then conduct a detailed review and assessment to agree commercial terms. The agreement will only become exclusive when the Off-taker provides proof of funds and executes a formal contract.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"While the development, financing and drilling of Hussar and Mt Winter remain our priorities, the extension of the Off-take MOU will allow Halo to consider the transformational and highly complementary CTP projects as part of the Offtake agreement. The incorporation of the Mt Kitty, Dukas and Mahler assets supports its sell at the well head concept.\n\"Georgina Energy has built forward momentum with the approval of the Hussar EP513 drilling permit, completion of the purchase of 100% of Mt Winter along with the new CTP wells, subject to completion, positioning the Company to become a leading producer of helium and hydrogen.

The Company continues to prepare logistics for repairs at the airstrip, access roads, planning of the drill pad and site locations for the drilling rig and crew along with other critical elements of operational planning.\nMT Winter EP155:\nThe Company has been advised by its indigenous consultant of continued progress for the release of the ALRA agreement from the Central Land Council (\"CLC\"), which will facilitate completion of the 100% acquisition. Planning remains well advanced with the prospect re-entry program having been submitted. The Company is also in discussions with multiple parties to provide funding for the re-entry under an offtake funding agreement.\nCentral Petroleum Acquisition:\nThe Company is working with its advisers to prepare the Prospectus for approval by the FCA. The three advanced re-entry projects Mt Kitty, Dukas and Magee/Mahler are complementary to Georgina's existing current Mt Winter and Hussar assets. Mt Kitty in particular flowed to surface 500,000 standard cubic feet per day (SCFGD) with a significant concentration of 9% Helium and 11% Hydrogen, including the presence of \"3He\" (Helium Isotope 3). The planned re-entry and 500 metre horizontal section at Mt Kitty is expected to significantly increase both the previous flow rate and Contingent Resources, which would require a valid path in order to convert into Proved, Probable and Possible Reserves.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"Georgina continues to negotiate with its off-take partners to provide funding to develop both Hussar and Mt Winter, alongside advancing the potential acquisition of Mt Kitty, Dukas and Magee from Central Petroleum. In particular, we are excited by the potential that Mt Kitty offers as it could provide significant reserves to the portfolio.

Other interests and assets held by these subsidiaries do not form part of the Acquisition and will be restructured to be remain under the ownership of the CTP group (the \"Restructure\").\nTransaction highlights and rationale\n\u00b7\nTransformative transaction\no\nPurchase of three companies which hold interests in three significant advanced exploration targets\no\nHighly complementary projects to Georgina's current portfolio\n\u00b7\nIncreased exposure to high value, strategically located re-entry targets\no\nTargets previously drilled and flowed to surface with high concentrations of helium, hydrogen and hydrocarbons\no\nAt least one well has a recorded presence of Helium Isotope 3 (\"\n3He\n\")\n\u00a7\nThe Amadeus Basin has recorded levels of\n3He\nup to 1,100 ppt\n[1]\n\u00b7\nTransaction details\no\nIn consideration, upon completion, Central Petroleum will hold 25% of Georgina's issued share capital\no\nSPA is conditional on:\n\u00a7\nMinisterial consent from the Northern Territory Department of Mining and Energy;\n\u00a7\nSantos' consent under the relevant JOAs to the change of ownership;\n\u00a7\nCompletion of CTP's Restructure;\n\u00a7\nGeorgina shareholder vote at a General Meeting;\n\u00a7\nFundraise of \u00a37 million; and\n\u00a7\nPublication of Prospectus to be approved by the FCA.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"We are delighted to sign a transformational transaction with Central Petroleum, which, if completed, would bring enormous upside for shareholders and longevity to our business. A naturally fractured reservoir, Mt Kitty (EP125) already has drilled 2C Contingent Resources, which the Company plans to convert to Proven and Probable Reserves, adding valuable production barrels and cash flow to Georgina's portfolio.\nWe're excited to explore Dukas, as a considered mega structure, as well as develop\nHussar and Mt Winter, as planned.\n\"This transaction takes Georgina to the next level in achieving our strategy to become a leading producer of helium and hydrogen and we look forward to working with both Central Petroleum and Santos to take these assets forward.\"\nInterest-holding subsidiaries that are the subject to the SPA are:\n\u00b7\nHelium Australia Pty - Mt Kitty/Jacko Bore (EP125)\n\u00b7\nFrontier Oil & Gas Pty Ltd - Dukas (EP112)\n\u00b7\nOrdiv Petroleum Pty Ltd - Mahler/ Magee (EP82)\nThe EPs are subject to existing joint operating agreements (JOAs) with Santos QNT Pty Ltd (Santos).\nLocation of Exploration Permits\nIn March 2025, Georgina commissioned an Independent Competent Person's Report (\"CPR\") on the three EPs, identifying Prospective (Dukas and Mahler) and Contingent (Mt Kitty) Resources. A copy of the CPR is available on Georgina's website:\nhttps://www.georginaenergy.com/investors/results-reports-presentations/\nAll three prospects are of significant scale and represent advanced re-entry prospects, with Dukas considered a mega-structure and potentially the largest identified helium, hydrogen and hydrocarbon prospect to date in Australia. The Company intends to convert these Resources to Proven and Probable Reserve status.\nThe EPs are all within proximity to the Company's existing assets in the Amadeus and Officer Basins where Georgina has focused its attention to date.\nThe plugged and suspended Mt Kitty well was previously drilled in 2014 to a relatively shallow depth of 2,295m TD and produced a flow of\n500,000 SCFGD\ngas to surface with exceptionally high concentrations of up to\n9% Helium and 11% Hydrogen\nas well as a significant proportion of hydrocarbon gases at 40%. However, the well intersected only a short vertical section of naturally fractured basement and did not encounter the targeted Heavitree Sandstone reservoir. The Company believes that the Heavitree play remains a potential flanking target, which may be intersected in a planned re-entry well incorporating a 500m horizontal section, to enhance flow from the naturally fractured basement.\nTransaction Details\nIn consideration for the",

The net proceeds of the Placing are to advance the ongoing work programmes in relation to Hussar and Mt Winter and for general working capital purposes.\nOperations at Hussar continue to advance with the Company having completed its initial site operations and reporting obligations to lodge a permit with the Western Australian Department of Mines, Petroleum and Exploration seeking drilling approval.\nSince listing on LSE in July 2024, the Company engaged a Geological Consultant to undertake a review of the Hussar and Mt Winter seismic data. The updated seismic mapping and reprocessing enabled a comprehensive review of the resource potential resulting in an overall increase of approximately 20% at Hussar and an increase in net attributable 2U Prospective (Recoverable) Resources of 15% of both Helium and Hydrogen at Mt Winter.\nGeorgina continues to negotiate with potential off-take parties, and we remain open to strategic partnerships that can accelerate our path to development while managing risk and capital exposure.\nGovernance and ESG Commitment\nWe are committed to high standards of corporate governance, transparency, and environmental responsibility. During the period, we began implementing frameworks that will support responsible operations as we transition from exploration to development.\nIn all our activities, we engage respectfully with local communities and stakeholders, ensuring that our presence brings shared value and long-term benefit to host regions.\nClosing Remarks\nWe are steadily building the foundations of a company capable of delivering long-term value in a low-carbon future. I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued belief in our vision, our partners for their collaboration, and our dedicated team for their resilience and commitment.\nPeter Bradley\nChairman\nOperations Review\nThe Company was successfully readmitted to the London Stock Exchange main market on 30 July 2024 with a capital raise of \u00a35.0 million in gross funds. The Company subsequently raised a further \u00a31,000,000 in August 2025 for further working capital. The funds have been applied to the advancement of the helium, hydrogen and natural gas assets held by the Company.\nGeorgina Energy has two projects; Hussar EP513 located in the Officer Basin of Western Australia and Mt Winter EPA155 located in the Amadeus Basin of Australia's Northern Territory.\nDuring the 12-month period to 31 July 2025 since re-listing the Company has made significant operational developments comprising:\n1. Final drilling approval for Hussar\nThe Company has submitted all required documentation to the Western Australian Department of Mines, Petroleum and Exploration (DMPE). The Company was formally notified on the 14 July approval of the Well Management Plan and in turn confirming approval of the exploration and recovery of Helium. On 22 October 2025, Georgina announced it had received formal Environmental Management Plan (\"EMP\") approval from DMPE to drill the Hussar Prospect in EP513. The company is currently awaiting final drill approval from (DMPE) which is anticipated to occur shortly.\n2. Drilling of the well target at Hussar\nSubject to the final drilling approval f",

The offtaker would be responsible for capital outlay for downstream processing facilities, including the separation units, PSA systems for helium/hydrogen separation and cryogenic systems for purification.\nImportantly, the off-taker has also indicated the availability of pre-pay financing to accelerate development. Negotiations are ongoing, and the Company will advise on any successful outcomes.\nHelium-3\npotential in the Amadeus Basin\nGeorgina's\ntwo major re-entry projects, Hussar in the Officer Basin (Western Australia) and Mt Winter in the Amadeus Basin (Northern Territory), are focused on the re-entry and testing of a combined independently assessed SPE PRMS 2U/ P50 Prospective Recoverable Resources of 430 BCF helium, 432 BCF hydrogen and 3,764 BCF of hydrocarbons (\nat 100% ownership level\n).\nIn response to recent investor queries regarding the potential presence of Helium-3 (\n\u00b3He\n) at Mt Winter and Hussar, the Company confirms that\nconsultants have previously identified drilled evidence of exceptionally high grades of helium (ranging up to 9% helium) in the subsalt zones of the Amadeus Basin. While this is predominantly the more common\nHelium-4\nisotope variation, previous reporting by the Australian Petroleum Producers Association (now the Australian Energy Producers) also documents the occurrence of the much rarer and highly valuable Helium-3 isotopic variation(\n\u00b3He)\n.\n\u00b3He\nis exceptionally rare and is thought to originate deep within the Earth's mantle, migrating up fault and fracture systems into crustal reservoirs where it can be found in trace amounts mixed with \u2074He.\nThe projected usage of \u00b3He includes nuclear fusion for clean energy, quantum computing, cryogenics, medical imaging, and nuclear monitoring. Due to its scarcity,\n\u00b3He\ncommands significantly higher prices compared to \u2074He, with Gold Hydrogen Limited (\"GHY\") quoting pricing in 2024 in excess of US$70 million/mcf-approximately 140,000 times the price of the \u2074He helium isotope.\nNotably, reported \u00b3He concentrations of up to 901 ppt (parts per trillion) in GHY's Ramsay-2 well in South Australia are considered significant. However, gas analyses from the Amadeus Basin show \u00b3He levels of up to 1,100 ppt, as reported by Dr Chris Boreham in\n\"Helium in the Australian Liquefied Gas Economy\" (APPEA Journal,\nJan 2018 p.219) - approximately 22% higher than the maximum concentrations reported in GHY's South Australian project.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"To be in receipt of further offtake interest adds strength our position as we continue to derisk Georgina's key projects. The terms of the proposed agreement are very encouraging and align with our scoping study recommendations and wellhead sales strategy.\nIn addition, the potential for high levels of Helium-3 reported by Australian Energy Producers in the Amadeus Basin underscores the strategic importance of our planned re-development programme and may represent an opportunity for further value creation, with the possibility of an additional income stream subject to the success of planned flow testing.\"\nEND\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliver Stansfield\nOak Securities - Joint Broker\nJerry Keen\n+44 (0)203 973 3678\nHenry Clarke\nDillon Anadkat\nFinancial PR via\ngeorginaenerg",

This agreement is necessary for the granting of the selected priority area of EPA155 by the Northern Territory Minister for the Department of Mining and Energy.\nImportantly, the CLC has found no major impediments to the drafting of the Mt Winter ALRA agreement, and the Company anticipates receiving the first draft shortly. Once finalised, the agreement will allow the Company to swiftly complete on the Share Purchase Agreement, thereby acquiring 100% ownership of the Mt Winter tenement from Mosman Oil & Gas.\nGeorgina has been informed that the ALRA agreement will be completed by the CLC following its current priority work on a new production agreement for the Mereenie Oil and Gas Field. The Mereenie Oil and Gas Field, located approximately 70 km east of the Mt Winter re-entry project, holds a rich history as the largest onshore oil and gas field in mainland Australia at the time of its discovery in 1964. Since commencing production in 1984, the field has consistently delivered, with over 17 million barrels of oil and around 280 billion cubic feet of gas produced to date.\nThe forthcoming ALRA agreement will also incorporate Mt Winter-1 and two additional historical wells drilled on EPA155, both under active review for their sequential re-entry potential. In parallel, recent reprocessing and re-mapping of the existing seismic data has significantly expanded the prospective resource target area within EPA155, resulting in a 38% increase in 2U/P50 recoverable resources.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"The Company remains confident in finalising the ALRA agreement, which will include the decision to accelerate the Mt Winter re-entry. While the new Mereenie production agreement has caused a brief delay, we continue to work in partnership with the CLC and the Traditional Owners to expedite an agreement and unlock the expanded potential of EPA155.\n\"Alongside this, following submission of our revised Environmental Management Plan also look forward to providing further updates regarding drilling permit approval at Hussar EP513\n\"\nEND\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliver Stansfield\nOak Securities - Joint Broker\nJerry Keen\n+44 (0)203 973 3678\nHenry Clarke\nDillon Anadkat\nFinancial PR via\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nViolet Wilson\n+44 (0)203 757 4980\nLetaba Rimell\nNotes to Editors\nGeorgina Energy aims to become a leading player in the global energy market and is focused on establishing itself among the top producers of helium and hydrogen worldwide.

The Company is confident the DMPE will issue the requested drilling approval in short order.\nThe process is a significant undertaking by all parties to ensure compliance and involves multiple submissions which are then reviewed by the relevant regulators with any additional information to be submitted on request.\nWhile this process has been lengthy, the ultimate outcome is access to the Hussar wellsite. The initial programme calls for the Company to undertake repairs at the Hussar Airstrip and access roads, and begin to construct drilling and camp location pads together with water wells in preparation for drilling.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"Georgina's operations team and consultants have worked closely in cooperation with indigenous community representatives over a considerable period to ensure all the required obligations for the\ngranting of the Hussar drilling approval are completed.\nWe appreciate our shareholders' patience in this process as it has been impacted by matters beyond our control such as unforeseen amendments, including an increased resource area, and a once in 80-year flooding weather event.\"\nEND\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliver Stansfield\nOak Securities - Joint Broker\nJerry Keen\n+44 (0)203 973 3678\nHenry Clarke\nDillon Anadkat\nFinancial PR via\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nViolet Wilson\n+44 (0)203 757 4980\nLetaba Rimell\nNotes to Editors\nGeorgina Energy aims to become a leading player in the global energy market and is focused on establishing itself among the top producers of helium and hydrogen worldwide.

Formation and the prognosed basement granodiorite.\nThe Resource estimates presented are unrisked and have been determined utilising the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) guidelines of 2018, with revisions in 2022.Standard PRMS terminology is utilised in this report, presenting Resource Estimates as low 1U (P90), 2U for best estimate (P50), and as 3U for high estimate (P10) of as-yet undiscovered volumes.\nGlobally, fracture porosity petroleum projects are very significant, the enormous Bach Ho petroleum field in Vietnam for example is hosted by fractured granodiorite basement similar to that prognosed at the Mt Winter prospect in the Amadeus basement.\nThe prospectivity of fractured porosity plays in the Amadeus Basin is further evidenced by the previously short, drilled section of the fractured basement at Mt Kitty-1 in the Amadeus basin which resulted in significant volumes of Helium (9%) and Hydrogen (11%) in 2014.\nGeneral Update\nThe Mt Winter EP155 ownership, originally at a projected 75%, was the subject of an RNS dated 22nd January 2025 which referred to an increase of Company ownership to 100% on settlement of a Share Purchase Agreement.\nIn addition to the planned re-entry of Mt Winter 1 two further wells were drilled at EPA155 which are currently being reviewed for their respective sequential re-entry potential. The Company continues to advance the re-entry program timeline following the execution of a previously announced agreement for acquisition of 100% of the Mt Winter tenement from Mosman Oil & Gas, which remains on track for completion.\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe information in this announcement relating to Resource Evaluation is based on information compiled by Mr. Maki Petkovski is a member of The American Association of Petroleum Geologists, The European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers, The Society of Petroleum Engineers, The Australian Society of Exploration Geophysicists and The Petroleum Exploration Society of Australia, and has sufficient experience of petroleum reserves and resources evaluation under consideration, and to the activity he is undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person.\nMr. Maki Petkovski consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"We are delighted with a 37.8% increase in recoverable resources at Mt Winter, as it further justifies our hard work in bringing the asset to a pre-drill stage. Our technical team has been working tirelessly to complete drilling permitting and tenement applications for the the well re-entry programs for both Hussar & Mt Winter. The increase (Helium, Hydrogen and natural gas) to the potentially recoverable resources in our Mt Winter asset is regarded as a major milestone in our program to re-develop low-risk Helium, Hydrogen and natural gas projects in Australia.\"\nEND\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Ene",

Well Management Plan (WMOG-DR-PL-02)\nii. Drilling Application (SOP-WLA-0193) and\niii.\nWell Activity Application (SOP-WLD-0109)\n.\nGeorgina has also received the Report of Archaeological and Ethnographic Work Program Survey completed within the revised EP513 Exploration permit area.\nPermit Status\nThe revised Environmental Impact Report which incorporates a significantly larger area, has been completed. Formal notice has been lodged with the Central Desert Native Title Services, as part of the drilling approval process for the intention to undertake repairs at the Hussar airstrip and access roads.\nThe Company is working closely with both DEMIRS and the Traditional Owners to secure drilling approval and remain confident it will be granted. Detailed engineering has taken place over the Hussar well re-entry and well development and a suitable drill rig, Ensign 970 Rig with a 10M BOP system, has been identified to undertake the drilling program.\nSeismic Reprocessing\nThe Company and its consultants, following completion of seismic reprocessing and remapping, have also identified a secondary target within the significant expansion of the Hussar structural closure of c.350 km2, an increase of 50 km2 in aerial extent than previously mapped and entirely within the EP513 exploration licence.\nEPA155 Mount Winter\nThe Company is currently preparing the preliminary re-entry work program as part of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act (\"ALRA\") agreement as the final part of the process to obtaining ratification of the granting of the selected priority area of EPA155 from the Northern Territory Minister for the Department of Mining and Energy.\nGeorgina has advanced the re-entry program timeline following the proposed acquisition of 100% of Mt Winter which is anticipated to complete in due course. The increased resource potential of the Mt Winter prospect following completion of reprocessing and re-mapping of the existing 2D seismic data has also provided an additional resource target within EPA155.\nAdditional Targets\nThe Company is progressing negotiations following the completion of a detailed review for potential advanced prospects with proven drilled occurrences of gas with high concentrations of helium, hydrogen and hydrocarbons under relevant Confidentiality Agreements. These potential targets are slated for re-entry and development following the completion of developments at Hussar and Mt Winter. The Company will advise on any substantive progress.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"Georgina continues to be focused on multiple workstreams to fulfil obligations for the Hussar drilling permit approval and completion of the Mt Winter acquisition along with implementing preparation of the re-entry plans for Mt Winter and completion of the ALRA agreement with the CLC and the Traditional Owners. Concurrently, we have completed the evaluation of additional re-entry targets which will shape our post-Hussar and Mt Winter work programme.\"\nEND\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliver Stansfield\nOak Securities - Joint Broker\nJerry Keen\n+44 (0)203 973 3678\nHenry Clarke\nDillon Anadkat\nFinancial PR via\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nViolet Wilson\n+44 (0)203 757 4980\nLetaba Rimell\nNotes to Editors\nGeorgina Energy aims to become a leading player in the global energy market and is focused on establishing itself among the top producers of helium and hydrogen worldwide.

The upgrade follows the successful completion of seismic data reprocessing and re-mapping from the Independent Competent Person, Mr Maki Petkovski. This addendum builds on the CPR of May 23, 2024, published by Al Maynard & Associates, released in the Company's Prospectus (available on the GEX website). The revised estimates take into account Georgina's assumed 75% working interest, based on the Company funding 100% of the planned Mt Winter-1 re-entry program.

Subject to Georgina funding 100% of the first re-entry well, these 75% net attributable resource may increase to a 90% interest resulting in potential net attributable 2U Prospective (Recoverable) Resources of 133 BCF Helium, (132 million MCF), 122 BCF (122 million MCF) of Hydrogen and 1.1 TCF natural gas.\nResource estimates presented are unrisked and have been determined utilising the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) 2018 and 2011 (Guideline) principals. Standard PRMS terminology is utilised in this report, presenting Resource Estimates as low 1U (P90), 2U for best estimate (P50), and as 3U for high estimate (P10) of as-yet undiscovered volumes.\nNew Closure Identified and Development Outlook\nIn addition, a large structural high of up to 60 km2 closure to the north-east of the Mt Winter-1 well and to the north of the existing Mt Winter Prospect has been identified and represents a significant additional potential closure as a future drilling candidate subject to further additional seismic.\nThe completion of the seismic reprocessing and re-mapping support the Company's planned re-entry at the Mt Winter-1 well, which was originally drilled in 1982 to a depth of 2,650m in the Gillen Salt. Georgina is now planning the re-entry and deepening of Mt Winter-1 to approximately 2,900m to test the targeted helium, hydrogen and natural gas potential in the subsalt Heavitree Formation reservoir.\nUpdate on Exploration Permit\nThe Company has executed the necessary Confidentiality Agreements and is currently negotiating the Aboriginal Land Rights Agreement (\"ALRA\") to be lodged with the Northern Territory Department of Mining and Energy (\"DME\") under the Petroleum Act 1984 (NT) to secure the granting of the exploration permit and consequent settlement of the previously announced Share Sale Agreement with Oilco. Georgina will hold a 100% working interest in EPA155.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"We are very pleased with this outstanding 15% increase (helium & hydrogen) to the recoverable resources in our Mt Winter asset, as well as the identification of a second larger target structure within our existing permit area which could provide significant potential to increase the resource.\nWe anticipate receiving the grant of the exploration permit and are working well with the regulators of the NT DME.\nGeorgina remains focused on re-entering both the Hussar and Mt Winter wells as part of our program to develop low-risk helium, hydrogen and natural gas projects in Australia.\n\"\nENDS\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliver Stansfield\nOak Securit",

Once the EIS2 study is completed and report finalised, the completed report will be lodged with DEMIRS by May 2025, supporting the drilling approval at Hussar. The cultural heritage survey is a final confirmation of the absence of culturally sensitive or heritage items at the drilling site.\nThe on-site team will include Company representatives, engineering consultancy Aztech Well Construction, two cultural history specialists, six Traditional Owners, and two environmental specialists. The Company remains in contact with\nstation owners, Traditional Owners and Shire Councils within the permit area to monitor the weather and will provide updates if there are any changes to the current status.\nEPA155 Mount Winter\nFollowing the execution of the Share Sale Agreement to acquire 100% interest in EPA155 Mt Winter, the Company has been advised that the draft ALRA agreement should arrive shortly. This is the final step in securing approval from the Northern Territory Minister for the Department of Mining and Energy for the selected priority area of EPA155.\nThe Company's consultants are reprocessing the seismic dataset and interpreting the relevant horizons and basement structures, incorporating updated volumetric details and remapping. This will provide an updated assessment of the resource potential at Mt Winter, with a final report expected April 2025.\nAdditional targets\nNegotiations are ongoing under relevant Confidentiality Agreements. The Company is awaiting a decision from the parties following discussions on the structure of the proposed transaction, which will be conditional on formal agreements.\nThe additional targets are advanced prospects with proven high concentrations of helium, hydrogen and hydrocarbons which remain a focus for post-Hussar and Mt Winter development.\nAnthony Hamilton, CEO of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"Despite the weather causing some adjustments to our timeline, the expanded structural closure at Hussar represents a larger opportunity than initially expected which is within our existing Exploration Permit area. Additionally, the successful acquisition of a 100% working interest in Mt Winter, subject to completion, adds significant value to the Company. I'd like to assure all of our shareholders that we remain committed to systematically advancing both projects and unlocking their full potential.\"\nEND\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliver Stansfield\nOak Securities - Joint Broker\nJerry Keen\n+44 (0)203 973 3678\nHenry Clarke\nDillon Anadkat\nFinancial PR via\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nViolet Wilson\n+44 (0)203 757 4980\nLetaba Rimell\nNotes to Editors\nGeorgina Energy aims to become a leading player in the global energy market and is focused on establishing itself among the top producers of helium and hydrogen worldwide.

The Harlequin offtake arrangement will include:\n\u00b7\nSale of raw gas at the wellhead to Harlequin who would be responsible for separating and processing the various commercial components inclusive of helium, hydrogen, argon and natural gas in the form of LNG.\n\u00b7\nHelium and hydrogen would be processed on-site to cryogenic products ready for export.\nScoping Study Summary\nThe base case provides a conceptual framework for the commercial development of the Hussar project.\nThe economic assessment for the Offtake Separation Plant to process helium, hydrogen, LNG, and argon is based on a raw gas wellhead delivery price of US$2.0/Mcf and assumes a 20-year project life.\nKey financial estimates include:\n\u00b7\nCapital Expenditure (Capex)\n:\u00a0US$1.13 billion\u00a0(for a\u00a040MMscf/day\u00a0separation plant), includes 10% discount rate.\n\u00b7\nGross Annual Revenue\n:\u00a0US$470.8 million.\n\u00b7\nNet Present Value (NPV):\nUS$1.64 billion.\n\u00b7\nInternal Rate of Return (IRR):\n27.3%.\n\u00b7\nKey Sensitivities\n:\no\nSignificant upside if helium prices exceed\u00a0US$700/Mcf, with an\u00a0IRR over 35% at US$900/Mcf.\no\nNegative impact if gas feed rates drop below\u00a030MMscf/day\u00a0or helium prices fall below\u00a0US$550/Mcf.\nBased on potential total field flow rates of between 10-60 MMCFGD, and sale prices for raw wellhead gas ranging from US$4-US$10/Mcf, the study estimates potential net pre-tax profits between:\n\u00b7\n$20,000 to $570,000/day\n\u00b7\n$7.3 million pa to $208 million per annum.\nThe wide range of outcomes reflect the early stage of development of the Hussar project and the potential scalability of production.\nThe scoping study can be found at:\nLink\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented: \"\nThe scoping study enhances the Company's understanding of the proposed off-take negotiations following the successful development of both Hussar and Mt Winter, which aim to produce commercial quantities of helium, hydrogen, and natural gas in Australia. Additionally, we anticipate an update on Hussar's progress regarding the EIS2, with planning currently underway.\"\nAlternative Development Strategy\nDue to the revenue stream being primarily dominated by helium sales, a lower cost alternative was also evaluated, focusing on helium and natural gas recovery, with the hydrogen component being utilised to provide energy for the separation and cryogenic production of LNG and helium.\nThis would require the design of a bespoke hydrogen oxidation unit to manage the relatively high concentration of hydrogen in the separated helium stream. Utilising this process would result in additional sales of LNG as the application of natural gas as an energy source for the plant operations would be at least partially supplanted by the oxidation of the hydrogen component.\nConclusion\nThe scoping study confirms that the development of a gas field at the Hussar Prospect to produce liquid helium, hydrogen, LNG and argon is a commercially viable option. Based on a 40MMscfd raw gas flow the project could produce an internal rate of return over 27%.\nGeorgina Executives are currently in London for further discussions with potential offtake partners, reinforcing the Company's commitment to advancing the commercialisation of its assets.\n",

The Company remains confident that a drilling approval will be secured shortly after DEMIRS returns on 3 January 2025.\nSeismic Reprocessing\n:\n\u00b7\nGeorgina has submitted reprocessed seismic data and revised mapping of the greater Officer Basin with DEMIRS together with a detailed re-assessment of the Hussar Prospect.\n\u00b7\nThe Hussar seismic reprocessing and remapping has resulted in a significant expansion of the structural closure, revealing additional development opportunities within the field and enhancing the scope of future field development.\nScoping Study\n:\n\u00b7\nThe Company has received first draft of a scoping study focused on the development of a large-scale gas separation and purification plant at Hussar, to be owned and operated by the offtake group.\n\u00b7\nThe study, led by an independent consultancy, provides capital and operating cost estimates, along with sensitivity analysis to support development decisions.\n\u00b7\nThe proposed plant aims to process helium, hydrogen, and natural gas, supporting the Company's clean energy strategy and enhancing project economics.\nMOUNT WINTER EPA155\nALRA Agreement:\n\u00b7\nFollowing the RNS on 11 December, the Company is currently awaiting receipt of the draft ALRA agreement as the final part of the process to obtaining ratification of the granting of the selected priority area of EPA155 from the Northern Territory Minister for the Department of Mining and Energy.\nSeismic Reprocessing:\n\u00b7\nGeorgina has engaged independent consultants to review the existing resource potential of the Mt Winter prospect. This review will follow completion of reprocessing and re-mapping of the existing 2D seismic data.\nADDITIONAL TARGETS\nPotential farm-ins:\n\u00b7\nGeorgina is actively negotiating potential farm-in agreements with two listed oil and gas companies. These agreements focus on advanced prospects already with proven occurrences of high concentrations of helium, hydrogen and hydrocarbons.\n\u00b7\nThe discussions are being held under Confidentiality Agreements. Subject to successful binding farm-in agreements being executed, these additional substantial targets will become priority targets following the completion of work at Hussar and Mt Winter.\n\u00b7\nThe Company will advise on any successful farm-in agreements as they arise.\nENDS\nEnquiries\nGeorgina Energy\nTony Hamilton\nvia\ngeorginaenergy@apcoworldwide.com\nMark Wallace\nTavira Financial Ltd - Financial Adviser and Joint Broker\nJonathan Evans\n+44 (0)20 3833 3719\nOliv",

Indeed who is the prtner ?  Harlequin Ltd the potless \u00a3100 asset company or its claimed parett inthe states ? Or the ananymous \"billionaire family office\"? I noticed the share jump 124% and mis read it as the price jumping to \u00a31.24p which it should be if the market believed the RNS, the market clearly does not believe a word of it , nor that there will not be further dilution  and that there will be another year for drilling to commence being 2 years behind Hamiltons undertaking to the market  to drill baby drill in December 2024 If wallace and his grommet were propoerly overseen by the board they would clear these mis communications up then the \u00a33m fubd raise to pay for their first class air fares and other essentials could be done at less dilution to the share holders , look out for more ramping of the stock ahead of the fund raise which is heading down the line like the train crash this will be eventually No doubt there will be the usual moronic claims as to my menatal health and or me being atthe sherry but these are relevant issues which need addressing Now back to the slopes for me sun shining and its snowed over night wonder ful  enjoy the sand pit kiddies",

I\u2019d expect to see news of orders for long lead items and the drill rig selection in the course of the next six weeks or so. After that we can possibly expect to see evidence of boots on the ground activity, I\u2019m sure there will be pics made available when appropriate. And then from June news of progress and rig status right up to drill. States ambition is to complete the initial drill in Q3, although by this time the winter weather may have impacted. I\u2019d hope they have this planned in. And, on top of all that there are the workstreams relating to Mt Winter prospect and the Jacko Bore etc, which should provide plenty of opportunities for positive news releases. I\u2019m sure AH wouldn\u2019t have teased the likely news streams if he wasn\u2019t confident they were going to be forthcoming (although there are some on here who say he can\u2019t be trusted). I fully expect to see the value of the company index up at each release as confidence grows. If gas flows from Hussar in the predicted manner by the end of Q3 then I expect the MC to hit \u00a3100m",

The Facility, of up to \u00a31,000,000, has a term of 3 years, and each drawdown of the debt has a term of 12 months.\nThe Company will use the gross proceeds of the drawdown to fund working capital and to continue the development of its portfolio and progress the transaction with Central Petroleum.\nWestmarket Oil & Gas, the operational subsidiary of the Company is fully funded having recently agreed a structured offtake finance arrangement with Harlequin Energy.\nDebt Facility\nThe First Drawdown of \u00a3300,000 occurred on 4th November 2025 and is convertible at 8 pence per share (\"Reference Price\") and each drawdown thereafter at a 50% premium to the 5-day VWAP preceding the drawdown. There is no interest to be applied to the loan.\nThe Company has now undertaken a Second Drawdown of \u00a3500,000 on the same terms as that agreed for the First Drawdown, that being convertible at a\npremium of 8.00 pence\n.\nIssue of Warrants\nThe Investor shall receive Warrants equal to 40% of each drawdown divided by the Reference Price, exercisable at a 50% premium to the relevant Reference Price being 8.00 pence (2.5 million warrants). Each issuance of Warrants will have a 48-month term from the date of issuance (which may be offset against outstanding debt if exercised). As with the First Drawdown, the Second Drawdown warrants will be exercisable at 8 pence.\nAnthony Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer of Georgina Energy, commented:\n\"We are delighted to have received the continued support from an Institutional Investor. This strategic investment not only strengthens our balance sheet but also underscores institutional confidence in our vision and asset base.

Let\u2019s just look at clarifying some of the nonsense and wilful admissions that were posted earlier with the sole purpose of creating doubt without due process or consideration. What we know \u2026. Harlequin has confirmed various points this week including funding. In order to do this and for the announcement to be made, they would have had to show proof of funds. Not just to GEX but to their independent advisors. Legal and financial. If anyone is casting doubt on this then they should be asking questions of those advisors. They are professional service firms after all. Schlumberger have also been announced. For this to happen Schlumberger would have also had to have signed off on any announcement which involved them.. They as the worlds largest contractor would not have done this lightly\u2026 AH also confirmed in his interview that he has been engaged with them. Bjet/Newbie/Dumley have ignored this through ignorance or stupidity, or both, or more seriously an attempt to scare investors\u2026. They\u2019ve then looked at companies house which only provides a snapshot of activity in England and Wales. Believing that to be the optimum source of information whilst wilfully ignoring what each company or individuals maybe doing elsewhere or where the money sits which is actually the key. This is not the gotcha that they think it is. Even on a basic level. Why would a US family route money through the U.K. for an Australian project? Given the current UK tax regime  I\u2019d also question the sanity of any E&P company being domiciled here or having a footprint without or without any assets in the U.K. All of this was done to sow discord amongst shareholders for no reason or for a reason which is yet to be discovered . Especially given the fact that they aren\u2019t shareholders. Are there issues to be dealt with on GEX - yes. Is it perfect - no. Is it been a slightly rough ride - yes The rubbish that was posted earlier should frankly be investigated. They all claim to be asking \u201cvalid questions\u201d but with no journalistic credibility and with the pompous self righteousness of Winnifrith and his ilk. Ignoring the obvious and promoting the irrelevant. It\u2019s been a good week for the long term holders. I\u2019m just fed up with the nonsense that was posted and people believing they have a gotcha when they don\u2019t have a clue. Have a good weekend one and all!",

I can't see the point of GEX rushing to get the prospectus approved now that all of the other funding is sorted as they won't need to hand over the money for the new well(s) until the transaction is given Ministerial consent from the Northern Territory Department of Mining and Energy - and we know how long that can take!!! Even if the prospectus does get approved (and that is not guaranteed with the sloppy management here) they can still hold back for the cash and then maybe they can raise it at multiples of the current share price. For now the worry of a small placing has gone.",

There are also still a number of factors to be considered in what would be a final agreement. I also met the BDO energy team last year. They know the family in the US, and they know Harlequin.

Indeed who is the prtner ?  Harlequin Ltd the potless \u00a3100 asset company or its claimed parett inthe states ? Or the ananymous \"billionaire family office\"? I noticed the share jump 124% and mis read it as the price jumping to \u00a31.24p which it should be if the market believed the RNS, the market clearly does not believe a word of it , nor that there will not be further dilution  and that there will be another year for drilling to commence being 2 years behind Hamiltons undertaking to the market  to drill baby drill in December 2024 If wallace and his grommet were propoerly overseen by the board they would clear these mis communications up then the \u00a33m fubd raise to pay for their first class air fares and other essentials could be done at less dilution to the share holders , look out for more ramping of the stock ahead of the fund raise which is heading down the line like the train crash this will be eventually No doubt there will be the usual moronic claims as to my menatal health and or me being atthe sherry but these are relevant issues which need addressing Now back to the slopes for me sun shining and its snowed over night wonder ful  enjoy the sand pit kiddies",

I\u2019d expect to see news of orders for long lead items and the drill rig selection in the course of the next six weeks or so. After that we can possibly expect to see evidence of boots on the ground activity, I\u2019m sure there will be pics made available when appropriate. And then from June news of progress and rig status right up to drill. States ambition is to complete the initial drill in Q3, although by this time the winter weather may have impacted. I\u2019d hope they have this planned in. And, on top of all that there are the workstreams relating to Mt Winter prospect and the Jacko Bore etc, which should provide plenty of opportunities for positive news releases. I\u2019m sure AH wouldn\u2019t have teased the likely news streams if he wasn\u2019t confident they were going to be forthcoming (although there are some on here who say he can\u2019t be trusted). I fully expect to see the value of the company index up at each release as confidence grows. If gas flows from Hussar in the predicted manner by the end of Q3 then I expect the MC to hit \u00a3100m",

The worlds markets label NOTHING, just print TRADES, they consider ALL being both a buy and sell, hence no labelling. Always multiple prices in play, not just what you see, Canadian exchange a good learning ground, they print the two brokers/institutions involved in the TRADE but if you look at what those parties have on the board for their buy and sell prices, they often do not match up. The Dimbo Algo, all GUESSES based on what IT thinks is current mid price and range, no matter when the TRADE placed 3 mins or 3 days ago. All above IT'S MID price = BUY------------------------Never the case All below IT'S MID price = SELL-----------------------Ditto All exactly on its MID , ALL delayed trades, not black trades, mm dark arts nonsense etc and anything it see's as outside of ITS now status range CHOKES = UNKNOWN, the alternate colour codes, follow the same garbage logic patterns.

If they bought in at that level and sold before the drill turned that's nobody's fault but there own. This is oil and gas and shxt happens, which brings me to your other snippets. I believe it was always GEX intention to have the offtaker fund the drill. Whether that was 2024, 25 or 26. Which would make their fully funded statement factually correct would it not? Yes they are delayed by a year due to a once in 80 years weather event and an expansion of the permit area, for which they have had to raise funds via placing and an interest free debt facility. Personally I think they have done a fantastic job of keeping Dilution to a minimum. This game ain't cheap Fact is if the drills successful, whether you bought in at 2.5p 0r 20p quite frankly you'll be laughing \ud83d\ude03. GLA",

Many found it irritating but he was right. All we're actually investing in is 'sentiment', it often becomes irrelevant whether the assets are ever eventually monetised in the future or not.

Last one I saw of theirs was for an 8 - 10 well rig deployment, covering exploration/appraisal and production drilling, across two fields. From what I have read, not expecting such a large scale event and CP/GEX will be running the timetable for Jacko Bore not Santos, that may change nearer, deal closure, finance and leading into a firm drill timetable. Still have a faint hope, once Mt Winter comes into play, which is also Amadeus basin, the 3 , Santos , CP and GEX, might review it all and perhaps Santos join in for a back to back , Winter, Jacko, Dukas program, who knows, like share prices , nothing in the Oil and Gas sector , moves in a fixed straight line either...  \ud83d\ude44",

Farmout discussions are progressing on Jack Bore 2 (EP125) to secure part funding for an appraisal well, to be drilled within 12 months. The proposed Jacko Bore 2 exploration well will target helium, naturally-occurring hydrogen and natural gas in the fractured basement by re-entering the existing Mt Kitty-1 (Jacko Bore-1) well and drilling a deviated/horizontal side track to test up to 500m of the fractured basement reservoir at a depth of approximately 2,000m. The vertical Mt Kitty-1 exploration well flowed gas containing 11.5% hydrogen and 9% helium at up to 530,000 scfd. The Dukas-1 exploration well (EP112) was drilled in 2019 and suspended after it encountered hydrocarbon-bearing gas from an over pressured zone close to the primary target, with traces of helium and hydrogen detected in mud gases. Central is progressing discussions to secure farmout funding for a new well at Dukas which will target the same sub-salt Heavitree formation with a higher-capacity rig. The interest holder has conducted activities in the project area since 2013, including 645.8 km of seismic acquisition (645.8 ha) and drilling of the Jacko Bore 1 well (previously named Mt Kitty 1) on the well site to be re-established, involving 53.47 ha of land clearing. During stakeholder engagement, a concern was raised by the Imanpa community\u2019s Traditional Owners about the name of the proposed appraisal well; Mt Kitty 2. To better reflect the cultural connection to the location, the original name of this activity, and the previously named Mt Kitty 1 well have been renamed to Jacko Bore 1 DW1 and Jacko Bore 1, respectively. The proposed well will be a horizontal/highly deviated well, which will be drilled from the existing Jacko Bore 1 surface hole. If the casing on Jacko Bore 1 fails, this well will be plugged and abandoned. The horizontal Jacko Bore 2 well will then be drilled approximately 20 metres from the existing well.",

Let\u2019s just look at clarifying some of the nonsense and wilful admissions that were posted earlier with the sole purpose of creating doubt without due process or consideration. What we know \u2026. Harlequin has confirmed various points this week including funding. In order to do this and for the announcement to be made, they would have had to show proof of funds. Not just to GEX but to their independent advisors. Legal and financial. If anyone is casting doubt on this then they should be asking questions of those advisors. They are professional service firms after all. Schlumberger have also been announced. For this to happen Schlumberger would have also had to have signed off on any announcement which involved them.. They as the worlds largest contractor would not have done this lightly\u2026 AH also confirmed in his interview that he has been engaged with them. Bjet/Newbie/Dumley have ignored this through ignorance or stupidity, or both, or more seriously an attempt to scare investors\u2026. They\u2019ve then looked at companies house which only provides a snapshot of activity in England and Wales. Believing that to be the optimum source of information whilst wilfully ignoring what each company or individuals maybe doing elsewhere or where the money sits which is actually the key. This is not the gotcha that they think it is. Even on a basic level. Why would a US family route money through the U.K. for an Australian project? Given the current UK tax regime  I\u2019d also question the sanity of any E&P company being domiciled here or having a footprint without or without any assets in the U.K. All of this was done to sow discord amongst shareholders for no reason or for a reason which is yet to be discovered . Especially given the fact that they aren\u2019t shareholders. Are there issues to be dealt with on GEX - yes. Is it perfect - no. Is it been a slightly rough ride - yes The rubbish that was posted earlier should frankly be investigated. They all claim to be asking \u201cvalid questions\u201d but with no journalistic credibility and with the pompous self righteousness of Winnifrith and his ilk. Ignoring the obvious and promoting the irrelevant. It\u2019s been a good week for the long term holders. I\u2019m just fed up with the nonsense that was posted and people believing they have a gotcha when they don\u2019t have a clue. Have a good weekend one and all!",

There are also still a number of factors to be considered in what would be a final agreement. I also met the BDO energy team last year. They know the family in the US, and they know Harlequin. They are or have been auditors for their others assets. Others have mocked this, but I don't really care as I was satisfied.",

Indeed who is the prtner ?  Harlequin Ltd the potless \u00a3100 asset company or its claimed parett inthe states ? Or the ananymous \"billionaire family office\"? I noticed the share jump 124% and mis read it as the price jumping to \u00a31.24p which it should be if the market believed the RNS, the market clearly does not believe a word of it , nor that there will not be further dilution  and that there will be another year for drilling to commence being 2 years behind Hamiltons undertaking to the market  to drill baby drill in December 2024 If wallace and his grommet were propoerly overseen by the board they would clear these mis communications up then the \u00a33m fubd raise to pay for their first class air fares and other essentials could be done at less dilution to the share holders , look out for more ramping of the stock ahead of the fund raise which is heading down the line like the train crash this will be eventually No doubt there will be the usual moronic claims as to my menatal health and or me being atthe sherry but these are relevant issues which need addressing Now back to the slopes for me sun shining and its snowed over night wonder ful  enjoy the sand pit kiddies",

After that we can possibly expect to see evidence of boots on the ground activity, I\u2019m sure there will be pics made available when appropriate. And then from June news of progress and rig status right up to drill. States ambition is to complete the initial drill in Q3, although by this time the winter weather may have impacted. I\u2019d hope they have this planned in. And, on top of all that there are the workstreams relating to Mt Winter prospect and the Jacko Bore etc, which should provide plenty of opportunities for positive news releases. I\u2019m sure AH wouldn\u2019t have teased the likely news streams if he wasn\u2019t confident they were going to be forthcoming (although there are some on here who say he can\u2019t be trusted). I fully expect to see the value of the company index up at each release as confidence grows. If gas flows from Hussar in the predicted manner by the end of Q3 then I expect the MC to hit \u00a3100m",

In order to do this they would have to provide proof of funding not just to GEX but to their external advisors. If you think they are compromised then take it up with them. Harlequin are based in the Caymans. Companies House is therefore irrelevant. They\u2019ve also engaged the world\u2019s largest contractor\u2026. I hope that this helps.

Most forward sell, from a pumped high and back down again, starting on or many long before the placing message and date of shares to market arrive, if the pump enough, they are more than happy to go below the placing price, for a final clearance sale, never feel sorry for them, they win every time and usually get a secondary placing (warrants) at the same time, that cost them nothing, if company successful, the take them and make more quick profit, if its not they just let them lapse, little risk to them in either case, unlike the rest of us, pays ya money and takes your chance.........GLALTH Market considers all TRADES printed as BOTH a buy/sell, so they do not label, just 3rd party sites like this one confuse all the pricing with GUESSES.",

As much use as a chocolate tea pot, so the associated stats like buy v sell volume ratio's etc, likewise WORTHLESS. The worlds markets label NOTHING, just print TRADES, they consider ALL being both a buy and sell, hence no labelling. Always multiple prices in play, not just what you see, Canadian exchange a good learning ground, they print the two brokers/institutions involved in the TRADE but if you look at what those parties have on the board for their buy and sell prices, they often do not match up. The Dimbo Algo, all GUESSES based on what IT thinks is current mid price and range, no matter when the TRADE placed 3 mins or 3 days ago. All above IT'S MID price = BUY------------------------Never the case All below IT'S MID price = SELL-----------------------Ditto All exactly on its MID , ALL delayed trades, not black trades, mm dark arts nonsense etc and anything it see's as outside of ITS now status range CHOKES = UNKNOWN, the alternate colour codes, follow the same garbage logic patterns. It's as simple and tragic as that, markets offered the simple modern tech fix, to add real time data at source, declined choosing TRADITION over tech BUT you could also say, quite happy to leave us all in the dark and confusion reign via 3rd party sites like this one adding GUESSES to all TRADES. \ud83d\ude44",

If they bought in at that level and sold before the drill turned that's nobody's fault but there own. This is oil and gas and shxt happens, which brings me to your other snippets. I believe it was always GEX intention to have the offtaker fund the drill. Whether that was 2024, 25 or 26. Which would make their fully funded statement factually correct would it not? Yes they are delayed by a year due to a once in 80 years weather event and an expansion of the permit area, for which they have had to raise funds via placing and an interest free debt facility. Personally I think they have done a fantastic job of keeping Dilution to a minimum. This game ain't cheap Fact is if the drills successful, whether you bought in at 2.5p 0r 20p quite frankly you'll be laughing \ud83d\ude03. GLA",

As much use as a chocolate tea pot, so the associated stats like buy v sell volume ratio's etc, likewise WORTHLESS. The worlds markets label NOTHING, just print TRADES, they consider ALL being both a buy and sell, hence no labelling. Always multiple prices in play, not just what you see, Canadian exchange a good learning ground, they print the two brokers/institutions involved in the TRADE but if you look at what those parties have on the board for their buy and sell prices, they often do not match up. The Dimbo Algo, all GUESSES based on what IT thinks is current mid price and range, no matter when the TRADE placed 3 mins or 3 days ago. All above IT'S MID price = BUY------------------------Never the case All below IT'S MID price = SELL-----------------------Ditto All exactly on its MID , ALL delayed trades, not black trades, mm dark arts nonsense etc and anything it see's as outside of ITS now status range CHOKES = UNKNOWN, the alternate colour codes, follow the same garbage logic patterns. It's as simple and tragic as that, markets offered the simple modern tech fix, to add real time data at source, declined choosing TRADITION over tech BUT you could also say, quite happy to leave us all in the dark and confusion reign via 3rd party sites like this one adding GUESSES to all TRADES. \ud83d\ude44",

If they bought in at that level and sold before the drill turned that's nobody's fault but there own. This is oil and gas and shxt happens, which brings me to your other snippets. I believe it was always GEX intention to have the offtaker fund the drill. Whether that was 2024, 25 or 26. Which would make their fully funded statement factually correct would it not? Yes they are delayed by a year due to a once in 80 years weather event and an expansion of the permit area, for which they have had to raise funds via placing and an interest free debt facility. Personally I think they have done a fantastic job of keeping Dilution to a minimum. This game ain't cheap Fact is if the drills successful, whether you bought in at 2.5p 0r 20p quite frankly you'll be laughing \ud83d\ude03. GLA",

If work starts late this month, then it should be completed by mid/late April, giving plenty of time to set up prior to re-entry / new spud for even a 1st day of Q3 start, we will have more of an idea, once the preps start, sooner they start, sooner completed, sooner (earlier drill) operations can begin........GLALTH. On the other side of things, which drill selected  and which dates is IT AVAILABLE , free as a bird, or just an open slot between other ops. Could determine if an earlier start even possible. As with all things oil and gas, its a time consuming process, getting the jigsaw pieces all in place, to go ahead and spud on time.",

From what I have read, not expecting such a large scale event and CP/GEX will be running the timetable for Jacko Bore not Santos, that may change nearer, deal closure, finance and leading into a firm drill timetable. Still have a faint hope, once Mt Winter comes into play, which is also Amadeus basin, the 3 , Santos , CP and GEX, might review it all and perhaps Santos join in for a back to back , Winter, Jacko, Dukas program, who knows, like share prices , nothing in the Oil and Gas sector , moves in a fixed straight line either...  \ud83d\ude44",

Farmout discussions are progressing on Jack Bore 2 (EP125) to secure part funding for an appraisal well, to be drilled within 12 months. The proposed Jacko Bore 2 exploration well will target helium, naturally-occurring hydrogen and natural gas in the fractured basement by re-entering the existing Mt Kitty-1 (Jacko Bore-1) well and drilling a deviated/horizontal side track to test up to 500m of the fractured basement reservoir at a depth of approximately 2,000m. The vertical Mt Kitty-1 exploration well flowed gas containing 11.5% hydrogen and 9% helium at up to 530,000 scfd. The Dukas-1 exploration well (EP112) was drilled in 2019 and suspended after it encountered hydrocarbon-bearing gas from an over pressured zone close to the primary target, with traces of helium and hydrogen detected in mud gases. Central is progressing discussions to secure farmout funding for a new well at Dukas which will target the same sub-salt Heavitree formation with a higher-capacity rig. The interest holder has conducted activities in the project area since 2013, including 645.8 km of seismic acquisition (645.8 ha) and drilling of the Jacko Bore 1 well (previously named Mt Kitty 1) on the well site to be re-established, involving 53.47 ha of land clearing. During stakeholder engagement, a concern was raised by the Imanpa community\u2019s Traditional Owners about the name of the proposed appraisal well; Mt Kitty 2. To better reflect the cultural connection to the location, the original name of this activity, and the previously named Mt Kitty 1 well have been renamed to Jacko Bore 1 DW1 and Jacko Bore 1, respectively. The proposed well will be a horizontal/highly deviated well, which will be drilled from the existing Jacko Bore 1 surface hole. If the casing on Jacko Bore 1 fails, this well will be plugged and abandoned. The horizontal Jacko Bore 2 well will then be drilled approximately 20 metres from the existing well.",

Let\u2019s just look at clarifying some of the nonsense and wilful admissions that were posted earlier with the sole purpose of creating doubt without due process or consideration. What we know \u2026. Harlequin has confirmed various points this week including funding. In order to do this and for the announcement to be made, they would have had to show proof of funds. Not just to GEX but to their independent advisors. Legal and financial. If anyone is casting doubt on this then they should be asking questions of those advisors. They are professional service firms after all. Schlumberger have also been announced. For this to happen Schlumberger would have also had to have signed off on any announcement which involved them.. They as the worlds largest contractor would not have done this lightly\u2026 AH also confirmed in his interview that he has been engaged with them. Bjet/Newbie/Dumley have ignored this through ignorance or stupidity, or both, or more seriously an attempt to scare investors\u2026. They\u2019ve then looked at companies house which only provides a snapshot of activity in England and Wales. Believing that to be the optimum source of information whilst wilfully ignoring what each company or individuals maybe doing elsewhere or where the money sits which is actually the key. This is not the gotcha that they think it is. Even on a basic level. Why would a US family route money through the U.K. for an Australian project? Given the current UK tax regime  I\u2019d also question the sanity of any E&P company being domiciled here or having a footprint without or without any assets in the U.K. All of this was done to sow discord amongst shareholders for no reason or for a reason which is yet to be discovered . Especially given the fact that they aren\u2019t shareholders. Are there issues to be dealt with on GEX - yes. Is it perfect - no. Is it been a slightly rough ride - yes The rubbish that was posted earlier should frankly be investigated. They all claim to be asking \u201cvalid questions\u201d but with no journalistic credibility and with the pompous self righteousness of Winnifrith and his ilk. Ignoring the obvious and promoting the irrelevant. It\u2019s been a good week for the long term holders. I\u2019m just fed up with the nonsense that was posted and people believing they have a gotcha when they don\u2019t have a clue. Have a good weekend one and all!",

Not all companies have company numbers on their website, and that includes BP and Shell, so I'm not sure of the relevance. There are also still a number of factors to be considered in what would be a final agreement. I also met the BDO energy team last year. They know the family in the US, and they know Harlequin. They are or have been auditors for their others assets. Others have mocked this, but I don't really care as I was satisfied.",

Indeed who is the prtner ?  Harlequin Ltd the potless \u00a3100 asset company or its claimed parett inthe states ? Or the ananymous \"billionaire family office\"? I noticed the share jump 124% and mis read it as the price jumping to \u00a31.24p which it should be if the market believed the RNS, the market clearly does not believe a word of it , nor that there will not be further dilution  and that there will be another year for drilling to commence being 2 years behind Hamiltons undertaking to the market  to drill baby drill in December 2024 If wallace and his grommet were propoerly overseen by the board they would clear these mis communications up then the \u00a33m fubd raise to pay for their first class air fares and other essentials could be done at less dilution to the share holders , look out for more ramping of the stock ahead of the fund raise which is heading down the line like the train crash this will be eventually No doubt there will be the usual moronic claims as to my menatal health and or me being atthe sherry but these are relevant issues which need addressing Now back to the slopes for me sun shining and its snowed over night wonder ful  enjoy the sand pit kiddies",

I think it will flow to surface :\u00ac) That said A H is not taking any chances and will have a well - head BOP Valve capable of 10,000 psi - 12,000 psi. With fracturing and hitting the horizontal reservoir we should be in good flow figur volumes. If it's there!",

After that we can possibly expect to see evidence of boots on the ground activity, I\u2019m sure there will be pics made available when appropriate. And then from June news of progress and rig status right up to drill. States ambition is to complete the initial drill in Q3, although by this time the winter weather may have impacted. I\u2019d hope they have this planned in. And, on top of all that there are the workstreams relating to Mt Winter prospect and the Jacko Bore etc, which should provide plenty of opportunities for positive news releases. I\u2019m sure AH wouldn\u2019t have teased the likely news streams if he wasn\u2019t confident they were going to be forthcoming (although there are some on here who say he can\u2019t be trusted). I fully expect to see the value of the company index up at each release as confidence grows. If gas flows from Hussar in the predicted manner by the end of Q3 then I expect the MC to hit \u00a3100m",

I think it will flow to surface without needing to be 'lifted'. Not only do I also think that Schlumberger and Aztech will look at fracturing to increase flow rates I do believe multiple wells were discussed. If revenue streams are established then extra wells could run alongside / at the same time as MT Winter / MT Kitty / Dukas as revenue  will allow self financing. However, let's walk before we can run. If Hussar is commercial we have cracked it and will become a Global Helium & Hydrogen  producer seeing as the other drills have produced world class concentrations with MT Kitty flowing to surface. atb.",

As much use as a chocolate tea pot, so the associated stats like buy v sell volume ratio's etc, likewise WORTHLESS. The worlds markets label NOTHING, just print TRADES, they consider ALL being both a buy and sell, hence no labelling. Always multiple prices in play, not just what you see, Canadian exchange a good learning ground, they print the two brokers/institutions involved in the TRADE but if you look at what those parties have on the board for their buy and sell prices, they often do not match up. The Dimbo Algo, all GUESSES based on what IT thinks is current mid price and range, no matter when the TRADE placed 3 mins or 3 days ago. All above IT'S MID price = BUY------------------------Never the case All below IT'S MID price = SELL-----------------------Ditto All exactly on its MID , ALL delayed trades, not black trades, mm dark arts nonsense etc and anything it see's as outside of ITS now status range CHOKES = UNKNOWN, the alternate colour codes, follow the same garbage logic patterns. It's as simple and tragic as that, markets offered the simple modern tech fix, to add real time data at source, declined choosing TRADITION over tech BUT you could also say, quite happy to leave us all in the dark and confusion reign via 3rd party sites like this one adding GUESSES to all TRADES. \ud83d\ude44",

If they bought in at that level and sold before the drill turned that's nobody's fault but there own. This is oil and gas and shxt happens, which brings me to your other snippets. I believe it was always GEX intention to have the offtaker fund the drill. Whether that was 2024, 25 or 26. Which would make their fully funded statement factually correct would it not? Yes they are delayed by a year due to a once in 80 years weather event and an expansion of the permit area, for which they have had to raise funds via placing and an interest free debt facility. Personally I think they have done a fantastic job of keeping Dilution to a minimum. This game ain't cheap Fact is if the drills successful, whether you bought in at 2.5p 0r 20p quite frankly you'll be laughing \ud83d\ude03. GLA",

As much use as a chocolate tea pot, so the associated stats like buy v sell volume ratio's etc, likewise WORTHLESS. The worlds markets label NOTHING, just print TRADES, they consider ALL being both a buy and sell, hence no labelling. Always multiple prices in play, not just what you see, Canadian exchange a good learning ground, they print the two brokers/institutions involved in the TRADE but if you look at what those parties have on the board for their buy and sell prices, they often do not match up. The Dimbo Algo, all GUESSES based on what IT thinks is current mid price and range, no matter when the TRADE placed 3 mins or 3 days ago. All above IT'S MID price = BUY------------------------Never the case All below IT'S MID price = SELL-----------------------Ditto All exactly on its MID , ALL delayed trades, not black trades, mm dark arts nonsense etc and anything it see's as outside of ITS now status range CHOKES = UNKNOWN, the alternate colour codes, follow the same garbage logic patterns. It's as simple and tragic as that, markets offered the simple modern tech fix, to add real time data at source, declined choosing TRADITION over tech BUT you could also say, quite happy to leave us all in the dark and confusion reign via 3rd party sites like this one adding GUESSES to all TRADES. \ud83d\ude44",

The Company has now undertaken a Second Drawdown of \u00a3500,000 on the same terms as that agreed for the First Drawdown, that being convertible at a premium of 8.00 pence. Issue of Warrants The Investor shall receive Warrants equal to 40% of each drawdown divided by the Reference Price, exercisable at a 50% premium to the relevant Reference Price being 8.00 pence (2.5 million warrants). Each issuance of Warrants will have a 48-month term from the date of issuance (which may be offset against outstanding debt if exercised). As with the First Drawdown, the Second Drawdown warrants will be exercisable at 8 pence.",

If they bought in at that level and sold before the drill turned that's nobody's fault but there own. This is oil and gas and shxt happens, which brings me to your other snippets. I believe it was always GEX intention to have the offtaker fund the drill. Whether that was 2024, 25 or 26. Which would make their fully funded statement factually correct would it not? Yes they are delayed by a year due to a once in 80 years weather event and an expansion of the permit area, for which they have had to raise funds via placing and an interest free debt facility. Personally I think they have done a fantastic job of keeping Dilution to a minimum. This game ain't cheap Fact is if the drills successful, whether you bought in at 2.5p 0r 20p quite frankly you'll be laughing \ud83d\ude03. GLA",

Q1 (01 Jan - 31st March)Tender & contract drilling rig (currently 4 appropriate rigs available) The rest, until things progress etc, the plan appears to be have that rig onsite at the latest late Q2 (Apr-Jun)  ASAP after site preps completed, which previously was RNA updated to be a probable up to 50 days (near 2 months) to complete. If work starts late this month, then it should be completed by mid/late April, giving plenty of time to set up prior to re-entry / new spud for even a 1st day of Q3 start, we will have more of an idea, once the preps start, sooner they start, sooner completed, sooner (earlier drill) operations can begin........GLALTH. On the other side of things, which drill selected  and which dates is IT AVAILABLE , free as a bird, or just an open slot between other ops. Could determine if an earlier start even possible. As with all things oil and gas, its a time consuming process, getting the jigsaw pieces all in place, to go ahead and spud on time.",

From what I have read, not expecting such a large scale event and CP/GEX will be running the timetable for Jacko Bore not Santos, that may change nearer, deal closure, finance and leading into a firm drill timetable. Still have a faint hope, once Mt Winter comes into play, which is also Amadeus basin, the 3 , Santos , CP and GEX, might review it all and perhaps Santos join in for a back to back , Winter, Jacko, Dukas program, who knows, like share prices , nothing in the Oil and Gas sector , moves in a fixed straight line either...  \ud83d\ude44",

Farmout discussions are progressing on Jack Bore 2 (EP125) to secure part funding for an appraisal well, to be drilled within 12 months. The proposed Jacko Bore 2 exploration well will target helium, naturally-occurring hydrogen and natural gas in the fractured basement by re-entering the existing Mt Kitty-1 (Jacko Bore-1) well and drilling a deviated/horizontal side track to test up to 500m of the fractured basement reservoir at a depth of approximately 2,000m. The vertical Mt Kitty-1 exploration well flowed gas containing 11.5% hydrogen and 9% helium at up to 530,000 scfd. The Dukas-1 exploration well (EP112) was drilled in 2019 and suspended after it encountered hydrocarbon-bearing gas from an over pressured zone close to the primary target, with traces of helium and hydrogen detected in mud gases. Central is progressing discussions to secure farmout funding for a new well at Dukas which will target the same sub-salt Heavitree formation with a higher-capacity rig. The interest holder has conducted activities in the project area since 2013, including 645.8 km of seismic acquisition (645.8 ha) and drilling of the Jacko Bore 1 well (previously named Mt Kitty 1) on the well site to be re-established, involving 53.47 ha of land clearing. During stakeholder engagement, a concern was raised by the Imanpa community\u2019s Traditional Owners about the name of the proposed appraisal well; Mt Kitty 2. To better reflect the cultural connection to the location, the original name of this activity, and the previously named Mt Kitty 1 well have been renamed to Jacko Bore 1 DW1 and Jacko Bore 1, respectively. The proposed well will be a horizontal/highly deviated well, which will be drilled from the existing Jacko Bore 1 surface hole. If the casing on Jacko Bore 1 fails, this well will be plugged and abandoned. The horizontal Jacko Bore 2 well will then be drilled approximately 20 metres from the existing well.",

Let\u2019s just look at clarifying some of the nonsense and wilful admissions that were posted earlier with the sole purpose of creating doubt without due process or consideration. What we know \u2026. Harlequin has confirmed various points this week including funding. In order to do this and for the announcement to be made, they would have had to show proof of funds. Not just to GEX but to their independent advisors. Legal and financial. If anyone is casting doubt on this then they should be asking questions of those advisors. They are professional service firms after all. Schlumberger have also been announced. For this to happen Schlumberger would have also had to have signed off on any announcement which involved them.. They as the worlds largest contractor would not have done this lightly\u2026 AH also confirmed in his interview that he has been engaged with them. Bjet/Newbie/Dumley have ignored this through ignorance or stupidity, or both, or more seriously an attempt to scare investors\u2026. They\u2019ve then looked at companies house which only provides a snapshot of activity in England and Wales. Believing that to be the optimum source of information whilst wilfully ignoring what each company or individuals maybe doing elsewhere or where the money sits which is actually the key. This is not the gotcha that they think it is. Even on a basic level. Why would a US family route money through the U.K. for an Australian project? Given the current UK tax regime  I\u2019d also question the sanity of any E&P company being domiciled here or having a footprint without or without any assets in the U.K. All of this was done to sow discord amongst shareholders for no reason or for a reason which is yet to be discovered . Especially given the fact that they aren\u2019t shareholders. Are there issues to be dealt with on GEX - yes. Is it perfect - no. Is it been a slightly rough ride - yes The rubbish that was posted earlier should frankly be investigated. They all claim to be asking \u201cvalid questions\u201d but with no journalistic credibility and with the pompous self righteousness of Winnifrith and his ilk. Ignoring the obvious and promoting the irrelevant. It\u2019s been a good week for the long term holders. I\u2019m just fed up with the nonsense that was posted and people believing they have a gotcha when they don\u2019t have a clue. Have a good weekend one and all!",

There are also still a number of factors to be considered in what would be a final agreement. I also met the BDO energy team last year. They know the family in the US, and they know Harlequin. They are or have been auditors for their others assets. Others have mocked this, but I don't really care as I was satisfied.",

Is Matt about to stich nick up  worth a false promise of a peace of the pie making h a director of a company that the contract isn\u2019t signed with \u2026.. read between lines folks look at the split with halo directors at same time and competing bids after they  are clearly a bunch of chambers with form for sticking up and inability to follow basis company laws ie company number on website and letter heads\u2026. These are basics",

Indeed who is the prtner ?  Harlequin Ltd the potless \u00a3100 asset company or its claimed parett inthe states ? Or the ananymous \"billionaire family office\"? I noticed the share jump 124% and mis read it as the price jumping to \u00a31.24p which it should be if the market believed the RNS, the market clearly does not believe a word of it , nor that there will not be further dilution  and that there will be another year for drilling to commence being 2 years behind Hamiltons undertaking to the market  to drill baby drill in December 2024 If wallace and his grommet were propoerly overseen by the board they would clear these mis communications up then the \u00a33m fubd raise to pay for their first class air fares and other essentials could be done at less dilution to the share holders , look out for more ramping of the stock ahead of the fund raise which is heading down the line like the train crash this will be eventually No doubt there will be the usual moronic claims as to my menatal health and or me being atthe sherry but these are relevant issues which need addressing Now back to the slopes for me sun shining and its snowed over night wonder ful  enjoy the sand pit kiddies",

After that we can possibly expect to see evidence of boots on the ground activity, I\u2019m sure there will be pics made available when appropriate. And then from June news of progress and rig status right up to drill. States ambition is to complete the initial drill in Q3, although by this time the winter weather may have impacted. I\u2019d hope they have this planned in. And, on top of all that there are the workstreams relating to Mt Winter prospect and the Jacko Bore etc, which should provide plenty of opportunities for positive news releases. I\u2019m sure AH wouldn\u2019t have teased the likely news streams if he wasn\u2019t confident they were going to be forthcoming (although there are some on here who say he can\u2019t be trusted). I fully expect to see the value of the company index up at each release as confidence grows. If gas flows from Hussar in the predicted manner by the end of Q3 then I expect the MC to hit \u00a3100m",
