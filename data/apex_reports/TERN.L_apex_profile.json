If neither an exit nor a relevant fundraising has taken place, the CLNs will mature on 21 November 2029, in line with the approximately \u00a30.3 million of convertible loan notes that the Company already holds in Talking Medicines.\nAs at 30 June 2025, the date of Tern's last published book valuation, Tern's equity and convertible loan note holding in Talking Medicines had a total unaudited book value of \u00a32.1 million. Following the issue of the CLN, Tern's equity holding in Talking Medicines will be unchanged and Tern will continue to hold approximately 23.8% of Talking Medicines' equity, but now with an increased total convertible loan note holding of approximately \u00a30.52 million.\nTalking Medicines is in the process of raising up to \u00a31.0 million of new funding from new and existing investors through the issue of CLNs on the same terms.\nFurther information on Talking Medicines\nTalking Medicines uses Advanced Data Science and Artificial Intelligence to empower healthcare advertising agencies, enabling them to consistently win and retain their Pharma clients whilst achieving improved productivity, with swift project delivery. Talking Medicines is seeking to revolutionise the over US$23bn healthcare advertising market (Research and Markets, Healthcare Advertising Market Report 2025), through unlocking strategic intelligence within conversational data. Talking Medicines empowers customers to gain strategic advantages in analysis, measurement, and enhanced brand equity through structuring conversational data.\nBased on Talking Medicines' latest statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024, as at that date it had net liabilities of approximately \u00a31.4 million and incurred a loss for the year of approximately \u00a30.51 million. Given the historic nature of these figures, Tern does not consider this to be representative of the current business, trading performance and prospects of Talking Medicines.\nEnquiries\nTern Plc\nJane McCracken (Interim Non-Executive Chair)\nvia IFC Advisory\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: 0203 328 5656\nIFC Advisory\n(Financial PR and IR)\nTim Metcalfe\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Staton\nTel: 0203 934 6632\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "announcement_date": "28th Nov 2025",
          "release_time": "7:00 am",
          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "28 Nov 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 3597J\nTern PLC\n28 November 2025\n28 November 2025\nTern Plc\n(\"Tern\" or the \"Company\")\nUpdate regarding capital commitment to SVV2\nTern Plc (\"Tern\" or the \"Company\"), the AIM\n\u2011\nquoted investment company, provides the following update regarding its capital commitment to Sure Valley Ventures Enterprise Capital Fund LP (\n\"\nSVV2\n\"\n). As announced on 2 March 2022, Tern committed to invest up to\n\u00a3\n5 million in SVV2 over the fund's 10-year life and is required to provide capital to SVV2 from time to time, often at short notice. As at 30 June 2025, the unaudited fair value of Tern's shareholding in SVV2 was approximately\n\u00a3\n0.8 million. To date, Tern has invested approximately\n\u00a3\n1.3 million into SVV2.\nAt the Company's AGM held on 30 June 2025 the resolution to give the Directors the authority to disapply pre\n\u2011\nemption rights when allotting shares for cash was not approved. Subsequently, the open offer to Tern shareholders in October 2025 to raise up to\n\u00a3\n642,486 only delivered gross proceeds of\n\u00a3\n151,136. The limited funds raised through the last open offer and the inability of the Company to raise funds via the issue of new shares on a non pre-emptive basis, has led the Directors to conclude that the Company has insufficient funds, or potential access to future funding in the short to medium-term, for the Company to meet SVV2's capital calls.\nThe Board respects shareholder views, and after exhausting what it considers to be all reasonable mitigation measures, including salary reductions, open offer fundraising, shareholder engagement, and collaborative effort with SVV2 to identify a replacement investor, Tern has requested relief from its funding obligations to SVV2. The General Partner of SVV2 has confirmed that, under the terms of the SVV2 Limited Partnership Agreement (\"LPA\"), this will result in Tern being classified as a 'defaulting investor'. Remedies available under the LPA include forfeiture of existing capital or compulsory transfer of Tern's interest. In the event that Tern's existing paid\n\u2011\nin capital is not required to be forfeited, and no other SVV2 Limited Partner elects to assume Tern's commitment, Tern's paid\n\u2011\nin capital will remain invested within SVV2 until the cessation of the fund, at which point any residual value will be returned in accordance with the LPA, although defaulting investor status may reduce Tern's rights to distributions during the life of the fund and could limit Tern's recovery compared to non-defaulting investors. Tern will make further updates in relation to the position with SVV2 as appropriate.\nAn announcement by Tern on 15 October 2025 noted that, following the receipt of the net proceeds from the result of the open offer announced on that date, in the absence of Tern raising further funds or disposing of investments, and on the basis that Tern does not make any investments in its portfolio (including funding its investment in SVV2), the Directors believe that the Company would maintain a cash runway which is expected to extend into the first half of Q1 2026. The Directors continue to believe this cash runway remains unchanged.\nTern intends to continue to act as a constructive partner in respect of SVV2 investments already funded and will maintain its focus on protecting shareholder interests and long\n\u2011\nterm value creation from its key portfolio companies, Device Authority, FundamentalVR and Talking Medicines.\nEnquiries\nTern Plc\nJane McCracken (Interim Non-Executive Chair)\nvia IFC Advisory\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: 0203 328 5656\nIFC Advisory\n(Financial PR and IR)\nTim Metcalfe\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Staton\nTel: 0203 934 6630\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
