          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 7646R\nTern PLC\n05 February 2026\nREACH - non-regulatory announcement*\n5 February 2026\nTern Plc\n(\"Tern\" or the \"Company\")\nTern Notes Automotive Momentum at Device Authority\nTern Plc (AIM:TERN),\nthe investment company specialising in supporting high growth, early-stage, disruptive Internet of Things (\"IoT\") technology businesses\n, is pleased to note\nthat Device Authority Limited (\"Device Authority\"), a company in which Tern currently holds 25.3% of the equity, has today\nannounced further momentum in the automotive sector, securing a new OEM customer alongside the expansion of an existing Tier 1 automotive deployment.\nThe update from Device Authority confirms the addition of a significant new automotive OEM customer, together with the expansion of an existing Tier 1 automotive deployment. Device Authority considers that the new and expanded programmes support a shift by automotive manufacturers towards OEM-owned cryptographic key management, providing centralised governance of keys, certificates and signing operations across multiple vehicle platforms and supplier tiers. Device Authority considers that this approach is intended to strengthen cybersecurity, simplify compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks across globally distributed automotive supply chains.\nExtracts from the Device Authority announcement:\nDevice Authority, a leader in identity and key lifecycle automation for connected devices, today announced it has secured a significant new automotive customer as well as expanded an existing automotive deployment, as manufacturers move to bring cryptographic key management under direct OEM ownership to strengthen cybersecurity, simplify mandatory compliance, reduce supply chain risk and comply with new market expansion.\nAs modern vehicles continue to become increasingly software-defined and connected, making cryptographic trust foundational to safety, secure software updates, and long-term platform integrity are key. Also, as regulatory expectations intensify-via frameworks including UN R155/R156, ISO/SAE 21434, and the EU Cyber Resilience Act, automotive manufacturers are prioritising centralized, OEM-governed control over cryptographic keys, certificates, and signing operations across globally distributed supply chains.\nThe latest OEM to select Device Authority did so to support an OEM-owned model for cryptographic key governance across multiple vehicle platforms and supplier tiers. The programme is designed to provide centralized lifecycle control over keys and certificates used for core automotive security functions, including software/firmware signing, secure communications, and device identity across vehicle and cloud systems.\nIn parallel, Device Authority has expanded its work with an existing automotive customer, extending coverage to additional production lines and supplier integrations. The expansion reflects growing operational demand for unified cryptographic policy enforcement, accelerated supplier onboarding into a consistent trust framework, and evidence-ready audit trails that can support cybersecurity management and software update management workflows, across many millions of identities and across hundreds of thousands of vehicles.\nHistorically, many OEMs permitted suppliers to generate and manage keys independently. However, fragmented key ownership can create audit blind spots, slow incident response, and complicate certificate revocation or algorithm changes at fleet scale-particularly across the 10-20 year lifecycle of vehicles. Centralized key management restores OEM authority by enabling real-time visibility into certificate and key lifecycles, automated rotation and revocation, and consistent cryptographic standards across suppliers and components.\nDarron Antill, Device Authority CEO, said:\n\"Automotive manufacturers are under increasing pressure to demonstrate control over cryptographic integrity, software update provenance and vulnerability response, particularly as they enter and expand into more regulated markets. These customer wins underscore the industry's shift toward OEM-owned key management as a strategic requirement and competitive advantage - not just a technical preference. And the impact of the CRA is coming up more and more, and it is a good thing companies are responding.\"\nAbout Device Authority\nDevice Authority is a global leader in Identity and Access Management (\"IAM\") for the IoT; focused on the automotive, medical device (\"IoMT\") and industrial (\"IIoT\") sectors. Device Authority's KeyScaler\u2122 platform provides zero touch provisioning and complete automated lifecycle management for securing IoT devices and data at scale, with frictionless deployment across device provisioning, authentication, credential management, policy based end-to-end data security/encryption and secure OTA (over the air) and HSM (hardware security module) updates\n.

Tern has been informed that it is to receive substantially nil consideration, either now or at the end of the life of SVV2, in relation to this.\nThe General Partner has also stated that it considers Tern to owe default interest and costs, and additional legal costs amounting to a total of approximately \u00a340,000. The General Partner has also stated that the LPA requires a defaulting investor to indemnify the partnership and the General Partner for losses arising as a consequence of a default, and has quantified its view on the aggregate amount in this respect in relation to the period between 28 November 2025 and 24 February 2032 as approximately \u00a3184,000, although at this stage Tern does not consider that it has had sufficient data to come to its own determination regarding the General Partner's view regarding this deemed amount.\nTern is in the process of taking legal advice in relation to all the above matters and will make further announcements as appropriate.\nEnquiries\nTern Plc\nJane McCracken (Interim Non-Executive Chair)\nvia IFC Advisory\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: 0203 328 5656\nIFC Advisory\n(Financial PR and IR)\nTim Metcalfe\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Staton\nTel: 0203 934 6632\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

If neither an exit nor a relevant fundraising has taken place, the CLNs will mature on 21 November 2029, in line with the approximately \u00a30.3 million of convertible loan notes that the Company already holds in Talking Medicines.\nAs at 30 June 2025, the date of Tern's last published book valuation, Tern's equity and convertible loan note holding in Talking Medicines had a total unaudited book value of \u00a32.1 million. Following the issue of the CLN, Tern's equity holding in Talking Medicines will be unchanged and Tern will continue to hold approximately 23.8% of Talking Medicines' equity, but now with an increased total convertible loan note holding of approximately \u00a30.52 million.\nTalking Medicines is in the process of raising up to \u00a31.0 million of new funding from new and existing investors through the issue of CLNs on the same terms.\nFurther information on Talking Medicines\nTalking Medicines uses Advanced Data Science and Artificial Intelligence to empower healthcare advertising agencies, enabling them to consistently win and retain their Pharma clients whilst achieving improved productivity, with swift project delivery. Talking Medicines is seeking to revolutionise the over US$23bn healthcare advertising market (Research and Markets, Healthcare Advertising Market Report 2025), through unlocking strategic intelligence within conversational data. Talking Medicines empowers customers to gain strategic advantages in analysis, measurement, and enhanced brand equity through structuring conversational data.\nBased on Talking Medicines' latest statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024, as at that date it had net liabilities of approximately \u00a31.4 million and incurred a loss for the year of approximately \u00a30.51 million. Given the historic nature of these figures, Tern does not consider this to be representative of the current business, trading performance and prospects of Talking Medicines.\nEnquiries\nTern Plc\nJane McCracken (Interim Non-Executive Chair)\nvia IFC Advisory\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: 0203 328 5656\nIFC Advisory\n(Financial PR and IR)\nTim Metcalfe\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Staton\nTel: 0203 934 6632\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
