Tern has been informed that it is to receive substantially nil consideration, either now or at the end of the life of SVV2, in relation to this.\nThe General Partner has also stated that it considers Tern to owe default interest and costs, and additional legal costs amounting to a total of approximately \u00a340,000. The General Partner has also stated that the LPA requires a defaulting investor to indemnify the partnership and the General Partner for losses arising as a consequence of a default, and has quantified its view on the aggregate amount in this respect in relation to the period between 28 November 2025 and 24 February 2032 as approximately \u00a3184,000, although at this stage Tern does not consider that it has had sufficient data to come to its own determination regarding the General Partner's view regarding this deemed amount.\nTern is in the process of taking legal advice in relation to all the above matters and will make further announcements as appropriate.\nEnquiries\nTern Plc\nJane McCracken (Interim Non-Executive Chair)\nvia IFC Advisory\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: 0203 328 5656\nIFC Advisory\n(Financial PR and IR)\nTim Metcalfe\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Staton\nTel: 0203 934 6632\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

If neither an exit nor a relevant fundraising has taken place, the CLNs will mature on 21 November 2029, in line with the approximately \u00a30.3 million of convertible loan notes that the Company already holds in Talking Medicines.\nAs at 30 June 2025, the date of Tern's last published book valuation, Tern's equity and convertible loan note holding in Talking Medicines had a total unaudited book value of \u00a32.1 million. Following the issue of the CLN, Tern's equity holding in Talking Medicines will be unchanged and Tern will continue to hold approximately 23.8% of Talking Medicines' equity, but now with an increased total convertible loan note holding of approximately \u00a30.52 million.\nTalking Medicines is in the process of raising up to \u00a31.0 million of new funding from new and existing investors through the issue of CLNs on the same terms.\nFurther information on Talking Medicines\nTalking Medicines uses Advanced Data Science and Artificial Intelligence to empower healthcare advertising agencies, enabling them to consistently win and retain their Pharma clients whilst achieving improved productivity, with swift project delivery. Talking Medicines is seeking to revolutionise the over US$23bn healthcare advertising market (Research and Markets, Healthcare Advertising Market Report 2025), through unlocking strategic intelligence within conversational data. Talking Medicines empowers customers to gain strategic advantages in analysis, measurement, and enhanced brand equity through structuring conversational data.\nBased on Talking Medicines' latest statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024, as at that date it had net liabilities of approximately \u00a31.4 million and incurred a loss for the year of approximately \u00a30.51 million. Given the historic nature of these figures, Tern does not consider this to be representative of the current business, trading performance and prospects of Talking Medicines.\nEnquiries\nTern Plc\nJane McCracken (Interim Non-Executive Chair)\nvia IFC Advisory\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: 0203 328 5656\nIFC Advisory\n(Financial PR and IR)\nTim Metcalfe\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Staton\nTel: 0203 934 6632\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

        "bull_narrative": "Bulls point to the device\u2011authority niche and argue that the recent rights issue could provide the cash needed to accelerate product development and secure early carrier pilots. They see the company as a long\u2011term play if it can land a strategic partner.",
        "bear_narrative": "Bears warn that the company has no revenue, the share price is essentially zero, and the rights issue will only dilute existing shareholders further while adding regulatory scrutiny. They believe the story is too early and too speculative.",

      "attention_check": "Google Trends shows a flat 0/100 interest and no momentum, while social media posts have dropped to zero after the initial announcement.

The device\u2011authority niche is large and growing, and a partnership with a carrier could provide a revenue stream. However, this would require a clear roadmap, a signed pilot, and a credible financial plan.",
      "bear_case": "Without any revenue, a collapsed share price, and a high risk of dilution, the company is likely to continue to underperform. The capital raise may fail or be too small to cover development costs, and the board\u2019s governance shuffle suggests instability. The lack of social buzz and zero Google interest further weaken the case.",
      "risk_reward": "Low risk\u2011reward profile; the upside is speculative and the downside is a near\u2011certain wipe\u2011out of the current equity."

      "if_bullish": "Take a micro\u2011position (0.1\u20130.2% of the portfolio) only if a new investor signs on and a clear revenue roadmap is published. Use a tight stop at 0.02p to limit losses. Add on only after the AGM confirms a successful rights issue and the company announces a pilot or partnership. Stay within a 10% risk envelope.",
      "if_watching": "Hold off until the AGM outcome and the completion of the rights issue. Wait for a concrete product launch or a partnership announcement before committing any capital. Watch for any regulatory filings that could indicate a pivot or a strategic shift. If the company fails to secure additional capital, consider exiting or reducing exposure.",
      "if_passing": "Avoid the trade. The lack of traction, zero social buzz, and the high dilution risk make the story too speculative for a micro\u2011cap trader. The share is essentially a lottery ticket with no clear catalyst, and the risk of a total wipe\u2011out outweighs any potential upside."
