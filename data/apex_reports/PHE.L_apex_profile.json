As part of working towards this, NH2 has also received a signed Offer to Lease from the Western Australian Government for up to 50 years, for a strategically located and appropriately zoned site which is large enough to accommodate two of Powerhouse's patented Distributed Modular Generation (\"DMG\") trains in the Rockingham Strategic Industrial Area, just south of Perth.\nThe project being delivered is expected to be undertaken in a phased approach as outlined below:\n\u00b7\nPhase 1 - Construction of a single ~40 Tonne per Day (\"TPD\") train DMG producing power\n\u00b7\nPhase 2 - the initial ~40 TPD single train will have a pre-deigned Hydrogen separation and compression unit added to allow Hydrogen production as the hydrogen market grows for heavy transport solutions\n\u00b7\nPhase 3 - Construction of a second ~40 TPD DMG train.\nNational Waste to Energy has also completed a power offtake agreement with the largest independent commercial energy provider in Perth and wider Western Australia. In addition, National Waste to Energy has secured a feedstock agreement for sorted mixed plastics with a company that has very significant experience in the waste management business.\nPHE are also supporting NH2 with the provision of technical documentation such as Patents, FEED package, license agreements etc, for a large UK based, international commercial finance company currently undertaking financial due diligence on the project.\nAs this is a client driven project, the Company is working to their timescales and will provide further updates as they are available.\nPaul Emmitt, Chief Executive Officer of Powerhouse, commented:\n\"The creation of the SPV, the signed Offer to Lease and the progression of funding are significant steps forward in our collaboration with National Hydrogen and a further huge endorsement of our DMG process.

The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nPowerhouse Energy Group plc\n(\"Powerhouse\" or the \"Company\")\nFeedstock Testing Unit update\nPowerhouse Energy Group plc (AIM: PHE),\u00a0a company pioneering integrated technology that converts non-recyclable waste into low carbon energy with a revenue generating engineering consulting division (\"Engsolve\"), is pleased to provide the following update on its Feedstock Testing Unit (\"FTU\"). In the six months since the Company held its Capital Markets Day, the PHE team has been actively testing, validating, and refining the DMG system. Initial trials, using raw plastics, have delivered excellent results that were consistent (and in certain cases, better) with both our model predictions and previous small-scale tests.\nTesting has now progressed to mixed plastics in raw and \"real\" waste forms which have also aligned well with our models and, encouragingly, showed slightly higher hydrogen content in the resulting syngas than anticipated. The next phase of testing involved improving the efficiency of the downstream systems and optimising the DMG temperature profile.\nFollowing these tests, PHE has installed a custom made and designed internal plate system within the furnace, developed using Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling work carried out in collaboration with Manchester University. Upon installation, and repeating the earlier tests, the Company recorded improved heat retention within the kiln and a significant reduction in residue carryover to the gas clean-up system. This design will now be implemented into all future DMG units.\nWith the design enhancements, the R&D team has also tested solid recovered fuel (SRF) and mixed plastics (mixed in accordance with the specification provided for the National Hydrogen Australian project). The SRF results were as expected, given this type of feedstock lends itself more towards producing a syngas to power, or a precursor syngas product rather than a for a Hydrogen project. The mixed plastics however, provided a repeatable Hydrogen content in the syngas at the top end of the model prediction. This not only reinforces our confidence in the currently published figures, but also indicates that, with the appropriate feedstock mix, PHE has the potential to exceed them.\nIn this regard, as an example, PHE has previously stated that from a 40 Tonnes per Day (TPD) mixed plastic input that the DMG would produce approx. 2.5 to 3.0TPD of Hydrogen. The Company is now confident that between 3.0 and 3.5 TPD can be produced at 99.999% purity with a higher output possible if producing to the lower purity ISO road transport standard.\nWhile the testing to date has been extremely positive, the team continues to optimise the commercial system design through ongoing FTU testing. This includes running various \"real-life\" waste streams for potential clients and experimenting with different operating conditions to tailor syngas composition for applications beyond hydrogen production. In parallel, the testing is informing efforts to valorise the residue stream, further enhancing the overall commercial viability of the DMG offering.\nPaul Emmitt, Chief Executive Officer of PHE, commented:\n\"The progress we've made with our Feedstock Testing Unit over the past six months is a testament to the ingenuity and dedication of the Powerhouse team. The validation of our DMG system with both native and mixed waste plastics-especially the higher-than-expected hydrogen yields-reinforces our confidence in the technology and its commercial potential. The design enhancements, developed in collaboration with Manchester University, mark a significant step forward in efficiency and scalability. As we continue to optimise the system and explore diverse feedstocks, we are not only advancing our hydrogen production capabilities but also unlocking new pathways for sustainable energy and waste valorisation.\"\n-ENDS-\nFor more information, contact\n:\nPowerhouse Energy Group Plc\nPaul Emmitt, CEO\n+44 (0) 203 368 6399\nBen Brier, CFO\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / Rob Patrick / James Harris\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n(Broker)\nStuart Gledhill / Adam Cowl\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nTavistock\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 207 920 3150\nSimon Hudson / Nick Elwes\npowerhouse@tavistock.co.uk\nAbout Powerhouse Energy Group Plc\nPowerhouse Energy has developed a process technology which can util",

Holdings Limited (\"BSH\"), whereby PHE will be the exclusive supplier of Hydrogen (at 99.999% purity) to BSH's proposed Fuel Cell (Penta) H2P project in Ballymena, Northern Ireland.\nB.S. Holdings Limited is a trademarked UK company which specialises in design, design build and engineering, with a particular focus on hydrogen EHC (electro chemical hydrogen compressor) and H2P (Hydrogen to power). BSH also has a patent pending on a fuel cell hydrogen generation unit named Penta and engaged with Powerhouse as a potential energy supplier in the region.\nThe terms of quantity and duration are subject to agreement with DESNZ, Ecotricity, SONI and NIE Networks. G\niven that this is a FOAK (first of a kind) development project underwritten by DESNZ, PHE would supply Hydrogen at a price lower than that of both Green Hydrogen and the current UK CfD strike price.\nPHE will also assist BSH in other Penta (Combined Heat and Power) CHP projects within the Mid and East Antrim Council region requiring hydrogen (noting that PHE is a commercial entity), subject to a battery limit of the production site. PHE, using Multiple Element Gas Containers (MEGC) trailers for storage, would be open in future to negotiate the facility to utilise the MEGC trailers for fuel deliveries to MEA council supported projects, in doing so supporting the council's drive for net zero and, in particular, net zero manufacturing.\nBSH will aid PHE with sourcing further commercial clients, introductions to local companies and provide the Company with priority access to any future project / developments in which it is involved within NI and the wider UK.\nFurther updates will be provided in due course.\nPaul Emmitt, Chief Executive Officer of PHE, commented\n:\n\"This is a first of its kind agreement and we are delighted to have entered into the LoI with BSH for this potential DESNZ backed project. One of the key issues holding back the increased utilisation of hydrogen has been gaining appropriate offtake agreements. This LoI has the potential to deliver that for our Ballymena project.\nWe look forward to working with the BSH team to complete this agreement and hopefully working together in Northern Ireland.\"\nBrian Hood,\nChief Executive Officer\nof BSH, commented\n:\n\"Without the fuel, the projects will not float, too many times we see great ideas and advances falter because of inadequacy of fuel and fuel at a sensible price. We also recognise that Powerhouses raw material use is a circular economy piece needed across the world. We are delighted to have reached this agreement and look forward to working alongside them in the delivery of the project.\nOur FOAK has the potential to display to the industry an improved way of zero emission delivery for electricity use, controlling electricity wastage, not turning off with curtailment. By turning it into a green gas, then using it in our power stations, when the wind ceases, or as is frequently in Ireland with PV, a cloudy rain soaked dark day with no generation, we reuse the transmission line which is unused, now available and generate to the grid.\"\nFor more information, contact\n:\nPowerhouse Energy Group Plc\nPaul Emmitt, CEO +44 (0) 203 368 6399\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / James Harris / Rob Patrick +44 (0) 207 409 3494\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n(Broker)\nStuart Gledhill / Adam Cowl +44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nTavistock\n(Financial PR)\nSimon Hudson / Nick Elwes +44 (0) 207 920 3150\npowerhouse@tavistock.co.uk\nBS Holdings Ltd\nBrian Hood, CEO +44 (0) 2890 732 233\nAbout Powerhouse Energy Group Plc\nPowerhouse Energy has developed a process technology which can utilise waste plastic, end-of-life-tyres, and other waste streams to convert them efficiently and economically into syngas from which valuable products such as chemical precursors, hydrogen, electricity, heat and other industrial products may be derived.

Given the level of demand, where the order was greater than the soft pre-emptive allowance shareholders received approximately 23 per cent. of their additional demand1.\nAccordingly, conditional on the admission of the Placing Shares and Retail Offer Shares, the Company has raised total gross proceeds of approximately \u00a31.375 million in aggregate.\nPaul Emmitt, Chief Executive Officer of PHE, commented:\n\"I would like to thank all investors for their continued support at this pivotal time for the Company. The funds raised through this offer and the recent placing will enable us to increase momentum across our current project pipeline, driving forward our business with a view to generating additional revenue streams through innovation.\n\"With the FTU now up and running, and enquiries coming in about its capabilities, this is a highly exciting time for the business and we look forward to providing further updates in due course.\"\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Placing Shares and the Retail Offer Shares, being a total of 275,000,000 new Ordinary Shares, to trading on AIM. It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings in the Placing Shares and the Retail Offer Shares will commence on AIM at 8.00 a.m. on or around 28 March 2025 (\"\nAdmission\n\").\nThe Placing Shares and Retail Offer Shares will be issued fully paid and will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company in issue will be 4,471,654,741, all with voting rights. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company's share capital pursuant to the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n1\nSoft Pre-emptive allowance Calculation: Existing shares X approximately 6.553% (Dilution from total new shares being issued) = Soft Pre-emptive allowance shares. Soft Pre-emptive allowance shares X 100% = Soft Pre-emptive allowance allocated shares. Additional demand allocation share calculation: (Total order shares - Soft pre-emptive allowance allocation shares) X approximately 23%.\nCapitalised terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the announcement released by the Company on 14 March 2025 at 5.15 p.m., unless the context requires otherwise.\n\u200b\nFor more information, contact:\nPowerhouse Energy Group Plc\nPaul Emmitt, CEO\n+44 (0) 203 368 6399\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / Rob Patrick / James Harris\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Broker)\nS",

Avioxx, based in London and Cheshire, has developed a patented process to produce SAF from non-recyclable wastes.\nUnder the proposed collaboration, PHE will work with Avioxx on its pilot scale facility, Project Eden, which is expected to produce 200 tonnes per annum of SAF. The companies are currently investigating the potential of PHE providing two 2.5 tonne per day gasification trains to supply the raw syngas to feed the facility. The 2.5 tonne per day units are based upon the Powerhouse's Feedstock Testing Unit at the Company's Technical Centre in Bridgend. These units will be sold to Avioxx, with a potential service agreement going forward between PHE and Avioxx. The integration of the two companies' patented technologies is illustrated in the 3D rendering shown in the figure below.\nPHE sees this as an important route to a lower carbon future and the Company's patented DMG (Distributed Modular Generation) is ideal for the smaller scale facilities and will allow its viability as a supplier of Syngas to large scale SAF facilities to be assessed.\nProject Eden is still in the development phase and more information about the project and Avioxx can be found at\nhttps://www.avioxx.co.uk/project-eden-200-TPA-modular-plant.html\nDetails of the Powerhouse Energy Group DMG can be found at\nwww.phegroup.com\nPaul Emmitt, Chief Executive Officer of Powerhouse, commented:\n\"We are delighted to be collaborating with Avioxx. This is a highly significant development for the Company as it further shows the potential of our technology and its adaptability to be able to service a wide number of industries. SAF has huge potential for us and is a sector that undoubtedly can benefit from using our technology to provide cleaner fuels for the aviation industry.\n\"We look forward to working with the Avioxx team in progressing Project Eden and providing further updates in due course.\"\nChris Hancock, Chief Executive Officer of Avioxx, commented:\n\"Effectively harnessing the valuable molecules from waste is key to achieving a genuine circular economy and delivering economical, sustainable fuel for the aviation sector. We hope the Powerhouse technology will be the first, and most important stage of the process to transform waste to highly valuable fuel. Integration of electrochemistry allows us to dramatically improve the production efficiency of the Jet A1 kerosine.

          "full_content": "11 Mar 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 2436G\nPowerhouse Energy Group PLC\n11 March 2024\n11 March 2024\nPowerhouse Energy Group plc\n(\"Powerhouse\", \"PHE\" or the \"Company\")\nUpdate on Longford Project JV\nSigning of Joint Venture with Hydrogen Utopia International Plc for the development of a non-recyclable Waste Plastic to Hydrogen facility in the Republic of Ireland (the \"Longford Project\")\nPowerhouse Energy Group Plc (AIM: PHE), a company pioneering integrated technology which converts non-recyclable waste into low carbon energy, refers to its announcement of 30 October 2023. That announcement advised that the Company had decided to defer further progress towards committing to the Longford Project whilst it took stock of the final position in its negotiations with Hydrogen Utopia International Plc (LON: HUI) (\"HUI\") for the proposed joint development of a non-recyclable plastic waste-to-hydrogen facility site at Longford, County Longford in the Republic of Ireland.\nPowerhouse is now pleased to report the following developments:\n(1) Powerhouse and its subsidiary, Powerhouse Energy International Limited (\"PHE International\") have entered into a subscription and shareholder agreement (the \"Subscription and Shareholder Agreement\") with HUI and its Irish subsidiaries, Alister Future Technologies Limited (\"AFT\") and Eranova Longford Limited (\"Eranova\") in connection with the building of a waste plastic to hydrogen plant on a greenfield site at Fisherstown Energy Park in County Longford, Ireland; and\n(2) AFT, PHE International, HUI and Mashup PLC (previously called Fisherstown Property Holdings Limited) (\"FPHL\") have agreed to amend and restate the option agreement dated 10 March 2023 entered into between Eranova and FPHL, pursuant to which FPHL (as freeholder of the land on which the Longford Project would be developed) granted an option to Eranova to lease the site for 25 years (\"the Option For Lease\"). Up to ?150,000 is payable by Eranova to FPHL under the Option For Lease, with the timing for payment dependent on the date on which planning permission for the Longford Project is obtained.\nUnder the amended terms of the Subscription and Shareholder Agreement, AFT and PHE International will now each own 50% of Eranova and development costs will be contributed to on a 50:50 basis. Eranova will be the developer of the Longford Project, and each party will have the right to appoint up to two members to the board of Eranova.\nInitial financing is being provided by AFT and PHE International by way of shareholder loans (for a maximum of ?200,000 each) under separate loan agreements. Any future financing will be raised in accordance with the Subscription and Shareholder Agreement through further loans or (with the consent of the shareholders only) subscription for shares.\nSigning of the Subscription and Shareholder Agreement requires PHE to make an immediate payment of \u00a3100,000 to HUI. This is in addition to the \u00a3100,000 already paid to HUI, as noted in the Company's announcement on 21 March 2023. A further payment of \u00a3100,000 in cash will also be made to HUI once planning permission has been granted for the Longford Project.\nUnder the terms agreed between the parties, FPHL has also been granted an option to acquire shares in Eranova (the \"FPHL Shares Option\"). Under the terms of the FPHL Shares Option, FPHL may, within 10 days of anticipated financial closure of the Longford Project or anticipated commencement of construction of the Longford Project, exercise an option for the transfer or subscription by it of new shares in Eranova. On exercise of the FPHL Shares Option, this would result in FPHL becoming the holder of non-voting shares amounting to 5% of the issued share capital of Eranova. The exercise of the FPHL Option would result in an equal dilution of the shareholdings of AFT and PHE International.\nLongford, a county in the Irish Midlands, is anticipated to be one of the prime beneficiaries of the EU Just Transition Fund in Ireland. On 29 November 2022, Irish Government approval was given for Ireland's Territorial Just Transition Plan and its associated programme for the period to 2027, which will provide ?169 million of funding in the Irish Midlands; the Irish Government plan was adopted by the European Commission on 15 December 2022.\nThe Company sees this project as an opportunity to progress a project within a European Union Just Transition Fund area, which brings with it the potential of grant funding for the development. The next phase will be the developing the application for planning and permitting on the site and overall management of the project, which will be carried out by the JV company, Eranova.\nPowerhouse looks forward to working closely with HUI to deliver this project successfully, fostering innovation and creating a positive impact on the global hydrogen landscape. Further updates will be provided as and when appropriate, with the immediate focus now being on securing planning permission.\nPaul Emmitt, Chie",

However, due to undefined timescales to date from the Liquidator; PHE has now placed orders for an alternative kiln, a new gas clean-up system and the required balance of plant which allows the Engsolve team to complete the works on PHE's behalf. PHE is now targeting early Q4 2024 for the installation of the equipment at the Company's technology centre, but will continue to work on reducing this timeline.\nThe Company also shortly expects to move the test kiln from Cheshire into this building.\nEuropean Patent Claim:\nFurther to the Company's 6 February 2024 RNS, PHE continues to defend the patent claim brought against the Company by Onunda Ltd. The Company can confirm that it is continuing to pursue commercial projects, whilst this matter is worked through by its legal counsel. The Board remains confident in its position and that a satisfactory outcome will be achieved, without delaying commercial progress.\nPHE has developed and continues to develop an additional significant and valuable body of intellectual property; the exploitation of which PHE continues to discuss with its commercial partners with a view of bringing PHE's innovative technical solutions to the market.\nEngsolve Ltd\nDuring last year, PHE acquired the entire shareholding of Engsolve, which enabled the Company to secure the proprietary knowledge of the DMG technology that was held within Engsolve, and which had been gained over the past six years by the team. In addition to this, the acquisition provided a ready-made engineering capacity that allowed PHE to diversify its revenue structure through gaining access to more stages in the project lifecycle i.e., Feasibility studies, FEED and Owners / Developers Engineer, and Engsolve longstanding client base.\nThe strategy is now to grow Engsolve independently, whilst still providing the required support to PHE.\nPaul Emmitt, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"2023 was a transitional year for Powerhouse where we dealt with several issues that were out of PHE's control, whilst seeing us get our house in order and setting the foundations from which to build and grow the Company going forward. There were a number of changes implemented both to the team, included my own appointment, and the way that PHE will continue to develop its business.\n\"We have a number of exciting projects which we are looking to develop and have bought Engsolve into the fold which will diversify our revenues and give us access to a number of new potential partners.

The government has committed to providing the necessary support and investment to facilitate this transition, including a \u00a32.3 billion investment package to boost manufacturing of zero-emission vehicles. The mandate also includes exemptions for small and micro-volume manufacturers like McLaren and Aston Martin, preserving iconic British brands.

Plasma technology ( InEnTech),  has temperatures exceeding 2000dC, and more heat 'breaks down' more difficult plastics to gasify. The Company that PHE bought out 12 + years ago initially used plasma arcing to gasify plastics,  and PHE changed this to Pyrolysis. The website of PHE up until only a few years ago, still mentioned in its Forward, that the operation was Plasma. !!! The obvious big red flag with Plasma Gasification is energy costs. Electric Plasma torched consume Mw of energy. The reason I believe Hui and InEnTech see the ME as athe market for H2 from Plasma is the energy source. Electricity from Oil.  Oil is cheaper than water in many Gulf countries, and, because these countries 'enjoy' long days of Sun, Solar Power can also be a cost effective power source. There are many detractors of a H2 economy, with some justification, but I believe that most countries are aware ( with the exception of Trumps USA),  that the days of Fossil Fuel are numbered, and diversification is seen as prudent. I am sure that Engsolve could 'get up to speed' on Plasma technology, but I believe Plasma Tech is a no go in Eu and many parts of the World because of the high energy demand.",

What has surprised us most is the sheer scale of the shortage - far greater than we ever anticipated. Even more striking is the widespread lack of understanding about what SAF is and how it is fundamentally reshaping global air travel. The growth potential is extraordinary, with a CAGR of over 40% projected over the next five years, and strong momentum sustained over the next 20 years. I have recorded an interview with Zak Mir, to be released today, to explain why so many still fail to grasp its impact.. You can see H W goes to HUI form the lasted HUI RNS. loads",

At present, the only deal with any potential is Wrightbus; however PHE have also been very clear that they do not intend to build and own their own sites. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to see how PHE would even be the party securing project finance.

We have opportunities for Project funding and as Ballymena has the necessary commercial criteria, feedstock offtake, local authority support etc to allow Powerhouse to seek project funding that will give us greater project control and allow the project to be delivered in a more favourable timescale for the business\" And here\u2019s 2 external funding avenues, based on that wording. Venture Capital (VC) & Angel Investors: Provide significant capital in exchange for an equity stake (ownership) in the business, often with the added benefit of mentorship and industry connections.

Without checking the exact figures, cash at the bank was  circa \u00a31.4m in the bank in June and cash burn was around \u00a34.7 the year before. PHE salaries are about \u00a3500k year + pensions and some large expenses alone.  All paid to Directors, as PHE only employ Directors!! Castle, yes I've made a near 50% loss, and bought else where, fortunately making decent money along the way.  I posted on here when I sold and how much I lost, so what's your point? You've no back bone castle and are too scared to hit the sell button, as it means admitting what a mistake you've made here, all the way down from 9p FFS!!! If you'd taken my advice and sold this, invested in HUI, taken the profits, you'd have 3 or 4 times the shares in PHE you have now. Happy days buddy",

Plasma technology ( InEnTech),  has temperatures exceeding 2000dC, and more heat 'breaks down' more difficult plastics to gasify. The Company that PHE bought out 12 + years ago initially used plasma arcing to gasify plastics,  and PHE changed this to Pyrolysis. The website of PHE up until only a few years ago, still mentioned in its Forward, that the operation was Plasma. !!! The obvious big red flag with Plasma Gasification is energy costs. Electric Plasma torched consume Mw of energy. The reason I believe Hui and InEnTech see the ME as athe market for H2 from Plasma is the energy source. Electricity from Oil.  Oil is cheaper than water in many Gulf countries, and, because these countries 'enjoy' long days of Sun, Solar Power can also be a cost effective power source. There are many detractors of a H2 economy, with some justification, but I believe that most countries are aware ( with the exception of Trumps USA),  that the days of Fossil Fuel are numbered, and diversification is seen as prudent. I am sure that Engsolve could 'get up to speed' on Plasma technology, but I believe Plasma Tech is a no go in Eu and many parts of the World because of the high energy demand.",

Even more striking is the widespread lack of understanding about what SAF is and how it is fundamentally reshaping global air travel. The growth potential is extraordinary, with a CAGR of over 40% projected over the next five years, and strong momentum sustained over the next 20 years. I have recorded an interview with Zak Mir, to be released today, to explain why so many still fail to grasp its impact.. You can see H W goes to HUI form the lasted HUI RNS. loads",

An AI search of Hertfordshire Uni for year 2019 ( the year of your alleged PhD shows zero results for a Robert ( Bob)) Smith. One of the most common names in the English speaking World and could also be fake. ? lol. Y our continued reference to my BP ( formerly British Petroleum)  share purchase ( through an intermediary) some 50 years ago shows you inability to understand Google results.  You quite rightly said that BP was Govt owned, but only 51%. The 49% retained by Share Holders was traded on LSM, and indeed, was the mainstay of many pension funds.  You are a fool and only strengthens arguments against you holding any qualifications in business related subjects. ( eg your fake PhD). You do not understand how business work.  And, you are unemployed. You have never mentioned your employment history. !!  BTW. You had to go back through over 2000 of my posts to find the post about BP share buying. You are a very sad person. You have changed your avatar twice now in the past year, and all your previous posting history has gone. Afraid I might look through them and find more BS from you.? I have better things to doo, fool.",

These processes are usually confidential until something is sufficiently advanced to announce. If this were simply a fund raise, the company would normally say so. The fact they\u2019ve framed it as strategic rather than transactional suggests something more than short term working capital. Agreed that, until capital or contracts are actually announced,  non delivery is the key risk.",

They categorically stated they did not need to raise funds, when in reality the raise had already been lined up. If they're forced down the retail avenue , investors would by necessity need notice in order to participate. At present, the only deal with any potential is Wrightbus; however PHE have also been very clear that they do not intend to build and own their own sites. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to see how PHE would even be the party securing project finance. If the plant is being built for a paying customer, logic dictates that the customer would apply for and secure the project finance, not PHE. That's the way I see it and feel the evidence is points.",

The government has committed to providing the necessary support and investment to facilitate this transition, including a \u00a32.3 billion investment package to boost manufacturing of zero-emission vehicles. The mandate also includes exemptions for small and micro-volume manufacturers like McLaren and Aston Martin, preserving iconic British brands.

Plasma technology ( InEnTech),  has temperatures exceeding 2000dC, and more heat 'breaks down' more difficult plastics to gasify. The Company that PHE bought out 12 + years ago initially used plasma arcing to gasify plastics,  and PHE changed this to Pyrolysis. The website of PHE up until only a few years ago, still mentioned in its Forward, that the operation was Plasma. !!! The obvious big red flag with Plasma Gasification is energy costs. Electric Plasma torched consume Mw of energy. The reason I believe Hui and InEnTech see the ME as athe market for H2 from Plasma is the energy source. Electricity from Oil.  Oil is cheaper than water in many Gulf countries, and, because these countries 'enjoy' long days of Sun, Solar Power can also be a cost effective power source. There are many detractors of a H2 economy, with some justification, but I believe that most countries are aware ( with the exception of Trumps USA),  that the days of Fossil Fuel are numbered, and diversification is seen as prudent. I am sure that Engsolve could 'get up to speed' on Plasma technology, but I believe Plasma Tech is a no go in Eu and many parts of the World because of the high energy demand.",

Even more striking is the widespread lack of understanding about what SAF is and how it is fundamentally reshaping global air travel. The growth potential is extraordinary, with a CAGR of over 40% projected over the next five years, and strong momentum sustained over the next 20 years.

On the cover of the Forbes Middle East edition, Mr Ali Al Dhaheri of Tadweer Group is quoted as saying: \"The waste sector is underrated\u2026 If we look at what can be done with it, it becomes a resource.\" That statement resonates deeply with the vision we at Hydrogen Utopia International have been pursuing for years. And yet, such recognition has been largely absent from European leadership. For too long, we have faced significant barriers, even with world-class partners, Electron, Linde, and Sweco, working alongside us, as Europe repeatedly hesitated to deploy technologies capable of transforming unrecyclable waste into hydrogen. The EU's declarations of decarbonisation have often remained aspirational rather than actionable. The Just Transition Fund and Mechanism, intended to support decarbonisation and job creation, have fallen short. Hydrogen costs in Europe, ranging between \u20ac5 and \u20ac15 per kilogram, remain unsustainably high. While Europe speaks of abandoning fossil fuels and scaling hydrogen, practical pathways have yet to be followed. Meanwhile, the Gulf States, often misunderstood as \"petrol economies,\" are driving rapid and meaningful progress. In the GCC, waste-to-hydrogen is embraced as \"super green hydrogen,\" and innovation is rewarded rather than blocked by strangling bureaucracy. Europe has yet to recognise what the Gulf already understands: this is the future. The situation in Europe is stark. Incinerators continue to be built, illegal landfills proliferate, Poland alone has an estimated 400-750, and recycling facilities are closing under operational and economic pressures. Blue Cycle in the Netherlands, Biffa in the UK, Veolia in Germany, all shutting down. Borealis, Dow, Neste are abandoning projects. Recycling, as it has been practiced, has proven insufficient. The only way forward is a true circular economy, where waste hydrocarbons are being transformed into clean energy and destroyed efficiently, cleanly, and economically. Europe will inevitably rely on hydrogen imports from the Middle East and North Africa, bound by the consequences of inaction.. loads",

I actually don't think you have much of an investment, because if you did, you'd have a more constructive POV! Anyone using catchy phrases like, 'you don't lose money until you sell' are in denial. Your shares are worth what they're worth today unfortunately; less if here's more dilution or a consolidation around the corner.",

For what it's worth, we're an outdoors family, mainly mountain biking, kayaking and surfing.  If we want to camp near a river or beach we will thanks! It's quality family time and everyone loves it.  We also spent 10 days Skiing in British Columbia over Christmas with family from Ontario.  Can't imagine you on  the slopes for some reason!! How's Poland. Spain and Sharm treating you, same places every year, yeah? LMFAO.",

I assume autism was referenced \u2014 classy, as ever. If this project goes ahead, it\u2019s entirely reliant on third parties: investors and, crucially, an off-take agreement. This won't work unless there's a pre-established market for 3.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day. To raise funding, they will need far more than a letter of intent \u2014 they\u2019ll need a binding contract. Timescales are another major issue. With Wrightbus and others increasing hydrogen demand, can they realistically wait years PHE to build a facility, or will they be forced to source hydrogen elsewhere? And if that happens, where does it leave PHE? That\u2019s before you even get to planning. No idea how long that will take \u2014 and let\u2019s hope the neighbours don\u2019t object to the noise and traffic. Didn\u2019t that become a problem in Bridgend with the 2.5-tonne unit?

Funding Strategy: Unlike their usual \"capital-light\" licensing model, PHE plans to secure project finance for the Ballymena plant due to favourable local conditions, including potential support from the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Partnerships & Subsidies: The project is aligned with the regional hydrogen hub ambitions, working with stakeholders such as Wrightbus and Translink. The project is also linked to a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) development underwritten by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). Government Support: The project falls within the scope of UK government initiatives, such as the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) and Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), which support green hydrogen production.",

Namely, because it classed green hydrogen as including pyrolysis and gasification which, in the industry, it clearly is not. From memory, I think they stated a 40tpd DMG unit would bring in around \u00a312m per year in revenue. Happy to be corrected on that though. What is happening now is typical AIM cogs within AIM cogs, and all of them awaiting hoped for funding from third parties to move forward, if not to stay afloat. It's worth remembering that it takes on average 3 to 9 months to secure funding through companies such as Longspur Capital once started. So they shall be busy trying to secure revenue for Powerhouse from their \u00a3980 per month rented seats down in London ( yes, my research does go that far). All of those being tapped for money shall be doing their due diligence and asking the questions that I have been asking all along and which were covered by Dustyslay's overview regarding gasification and pyrolysis in general in his post on the weekend just gone. All the best.",

LOL I can\u2019t see exactly what was said, but he has a habit of grinding people down until it somehow becomes your fault and you\u2019re expected to apologise for existing. I assume autism was referenced \u2014 classy, as ever. If this project goes ahead, it\u2019s entirely reliant on third parties: investors and, crucially, an off-take agreement. This won't work unless there's a pre-established market for 3.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day. To raise funding, they will need far more than a letter of intent \u2014 they\u2019ll need a binding contract. Timescales are another major issue. With Wrightbus and others increasing hydrogen demand, can they realistically wait years PHE to build a facility, or will they be forced to source hydrogen elsewhere? And if that happens, where does it leave PHE? That\u2019s before you even get to planning. No idea how long that will take \u2014 and let\u2019s hope the neighbours don\u2019t object to the noise and traffic. Didn\u2019t that become a problem in Bridgend with the 2.5-tonne unit?

While the project is a commercial development rather than a direct recipient of public grant funding, it is positioned to benefit from UK hydrogen subsidies and strategic partnerships within the region. Funding Strategy: Unlike their usual \"capital-light\" licensing model, PHE plans to secure project finance for the Ballymena plant due to favourable local conditions, including potential support from the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Partnerships & Subsidies: The project is aligned with the regional hydrogen hub ambitions, working with stakeholders such as Wrightbus and Translink. The project is also linked to a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) development underwritten by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). Government Support: The project falls within the scope of UK government initiatives, such as the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) and Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), which support green hydrogen production.",

Namely, because it classed green hydrogen as including pyrolysis and gasification which, in the industry, it clearly is not. From memory, I think they stated a 40tpd DMG unit would bring in around \u00a312m per year in revenue. Happy to be corrected on that though. What is happening now is typical AIM cogs within AIM cogs, and all of them awaiting hoped for funding from third parties to move forward, if not to stay afloat. It's worth remembering that it takes on average 3 to 9 months to secure funding through companies such as Longspur Capital once started. So they shall be busy trying to secure revenue for Powerhouse from their \u00a3980 per month rented seats down in London ( yes, my research does go that far). All of those being tapped for money shall be doing their due diligence and asking the questions that I have been asking all along and which were covered by Dustyslay's overview regarding gasification and pyrolysis in general in his post on the weekend just gone.

I\u2019ll just add in some info from AI so I don\u2019t get it wrong and all LSE police come out in force\u2026 Powerhouse Energy Group (PHE) is advancing a waste-to-hydrogen facility at the former Michelin tyre production site in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. The project aims to convert non-recyclable waste into hydrogen, electricity, and heat using their patented Distributed Modular Generation (DMG\u00ae) technology. Key Project Details: Location: Silverwood Business Park, Ballymena (former Michelin site). Site Area: Approximately 1.98 acres. Capacity: The facility is designed to convert 40 tonnes per day of non-recyclable waste. Technology: Uses PHE\u2019s proprietary DMG\u00ae technology to produce hydrogen and power. Status: As of late January/early February 2026, Powerhouse Energy has submitted a full planning application and is moving ahead with permitting. Lease Agreement: A 25-year lease for the site was signed, including a 12-month rent-free period. Strategic Importance: The site was chosen for its available infrastructure, local feedstock, and support from local councils, aimed at aiding Northern Ireland's decarbonisation targets. This project is part of a \"design-build-operate\" model, with Powerhouse seeking project-specific finance. The facility is intended to be a low-emission, low-impact, and self-sufficient solution.",

If Engsolve carries out the FEED work in house, it\u2019s cheaper than farming it out and gives much clearer cost and risk definition re its experience with DMG. That reduces uncertainty for external funders and makes funding easier to price, which is why I see a better than even chance (around 60\u201370%) of funding being secured. The remaining question isn\u2019t whether funding happens its all down to how its structured and that\u2019s the adviser\u2019s job (Longspur). We know the technology works at 2.5tpd . A x16 scale up is all about confidence and determination. we can't afford to wait for AUS and the pipeline will only come onboard after 40tpd results.",

I assume autism was referenced \u2014 classy, as ever. If this project goes ahead, it\u2019s entirely reliant on third parties: investors and, crucially, an off-take agreement. This won't work unless there's a pre-established market for 3.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day. To raise funding, they will need far more than a letter of intent \u2014 they\u2019ll need a binding contract. Timescales are another major issue. With Wrightbus and others increasing hydrogen demand, can they realistically wait years PHE to build a facility, or will they be forced to source hydrogen elsewhere? And if that happens, where does it leave PHE? That\u2019s before you even get to planning. No idea how long that will take \u2014 and let\u2019s hope the neighbours don\u2019t object to the noise and traffic. Didn\u2019t that become a problem in Bridgend with the 2.5-tonne unit?

While the project is a commercial development rather than a direct recipient of public grant funding, it is positioned to benefit from UK hydrogen subsidies and strategic partnerships within the region. Funding Strategy: Unlike their usual \"capital-light\" licensing model, PHE plans to secure project finance for the Ballymena plant due to favourable local conditions, including potential support from the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Partnerships & Subsidies: The project is aligned with the regional hydrogen hub ambitions, working with stakeholders such as Wrightbus and Translink. The project is also linked to a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) development underwritten by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). Government Support: The project falls within the scope of UK government initiatives, such as the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) and Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), which support green hydrogen production.",

Namely, because it classed green hydrogen as including pyrolysis and gasification which, in the industry, it clearly is not. From memory, I think they stated a 40tpd DMG unit would bring in around \u00a312m per year in revenue. Happy to be corrected on that though. What is happening now is typical AIM cogs within AIM cogs, and all of them awaiting hoped for funding from third parties to move forward, if not to stay afloat. It's worth remembering that it takes on average 3 to 9 months to secure funding through companies such as Longspur Capital once started. So they shall be busy trying to secure revenue for Powerhouse from their \u00a3980 per month rented seats down in London ( yes, my research does go that far). All of those being tapped for money shall be doing their due diligence and asking the questions that I have been asking all along and which were covered by Dustyslay's overview regarding gasification and pyrolysis in general in his post on the weekend just gone. All the best.",

Can't say I see this holding 0.004 by the end of the week.  Castle's already down on all of those purchases from last week!!!",

The 'lie' then is an exaggeration, I said 50 yrs in a post some few years ago, which you had to trawl through a few thousand of my posts to read. Idiot.  Ok so it was 48 years.  My point was I bought BP shares in the late 70's, and you said that was a lie because it was nationalised, and I couldn't have bought it. You are a moron. You do not understand what a Google search says. Now please confess  it was possible to buy BP in the late 70's. You are not a man, so you will not. And, btw,  it was you who said your thesis was rejected on account of plagiarism. I could go back through your old posts and find it, couldn't I. ?. Oh no I can't, they have all been deleted from your previous life as DrAnomoly, along with all the posts of your second reincarnation H2hooo. But, unlike you, I have a memory.  So are you denying now that you stated your work was rejected because of plagiarism. ?.  That right, fool, you can't reply because you think it's a waste of time. But going through a few thousand of my old posts wasn't. You are addled pal. You are the projectionist, a pathological liar, and deflect at every opportunity.  beaten you hands down old bean.

I\u2019ll just add in some info from AI so I don\u2019t get it wrong and all LSE police come out in force\u2026 Powerhouse Energy Group (PHE) is advancing a waste-to-hydrogen facility at the former Michelin tyre production site in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. The project aims to convert non-recyclable waste into hydrogen, electricity, and heat using their patented Distributed Modular Generation (DMG\u00ae) technology. Key Project Details: Location: Silverwood Business Park, Ballymena (former Michelin site). Site Area: Approximately 1.98 acres. Capacity: The facility is designed to convert 40 tonnes per day of non-recyclable waste. Technology: Uses PHE\u2019s proprietary DMG\u00ae technology to produce hydrogen and power. Status: As of late January/early February 2026, Powerhouse Energy has submitted a full planning application and is moving ahead with permitting. Lease Agreement: A 25-year lease for the site was signed, including a 12-month rent-free period. Strategic Importance: The site was chosen for its available infrastructure, local feedstock, and support from local councils, aimed at aiding Northern Ireland's decarbonisation targets. This project is part of a \"design-build-operate\" model, with Powerhouse seeking project-specific finance. The facility is intended to be a low-emission, low-impact, and self-sufficient solution.",

If Engsolve carries out the FEED work in house, it\u2019s cheaper than farming it out and gives much clearer cost and risk definition re its experience with DMG. That reduces uncertainty for external funders and makes funding easier to price, which is why I see a better than even chance (around 60\u201370%) of funding being secured. The remaining question isn\u2019t whether funding happens its all down to how its structured and that\u2019s the adviser\u2019s job (Longspur). We know the technology works at 2.5tpd . A x16 scale up is all about confidence and determination. we can't afford to wait for AUS and the pipeline will only come onboard after 40tpd results.",

I assume autism was referenced \u2014 classy, as ever. If this project goes ahead, it\u2019s entirely reliant on third parties: investors and, crucially, an off-take agreement. This won't work unless there's a pre-established market for 3.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day. To raise funding, they will need far more than a letter of intent \u2014 they\u2019ll need a binding contract. Timescales are another major issue. With Wrightbus and others increasing hydrogen demand, can they realistically wait years PHE to build a facility, or will they be forced to source hydrogen elsewhere? And if that happens, where does it leave PHE? That\u2019s before you even get to planning. No idea how long that will take \u2014 and let\u2019s hope the neighbours don\u2019t object to the noise and traffic. Didn\u2019t that become a problem in Bridgend with the 2.5-tonne unit?

While the project is a commercial development rather than a direct recipient of public grant funding, it is positioned to benefit from UK hydrogen subsidies and strategic partnerships within the region. Funding Strategy: Unlike their usual \"capital-light\" licensing model, PHE plans to secure project finance for the Ballymena plant due to favourable local conditions, including potential support from the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Partnerships & Subsidies: The project is aligned with the regional hydrogen hub ambitions, working with stakeholders such as Wrightbus and Translink. The project is also linked to a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) development underwritten by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). Government Support: The project falls within the scope of UK government initiatives, such as the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) and Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), which support green hydrogen production.",

Namely, because it classed green hydrogen as including pyrolysis and gasification which, in the industry, it clearly is not. From memory, I think they stated a 40tpd DMG unit would bring in around \u00a312m per year in revenue. Happy to be corrected on that though. What is happening now is typical AIM cogs within AIM cogs, and all of them awaiting hoped for funding from third parties to move forward, if not to stay afloat. It's worth remembering that it takes on average 3 to 9 months to secure funding through companies such as Longspur Capital once started. So they shall be busy trying to secure revenue for Powerhouse from their \u00a3980 per month rented seats down in London ( yes, my research does go that far). All of those being tapped for money shall be doing their due diligence and asking the questions that I have been asking all along and which were covered by Dustyslay's overview regarding gasification and pyrolysis in general in his post on the weekend just gone.

We have partners... come back from dululu land Highest potential current partners: National Hydrogen - framework + FEED (engineering design) contract: design work only, not construction B.S.

National Hydrogen (Australia): Yes, some money, Approx, a few million (enough for studies & early work, not enough to build plants) B.S. Holdings (NI): Unknown / likely no significant money, (no public evidence of funds) No EPC / construction partner signed No major utility, oil major, or infrastructure fund No partner with finances committed Here comes the worst part gentlemen: We dont even have full detailed plant design yet which could take months or years...

Oh no I can't, they have all been deleted from your previous life as DrAnomoly, along with all the posts of your second reincarnation H2hooo. But, unlike you, I have a memory.

Are you actually aware of the state Spain is in, or are you just assuming that what Judith Charmers has told you still stands.   My new business deals with climate change and emergencies, so here's a very condensed synopsis from a report I have: Longer, hotter heatwaves.  Summer 2025 was hottest on record - temperatures regularly exceeding 45 \u00b0C. Numerous regions are suffering droughts for long periods, but when rain does come, it\u2019s very heavy concentrated bursts. This leads to intense flash flooding, rivers bursting their banks and causing widespread evacuations, commercial closures, road and key infrastructure damage, tourist towns and resorts shut for 6 to 12 months+, erosion of land, damage to homes and destruction of crops, farms and growing infrastructure. Rising sea levels and storm surges are another concern, affecting low-lying coastal communities and infrastructure. Ongoing droughts are leading to increased fire risks, with wildfires burning for months driven by hot, dry conditions and strong winds, destroying ecosystems, biodiversity needed for agri, displacing people and costing lives. Climate extremes are not just environmental; they\u2019re economic and societal problems.  Displacement of people is becoming more commonplace due to the increased flooding of dried river beds and destruction of economic viability of small traditional communities. While projected losses are rising into the tens of billions of euros each year and only set to significantly increase, the weather conditions are less predictable than ever.  The situation is compounded by the lack of any insurance cover, both commercially and domestically and the rising cost of what is available is making it unaffordable for many to continue to protect their homes and communities. Heat, drought and floods are all disrupting Spain\u2019s key economic backbone of farming, with harvest yields and productivity majorly affected in recent year. It\u2019s also a well-known fact, that Spain is running out of water for agriculture and this will worsen due to continue heatwaves and droughts. Ultimately, I guess the above is already putting a huge strain on Spanish economy and importantly their health care provision.",

I\u2019ll just add in some info from AI so I don\u2019t get it wrong and all LSE police come out in force\u2026 Powerhouse Energy Group (PHE) is advancing a waste-to-hydrogen facility at the former Michelin tyre production site in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. The project aims to convert non-recyclable waste into hydrogen, electricity, and heat using their patented Distributed Modular Generation (DMG\u00ae) technology. Key Project Details: Location: Silverwood Business Park, Ballymena (former Michelin site). Site Area: Approximately 1.98 acres. Capacity: The facility is designed to convert 40 tonnes per day of non-recyclable waste. Technology: Uses PHE\u2019s proprietary DMG\u00ae technology to produce hydrogen and power. Status: As of late January/early February 2026, Powerhouse Energy has submitted a full planning application and is moving ahead with permitting. Lease Agreement: A 25-year lease for the site was signed, including a 12-month rent-free period. Strategic Importance: The site was chosen for its available infrastructure, local feedstock, and support from local councils, aimed at aiding Northern Ireland's decarbonisation targets. This project is part of a \"design-build-operate\" model, with Powerhouse seeking project-specific finance. The facility is intended to be a low-emission, low-impact, and self-sufficient solution.",

If Engsolve carries out the FEED work in house, it\u2019s cheaper than farming it out and gives much clearer cost and risk definition re its experience with DMG. That reduces uncertainty for external funders and makes funding easier to price, which is why I see a better than even chance (around 60\u201370%) of funding being secured. The remaining question isn\u2019t whether funding happens its all down to how its structured and that\u2019s the adviser\u2019s job (Longspur). We know the technology works at 2.5tpd . A x16 scale up is all about confidence and determination. we can't afford to wait for AUS and the pipeline will only come onboard after 40tpd results.",

I assume autism was referenced \u2014 classy, as ever. If this project goes ahead, it\u2019s entirely reliant on third parties: investors and, crucially, an off-take agreement. This won't work unless there's a pre-established market for 3.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day. To raise funding, they will need far more than a letter of intent \u2014 they\u2019ll need a binding contract. Timescales are another major issue. With Wrightbus and others increasing hydrogen demand, can they realistically wait years PHE to build a facility, or will they be forced to source hydrogen elsewhere? And if that happens, where does it leave PHE? That\u2019s before you even get to planning. No idea how long that will take \u2014 and let\u2019s hope the neighbours don\u2019t object to the noise and traffic. Didn\u2019t that become a problem in Bridgend with the 2.5-tonne unit?

Funding Strategy: Unlike their usual \"capital-light\" licensing model, PHE plans to secure project finance for the Ballymena plant due to favourable local conditions, including potential support from the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Partnerships & Subsidies: The project is aligned with the regional hydrogen hub ambitions, working with stakeholders such as Wrightbus and Translink. The project is also linked to a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) development underwritten by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). Government Support: The project falls within the scope of UK government initiatives, such as the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) and Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), which support green hydrogen production.",

Namely, because it classed green hydrogen as including pyrolysis and gasification which, in the industry, it clearly is not. From memory, I think they stated a 40tpd DMG unit would bring in around \u00a312m per year in revenue. Happy to be corrected on that though. What is happening now is typical AIM cogs within AIM cogs, and all of them awaiting hoped for funding from third parties to move forward, if not to stay afloat. It's worth remembering that it takes on average 3 to 9 months to secure funding through companies such as Longspur Capital once started. So they shall be busy trying to secure revenue for Powerhouse from their \u00a3980 per month rented seats down in London ( yes, my research does go that far). All of those being tapped for money shall be doing their due diligence and asking the questions that I have been asking all along and which were covered by Dustyslay's overview regarding gasification and pyrolysis in general in his post on the weekend just gone. All the best.",

Are you actually aware of the state Spain is in, or are you just assuming that what Judith Charmers has told you still stands.   My new business deals with climate change and emergencies, so here's a very condensed synopsis from a report I have: Longer, hotter heatwaves.  Summer 2025 was hottest on record - temperatures regularly exceeding 45 \u00b0C. Numerous regions are suffering droughts for long periods, but when rain does come, it\u2019s very heavy concentrated bursts. This leads to intense flash flooding, rivers bursting their banks and causing widespread evacuations, commercial closures, road and key infrastructure damage, tourist towns and resorts shut for 6 to 12 months+, erosion of land, damage to homes and destruction of crops, farms and growing infrastructure. Rising sea levels and storm surges are another concern, affecting low-lying coastal communities and infrastructure. Ongoing droughts are leading to increased fire risks, with wildfires burning for months driven by hot, dry conditions and strong winds, destroying ecosystems, biodiversity needed for agri, displacing people and costing lives. Climate extremes are not just environmental; they\u2019re economic and societal problems.  Displacement of people is becoming more commonplace due to the increased flooding of dried river beds and destruction of economic viability of small traditional communities. While projected losses are rising into the tens of billions of euros each year and only set to significantly increase, the weather conditions are less predictable than ever.  The situation is compounded by the lack of any insurance cover, both commercially and domestically and the rising cost of what is available is making it unaffordable for many to continue to protect their homes and communities. Heat, drought and floods are all disrupting Spain\u2019s key economic backbone of farming, with harvest yields and productivity majorly affected in recent year. It\u2019s also a well-known fact, that Spain is running out of water for agriculture and this will worsen due to continue heatwaves and droughts. Ultimately, I guess the above is already putting a huge strain on Spanish economy and importantly their health care provision.",

          "content": "Castle, you do realise climate change affects the whole world and not just certain countries \u2013 FFS!! It\u2019s not like you can outrun it!  Are you actually aware of the state Spain is in, or are you just assuming that what Judith Charmers has told you still stands.   My new business deals with climate change and emergencies, so here's a very condensed synopsis from a report I have: Longer, hotter heatwaves.  Summer 2025 was hottest on record - temperatures regularly exceeding 45 \u00b0C. Numerous regions are suffering droughts for long periods, but when rain does come, it\u2019s very heavy concentrated bursts. This leads to intense flash flooding, rivers bursting their banks and causing widespread evacuations, commercial closures, road and key infrastructure damage, tourist towns and resorts shut for 6 to 12 months+, erosion of land, damage to homes and destruction of crops, farms and growing infrastructure. Rising sea levels and storm surges are another concern, affecting low-lying coastal communities and infrastructure. Ongoing droughts are leading to increased fire risks, with wildfires burning for months driven by hot, dry conditions and strong winds, destroying ecosystems, biodiversity needed for agri, displacing people and costing lives. Climate extremes are not just environmental; they\u2019re economic and societal problems.  Displacement of people is becoming more commonplace due to the increased flooding of dried river beds and destruction of economic viability of small traditional communities. While projected losses are rising into the tens of billions of euros each year and only set to significantly increase, the weather conditions are less predictable than ever.  The situation is compounded by the lack of any insurance cover, both commercially and domestically and the rising cost of what is available is making it unaffordable for many to continue to protect their homes and communities. Heat, drought and floods are all disrupting Spain\u2019s key economic backbone of farming, with harvest yields and productivity majorly affected in recent year. It\u2019s also a well-known fact, that Spain is running out of water for agriculture and this will worsen due to continue heatwaves and droughts. Ultimately, I guess the above is already putting a huge strain on Spanish economy and importantly their health care provision.",

I\u2019ll just add in some info from AI so I don\u2019t get it wrong and all LSE police come out in force\u2026 Powerhouse Energy Group (PHE) is advancing a waste-to-hydrogen facility at the former Michelin tyre production site in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. The project aims to convert non-recyclable waste into hydrogen, electricity, and heat using their patented Distributed Modular Generation (DMG\u00ae) technology. Key Project Details: Location: Silverwood Business Park, Ballymena (former Michelin site). Site Area: Approximately 1.98 acres. Capacity: The facility is designed to convert 40 tonnes per day of non-recyclable waste. Technology: Uses PHE\u2019s proprietary DMG\u00ae technology to produce hydrogen and power. Status: As of late January/early February 2026, Powerhouse Energy has submitted a full planning application and is moving ahead with permitting. Lease Agreement: A 25-year lease for the site was signed, including a 12-month rent-free period. Strategic Importance: The site was chosen for its available infrastructure, local feedstock, and support from local councils, aimed at aiding Northern Ireland's decarbonisation targets. This project is part of a \"design-build-operate\" model, with Powerhouse seeking project-specific finance. The facility is intended to be a low-emission, low-impact, and self-sufficient solution.",

If Engsolve carries out the FEED work in house, it\u2019s cheaper than farming it out and gives much clearer cost and risk definition re its experience with DMG. That reduces uncertainty for external funders and makes funding easier to price, which is why I see a better than even chance (around 60\u201370%) of funding being secured. The remaining question isn\u2019t whether funding happens its all down to how its structured and that\u2019s the adviser\u2019s job (Longspur). We know the technology works at 2.5tpd . A x16 scale up is all about confidence and determination. we can't afford to wait for AUS and the pipeline will only come onboard after 40tpd results.",

I get that probably doesnt appear that way, but i dont whinge and whine or complain I just get on with it and focus on what needs to be achieved than being negative posting all the problems and sort of deramping every possibility. I likely come across as negative and argumentative as I don't particularly enjoy the experience others bring to forums. Castle, for all his faults, false dawns and ramping seems a really positive, outward thinking bloke so I get along, likes of Red are people who want to see people fail, to see this crash and come here \"PMSL\" at investors. Thats not really something I respect really, when a forum doesnt have these types of people I tend to operate well. But when you have negative,  horrible nasty deadbeats it gets me down. Amount of money people could make on forums, if we all respected one another and compromised our ideals and opinions. Its quite sad",

I assume autism was referenced \u2014 classy, as ever. If this project goes ahead, it\u2019s entirely reliant on third parties: investors and, crucially, an off-take agreement. This won't work unless there's a pre-established market for 3.5 tonnes of hydrogen per day. To raise funding, they will need far more than a letter of intent \u2014 they\u2019ll need a binding contract. Timescales are another major issue. With Wrightbus and others increasing hydrogen demand, can they realistically wait years PHE to build a facility, or will they be forced to source hydrogen elsewhere? And if that happens, where does it leave PHE? That\u2019s before you even get to planning. No idea how long that will take \u2014 and let\u2019s hope the neighbours don\u2019t object to the noise and traffic. Didn\u2019t that become a problem in Bridgend with the 2.5-tonne unit?

          "content": "Powerhouse Energy Group (PHE) is developing a waste-to-hydrogen facility at the Silverwood Business Park in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, designed to convert 40 tonnes of waste daily into high-purity hydrogen. While the project is a commercial development rather than a direct recipient of public grant funding, it is positioned to benefit from UK hydrogen subsidies and strategic partnerships within the region. Funding Strategy: Unlike their usual \"capital-light\" licensing model, PHE plans to secure project finance for the Ballymena plant due to favourable local conditions, including potential support from the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Partnerships & Subsidies: The project is aligned with the regional hydrogen hub ambitions, working with stakeholders such as Wrightbus and Translink. The project is also linked to a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) development underwritten by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). Government Support: The project falls within the scope of UK government initiatives, such as the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) and Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), which support green hydrogen production.",

Namely, because it classed green hydrogen as including pyrolysis and gasification which, in the industry, it clearly is not. From memory, I think they stated a 40tpd DMG unit would bring in around \u00a312m per year in revenue. Happy to be corrected on that though. What is happening now is typical AIM cogs within AIM cogs, and all of them awaiting hoped for funding from third parties to move forward, if not to stay afloat. It's worth remembering that it takes on average 3 to 9 months to secure funding through companies such as Longspur Capital once started. So they shall be busy trying to secure revenue for Powerhouse from their \u00a3980 per month rented seats down in London ( yes, my research does go that far). All of those being tapped for money shall be doing their due diligence and asking the questions that I have been asking all along and which were covered by Dustyslay's overview regarding gasification and pyrolysis in general in his post on the weekend just gone. All the best.",
