UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nGem Resources Plc\n(the \"\nCompany\"\nand together with its subsidiaries from time to time, the \"Group\" or \"\nGEMR\n\")\nAdoption of Cryptocurrency and Digital Asset Treasury Policy\nGem Resources Plc (LSE: GEMR)\n, the emerald mining and development company with operations in South Africa and Australia, is pleased to announce that its board of directors (the \"\nBoard\n\") has formally approved and adopted a\nCryptocurrency and Digital Asset Treasury Policy (the \"Policy\")\n, supported by an updated Financial Position and Prospects Procedures Board Memorandum (\"\nFPPP\n\") and a new Company Standard Operating Procedure (\"\nSOP\n\").\nThe Policy establishes a clear framework for the acquisition, holding, and management of cryptocurrencies within GEMR's treasury and commercial operations. It reflects the Company's commitment to disciplined governance, regulatory compliance, and transparent reporting, while positioning GEMR to benefit from the growing adoption of digital assets in global commerce. For the avoidance of doubt, the Policy does not change the Company's strategic focus on emerald mining and development and does not involve any admission of cryptoassets to trading venues or public offers of cryptoassets by the Company.\nKey Features of the Policy\n\u00b7\nStrategic rationale\n- Cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin, will be used both as a store of value and inflation hedge, and as a practical commercial utility. GEMR will now be able to\naccept payment for emerald sales in Bitcoin and other Board-approved cryptocurrencies\n, facilitating trade and offtake with a broader range of international partners. Any acceptance of cryptoassets as consideration will be converted into fiat or retained in accordance with Board\n\u2011\napproved risk limits and capital preservation thresholds, and will comply with applicable Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (\"\nAML\n\"; \"\nCTF\n\") and sanctions requirements.\n\u00b7\nRisk management\n- The Company acknowledges that cryptocurrency investments are subject to significant volatility and regulatory uncertainty. The Policy includes comprehensive risk management procedures, including position limits, regular mark-to-market valuations, and stress testing scenarios.\n\u00b7\nAllocation approach\n- Initial approved assets include Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. Unless otherwise resolved by the Board, at least 50% of GEMR's cryptocurrency holdings will be maintained in Bitcoin, with the balance allocated at the Board's discretion to other approved cryptocurrencies in line with market conditions and in accordance with the Policy. The Company will always retain sufficient working capital in fiat currencies (principally GBP and USD) to cover operational, payroll, and listing obligations, ensuring that cryptocurrency holdings are in addition to, rather than a substitute for, essential liquidity.\n\u00b7\nHong Kong hub for crypto operations\n- Gem Resources Limited (\"\nGEMR HK\n\"), a wholly-owned Kong Kong incorporated subsidiary of the Company, will serve as the designated operational hub for the Group's cryptocurrency activities, including maintaining a Hong Kong bank account, managing operational cryptocurrency wallets, receiving emerald sales proceeds in Bitcoin or other approved cryptocurrencies, executing cryptocurrency transactions, and ensuring compliance with applicable Hong Kong financial services regulations in relation to cryptocurrencies and the Policy.\n\u00b7\nCustody & security\n- the Company will implement a \"cold-storage-first\" custody utilising multi-signature authorisation, whitelisted wallets (pre-approved wallet addresses) and regulated custodial partners. Operational wallets will be used for day-to-day receipts and working balances, with periodic movements of excess holdings to long-term cold storage (offline storage systems). Safeguarding arrangements will align to UK regulatory expectations for cryptoasset custody, including segregation, reconciliation and resilient access controls.\n\u00b7\nGovernance & approvals\n- All cryptocurrency transfers and transactions require dual authorisation from designated personnel, with quarterly Board review and audit committee oversight of all cryptocurrency activities. Monthly reconciliation and consolidated reporting will be provided to the Board and a designated senior manager of the Company, appropriately qualified in digital asset management, will be responsible for Policy oversight and internal control effectiveness. Material deviations from the Policy require prior Board approval.\n\u00b7\nCompliance & reporting\n- The Policy aligns with UK MAR, Financial Conduct Authority (\"\nFCA\n\") requirements, and international AML, CTF and Know Your Customer (\"\nKYC\n\") requirements. Cryptocurrency holdings will be classified and accounted for as intangible assets under International Accounting Standard 38 \"Intangible Assets\" at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. . Detailed disclosures regarding cryptocurrency holdings, accounting policies, risk exposures, and fair value information will be provided in the Company's financial statements in due course, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") 7 \"Financial Instruments: Disclosures\" and IFRS 13 \"Fair Value Measurement\".\n\u00b7\nImplementation\n- the Company has implemented comprehensive operational procedures to support the Policy:\no\na\nCrypto Treasury SOP\nhas been adopted covering wallet management, commercial receipts, execution, reconciliation, controls, and incident response;\no\nthe FPPP has been updated to integrate GEMR HK operations, dual-authorisation requirements and cryptocurrency reporting protocols; and\no\nthe Company has updated its risk management framework - the SOP includes incident escalation procedures, cyber response and business continuity plans to address operational risks.\nAdditional information\n\u00b7\nNo change of business\n- The adoption of the Policy is a treasury and operational measure and does not change the nature of the Group's principal activities. The Board has assessed that the Policy does not constitute a fundamental change of business or a reverse takeover under UK Listing Rule (\"\nUKLR\n\") 22.3, as cryptocurrency activities remain ancillary to core operations and below relevant size thresholds. If the Company were to contemplate any transaction involving cryptoassets that, when aggregated with other transactions, may amount to a reverse takeover, the Company would make the requisite announcements and, where required, seek shareholder approval in accordance with the UKLRs.\nLouis Ching, Executive Chairman of Gem Resources Plc, commented:\n\"My vision is to lead GEMR into new frontiers of value creation, and this Cryptocurrency Treasury Policy is a central pillar of that strategy. Through this framework, we gain optionality in how we deploy capital, broaden our settlement universe, and strengthen resilience in volatile macro environments. Importantly, sufficient working capital will always remain in fiat to meet operational, payroll, and listing obligations, ensuring that our day-to-day activities are fully supported. The ability to receive emerald sales proceeds in Bitcoin or other approved digital assets not only aligns GEMR with evolving market preferences, but also enhances our global reach and capital efficiency. By combining robust governance and conservative capital management with this forward-looking approach, GEMR is ensuring that digital assets contribute responsibly to both operational efficiency and long-term shareholder value.\"\nEnquiries:\nGem Resources Plc\nExecutive Chairman\nLouis Ching\nChief Executive Officer\nBernard Olivier\n+44 (0)746 368 6497\ninfo@gemresources.co.uk\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nJoint Corporate Broker\nLucy Williams\nDuncan Vasey\nCapital Plus Partners\nJoint Corporate Broker\nJon Critchley\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\n+44 (0)203 821 6169\nAbout Gem Resources Plc (\"GEMR\")\nGEMR is an emerging emerald producer, focusing on the Gravelotte Emerald Mine.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n26 September 2025\nGem Resources plc\n(\"\nGEMR\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nThe Directors of GEMR are pleased to present the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Gem Resources plc for the six months ended 30 June 2025.\nGem Resources plc (LSE: GEMR), the mineral exploration group listed on the Standard List segment of the main market of the London Stock Exchange announces its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025. The full report is available on the Company's website at www.gemresources.co.uk. In accordance with Listing Rule 9.6.1 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), a copy of the 2025 Interim Report will also be submitted to the FCA via the National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available to the public for inspection at:\nhttps://www.fca.org.uk/markets/primary-markets/regulatory-disclosures/national-storage-mechanism\nChairman's Statement\nGEM Resources Plc - Interim Results for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nI am honoured to address you for the first time as Executive Chairman of Gem Resources Plc (\"GEMR\"\nor the \"Company\"\n). The first half of 2025 has been a period of transformation, marked by important operational milestones and the foundations for decisive strategic initiatives that are being advanced post period-end.\nStrategic Priorities: Post-Period Treasury and Offtake Initiatives\nFollowing the end of the reporting period, the Board has advanced two pivotal initiatives that will define GEMR's future trajectory.\nTreasury Policy Update\nThe Board has proposed a\nstrategic and transformative update to GEMR's Treasury Policy, under which, surplus funds, once fully approved and implemented, may be allocated into leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The objective is to diversify liquid assets, strengthen financial flexibility, and align GEMR with capital management practices increasingly adopted by innovative global resource companies.\nIn support of this proposed policy, GEMR is internally developing a proprietary algorithmic entry strategy designed to optimise potential returns within the parameters of the Treasury Policy. This forward-looking approach will serve both as a hedge and as a way of integrating the Company into the digital finance ecosystem, an area of growing importance to global investment and commodity trade.\nOfftake and Pre-Financing Agreement\nPost period-end, the Company also began progressing negotiations to secure a significant offtake and pre-finance trade agreement for its Gravelotte emerald production. We are in advanced discussions with leading tokenisation and commodity trading partners to establish a direct-offtake structure. The intent is to provide upfront liquidity for mine development while opening access to broader global sales channels-including decentralised platforms-thereby accelerating growth and maximising the value of GEMR's assets.\nOperational Progress\nDuring the first half of the year, GEMR commenced hard-rock mining at the Cobra Open Pit in South Africa, confirming Gravelotte's geological model and production potential. Early test sales, although modest, validated our processing methods and provided proof of concept for commercialisation, despite the challenging backdrop in the gemstone sector.\nBoard Transformation and Capitalisation\nPost period-end, GEMR completed a \u00a32.117 million recapitalisation comprising a \u00a3617,320 equity subscription at market price, the issuance of \u00a31.5 million unsecured convertible loan notes at a 50% premium to the subscription price, and the planned conversion of approximately \u00a3230,000 of accrued Board fees into equity also at a 50% premium to the subscription price. These measures have significantly strengthened the Company's balance sheet and stabilised working capital.\nWe also welcomed Mr Hin Shek (\"Hans\") Wong as a Non-Executive Director, further broadening the Board's expertise. The accelerated Rule 9 waiver, approved by the Takeover Panel, with the backing of independent shareholders, reflects strong support for the Company's strategy and governance.\nShareholder Alignment and ESG Commitment\nAs the Company's majority shareholder, my overriding objective is to ensure value creation for all stakeholders. We remain committed to maintaining strong ESG standards, ensuring transparent engagement with our communities, and fostering clear communication with the market.\nOutlook\nWhile the gemstone market remains subdued, GEMR now has the operational progress, strengthened financial position, and new strategic initiatives required to advance Gravelotte and Curlew, while also establishing innovative financing and marketing channels. These developments provide a solid foundation for long-term growth.\nOn behalf of the Board, I thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. I look forward to reporting further progress as we implement our post-period initiatives-the proposed crypto treasury policy and the offtake agreement-which we believe will be central to GEMR's next chapter.\nLouis Ching\nExecutive Chairman\n25 September 2025\nBusiness Review\nThe Directors present the interim results of Gem Resources Plc\n(\"GEMR\" or the \"Company\")\n, together with its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), for the six-month period from 1 January 2025 to 30 June 2025.\nFinancial and Operational Review\nThe first half of 2025 was a period of transition and challenge for the Company. Operationally, we achieved encouraging progress at the Gravelotte Emerald Mine with the commencement of hard-rock mining and our first trial sales. At the same time, we were faced with a constrained financial position, as highlighted in both the Annual Report published in April 2025 and again in these Interim Results. Against this backdrop, the post-period refinancing and Board changes represent a turning point for the Company.\nGravelotte Operations\nIn January 2025, GEMR commenced hard-rock mining at the Cobra Open Pit, part of the Gravelotte Emerald Mine in South Africa. Results from the initial mining and processing runs have been encouraging, with emerald-bearing material recovered and processed through the upgraded plant. These activities confirm that Gravelotte has the potential to develop into an economically viable emerald mine, though further work, investment and market support will be required before such a conclusion can be reached.\nFirst Sales\nDuring February and March 2025, the Company completed its first trial sales of emeralds and by-products, generating gross proceeds of approximately USD57,000 (c. \u00a345,000). While modest in scale and completed against subdued gemstone market conditions, these sales represent an important proof-of-concept for our recovery and marketing processes.\nBoard and Corporate Developments\nDuring the period, Directors demonstrated their alignment with shareholders by agreeing to receive a portion of their accrued fees in equity rather than cash. A total of 5,999,998 new ordinary shares were issued at 0.65 pence per share, representing a 31% premium to the prevailing market price at the time. This decision both preserved cash resources and reflected the Directors' confidence in the Company's long-term potential.\nIn June 2025, we also bid farewell to Sam Mulligan, who resigned from the Board, and we thank him for his service and contribution.\nRestructuring and Refinancing\nSubsequent to the period-end, GEMR completed a transformational \u00a32.117 million recapitalisation. This comprised a \u00a3617,320 equity subscription at the then market price of 0.20 pence per share and the issue of \u00a31.5 million unsecured convertible loan notes, convertible at a 50% premium to that subscription price. As part of this restructuring and refinancing, the Board also agreed that all outstanding and accrued fees - approximately \u00a3230,000 - would be converted into equity at the same 50% premium to the subscription price.\nThis refinancing not only provided critical working capital, but also addressed the Company's previously poor financial condition, which had been a matter of concern in earlier reporting. In conjunction with the refinancing, Mr Louis Ching was appointed as Executive Chairman and Mr Hin Shek (\"Hans\") Wong joined as a Non-Executive Director. On behalf of management, I am pleased to formally welcome them to GEMR. Their expertise and commitment will be invaluable as we take the Company forward. Importantly, the Takeover Panel granted an accelerated Rule 9 waiver following the written approval of a majority of independent shareholders, ensuring that the transaction could proceed in the best interests of all shareholders.\nFinancial Performance\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025, GEMR reported:\n\u00b7\nOther operating income: \u00a345,000 (H1 2024: nil) from initial trial sales\n\u00b7\nOperating expenses: \u00a3410,000 (H1 2024: \u00a3535,000)\n\u00b7\nLoss after tax: \u00a3386,000 (H1 2024: \u00a3561,000)\n\u00b7\nNet assets: \u00a31.25m at 30 June 2025 (31 Dec 2024: \u00a31.69m)\n\u00b7\nCash: \u00a374,000 at 30 June 2025 (31 Dec 2024: \u00a3414,000)\nThe successful fundraising and the proposed conversion of accrued Board and management fees into equity have materially strengthened the balance sheet and positioned the Company to progress its operations.\nOutlook\nWhile challenges remain, GEMR is now in a stronger position than at the start of the year. The early results at Gravelotte, together with our improved financial footing and strengthened leadership team, provide a solid foundation on which to build.\nFollowing the post-period subscription and convertible loan note issuance, the Company now has the resources and structure to pursue its strategic objectives. The proceeds will be applied to advancing in-pit exploration at the Gravelotte Emerald Mine in South Africa to improve resource definition, together with open pit optimisation and upgrades to processing and sorting systems aimed at increasing production and lowering unit mining costs. At the Curlew Emerald Mine in Australia, work will focus on exploration, development, and the progression towards a restart of operations. In addition, funds will support exploration and assessment activities Zambian licence areas, the strengthening of corporate governance and operational systems to align with the Company's enlarged capital base, and the positioning of GEMR to pursue innovative financing and marketing channels, including the proposed crypto treasury policy and potential offtake structures.\nWith these measures in place, GEMR is better equipped to deliver operational progress, unlock value from its asset base, and move closer to establishing itself as a sustainable and reliable participant in the global emerald market.\nBernard Olivier\nChief Executive Officer\n25 September 2025\nDirectors'\nReport\nThe directors present their interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the six-month period from 1\u00a0January 2025 to 30 June 2025.\nDIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY\nThe directors who have served during the period and up to the date of approval were as follows:\nLouis Ching1\nExecutive Chairman\nHin Shek \"Hans\" Wong1\nNon-Executive Director\nEdward Nealon\nNon-Executive Director\nBernard Olivier\nChief Executive Officer\nPeter Redmond\nExecutive Director\nJohn Treacy\nNon-Executive Director\nSam Mulligan2\nOperations Director\n1. Appointed 4 September 2025.\n2. Resigned on 19 June 2025.\nGOING CONCERN\nThe Company raises money for exploration and capital projects as and when required. There can be no assurance that the Group's projects will be fully developed in accordance with current plans or completed on time or to budget. Future work on the development of these projects, the levels of production and financial returns arising therefrom, may be adversely affected by factors outside the control of the\nGroup and Company\n.\nThe ability of the\nGroup\nto meet its projected expenditure is dependent on further equity injections and/or the raising of cash through debt instruments. These conditions necessarily indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt over the\nGroup's\nability to continue as a going concern and therefore its ability to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Whilst acknowledging this material uncertainty, the Directors remain confident of raising finance and therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare these interim condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the\nGroup\nwere unable to continue as a going concern.\nRESULTS AND DIVIDENDS\nThe interim condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income is set out on page 8 and shows the loss for six-month period to 30 June 2025. The directors consider the loss for the period to be in line with expectations. The directors do not recommend a payment of a dividend.\nWe confirm to the best of our knowledge:\na) the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\"; and\nb) the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by Disclosure and Transparency Rules 4.2.7R and 4.2.8R of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.\nSigned on behalf of the Board who approved the half yearly financial report on 25 September 2025.\nLouis Ching\nExecutive Chairman\n25 September 2025\nInterim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n6 months to 30 June 2025\nUnaudited\n6 months to 30 June 2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nOther operating income\n45\n-\nOperating expenses\n(410)\n(535)\nOperating loss\n(365)\n(535)\nInterest expense\n(29)\n(26)\nInterest income\n3\n-\nLoss before taxation\n(391)\n(561)\nTaxation\n5\n-\nLoss for the period\n(386)\n(561)\nOther comprehensive income\nLoss for the period\n(386)\n(561)\nItems that may be reclassified to profit or loss:\nExchange difference on currency translations\n(16)\n(12)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(402)\n(573)\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (pence)\n10\n(0.11)\n(0.21)\nThe\naccompanying notes\nform part of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements.\nInterim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\nCompany number: 05329401\n30 June\n2025\nUnaudited\n31 December 2024\nAudited\nNote\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nASSETS\nNon-current assets\nExploration asset\n28\n26\nGoodwill\n728\n728\nProperty, plant and equipment\n342\n373\nRight of use asset\n22\n29\nTotal non-current Assets\n1,120\n1,156\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n22\n9\nOther receivables\n6\n18\n101\nRestricted cash\n12\n12\nCash and cash equivalents\n74\n414\nTotal current assets\n126\n536\nTotal assets\n1,246\n1,692\nLIABILITIES\nNon-current liabilities\nLease liabilities\n(13)\n(19)\nOther payables\n(503)\n(479)\nProvisions\n(12)\n(12)\nDeferred tax liability\n(3)\n(8)\nTotal non-current liabilities\n(531)\n(518)\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n7\n(393)\n(489)\nLease liabilities\n(10)\n(10)\nTotal current liabilities\n(403)\n(499)\nTotal liabilities\n(934)\n(1,017)\nNet assets\n312\n675\nEQUITY\nShare capital\n8\n31\n30\nShare premium\n8\n4,728\n4,690\nOther reserves\n52\n344\nAccumulated loss\n(4,313)\n(4,184)\nTotal equity attributable to equity owners of the parent\n498\n880\nNon-controlling interest\n(186)\n(205)\nTotal equity\n312\n675\nThe accompanying notes form part of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board and were signed on its behalf by:\nLouis Ching\nExecutive Chairman\n25 September 2025\nInterim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\nShare\ncapital\nShare\npremium\nOther\nreserves\nAccumu-lated loss\nNon-Controlling interest\nTotal equity\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nAs at 1 January 2025\n30\n4,690\n344\n(4,184)\n(205)\n675\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n-\n(331)\n(55)\n(386)\nOther comprehensive income\n-\n-\n(90)\n-\n74\n(16)\nTotal comprehensive income\n(90)\n(331)\n19\n(402)\nEquity issued\n1\n38\n-\n-\n-\n39\nWarrants lapsed\n-\n-\n(202)\n202\n-\n-\nAs at 30 June 2025\n31\n4,728\n52\n(4,313)\n(186)\n312\nShare\ncapital\nShare\npremium\nOther\nreserves\nAccumu-lated loss\nTotal equity\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nAs at 1 January 2024 (restated -

It is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The address of its registered office is at 9th Floor, 107 Cheapside, London, United Kingdom, EC2V 6DN and its shares are listed on the Equity Shares (Transition) segment of the Market of the London Stock Exchange.\n2.\nNature of operations\nGEMR is a mineral exploration and an emerging emerald producer. The Group leverages the extensive in-house skills of its Board and team to identify and pursue unique, value-enhancing opportunities in minerals with a view to proving-up early-stage exploration projects for ongoing monetisation and the delivery of stakeholder returns.\nThe Group's operations relate to the exploration of the GEM asset in South Africa, the Malaika licence areas in Zambia and the Curlew Emerald Mine in Australia as well as the maintenance of the appropriate licenses over these areas with phased production which commenced at GEM in April 2024.\n3. Basis\nof\npreparation\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements are for the six-month period ended 30\u00a0June 2025. They have been prepared in accordance with IAS34 'Interim Financial Reporting'. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information required in annual financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe financial information set out in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified but included a material uncertainty related to going concern.\nIn the opinion of the Directors the interim condensed consolidated financial statements present fairly the Company's financial position, and results from operations and cash flows for the\nperiod\nin conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.\nCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThere have been no changes to the critical accounting judgements made nor the key sources of estimation to those disclosed in the 31 December 2024 financial statements.\nGoing concern\nThe Group raises money for exploration and capital projects as and when required. There can be no assurance that the Group's projects will be fully developed in accordance with current plans or completed on time or to budget. Future work on the development of these projects, the levels of production and financial returns arising therefrom, may be adversely affected by factors outside the control of the\nGroup and Company\n.\nThe ability of the\nGroup\nto meet its projected expenditure is dependent on further equity injections and/or the raising of cash through debt instruments. These conditions necessarily indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt over the\nGroup's\nability to continue as a going concern and therefore its ability to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Whilst acknowledging this material uncertainty, the Directors remain confident of raising finance and therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare these interim condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the\nGroup\nwere unable to continue as a going concern.\n4.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe Group has applied the same accounting policies, presentation, methods of computation, significant judgements and the key sources of estimation of uncertainties in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements as in its audited financial statements for the year ended 31\u00a0December 2024\nwhich were published on 30 April 2025\n, except for the following amendments which apply for the first time in 2025. However, not all are expected to impact the Group as they are either not relevant to the Group's activities or require accounting which is consistent with the Group's current accounting policies.\nThe following new standards and amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2025:\n\u00b7\nLack of exchangeability\n(Amendments to IAS 21\nThe Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\n)\nLack of exchangeability\n(Amendments to IAS 21\nThe Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\n)\nOn 15 August 2023, the IASB issued\nLack of Exchangeability\nwhich amended IAS 21\nThe Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (the Amendments)\n.\nThese Amendments are applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025. The Amendments introduce requirements to assess when a currency is exchangeable into another currency and when it is not. The Amendments require an entity to estimate the spot exchange rate when it concludes that a currency is not exchangeable into another currency. The Amendments also introduce additional disclosure requirements when an entity estimates a spot exchange rate because a currency is not exchangeable into another currency.\nIAS 21, prior to the Amendments, did not include explicit requirements for the determination of the exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, which led to diversity in practice.\nWhen applying the Amendments, an entity is not permitted to restate comparative information.\nThese Amendments have had no material effect on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.\n5.\nSegment information\nOperating segments\nThe Board of Directors consider that the Group has one operating segment, being that of emerald mining and exploration. Accordingly, all revenues, operating results, assets and liabilities are allocated to this activity.\nGeographical segments\nThe Group operates in three principal geographical areas - South Africa, Zambia and Australia.\nThe Group's non-current assets by location of assets are detailed below.\nSouth Africa\nZambia\nAustralia\nGroup\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\n30 June 2025\nTotal non-current assets\n596\n272\n252\n1,120\n31 December 2024\nTotal non-current assets\n623\n270\n263\n1,156\n6.\nOther receivables\n30 June\n2025\nUnaudited\n31 December 2024\nAudited\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nPrepayments\n5\n30\nSundry debtors\n-\n15\nVAT recoverable\n13\n56\n18\n101\n7.\nTrade and other payables\n30 June\n2025\nUnaudited\n31 December 2024\nAudited\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nTrade payables\n217\n232\nOther payables\n2\n17\nAccruals\n174\n240\n393\n489\n8.\nShare capital\n30 June\n2025\nUnaudited\n31 December 2024\nAudited\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nAllotted, called up and fully paid share capital\n31\n30\nMovements in Equity\nNumber of shares in issue\nNumber of shares in issue\n30 June\n2025\n31 December 2024\nOpening balance Ordinary Shares in issue of \u00a30.0001 each\n302,658,090\n252,345,590\nIssue of Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.0001 each\n5,999,998\n50,312,500\nClosing balance of Ordinary Shares in issue of \u00a30.0001 each\n308,658,088\n302,658,090\nThe Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income.\nShare capital\n30 June\n2025\nUnaudited\n31 December 2024\nAudited\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nBalance at the beginning of the period\n30\n25\nShares issued during the period\n1\n5\nBalance at the end of the period\n31\n30\nShare premium\n30 June\n2025\nUnaudited\n31 December 2024\nAudited\n\u00a3'000s\n\u00a3'000s\nBalance at the beginning of the period\n4,690\n3,980\nShares issued during the period\n38\n710\nBalance at the end of the period\n4,728\n4,690\nOrdinary shares\nAll shares rank equally with regard to the Company's residual assets.

None of the share options have been exercised.\nAs announced on 28 February 2025, the Company agreed to issue 5,999,998 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each (\"Ordinary Shares\") at an issue price of 0.65 pence per Ordinary Share to the directors Bernard Olivier, Edward Nealon and Peter Redmond in lieu of cash settlement of part of their accrued fees.\nFor a period of six months in 2025 and in order to preserve cash, all director salaries were accrued. At 30\u00a0June 2025, an amount of \u00a3120,583 (31 December 2024: \u00a3103,250) is due to directors and included in trade and other payables.\n10.\nEarnings per share\nEarnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDuring the period the calculation was based on the loss for the six-month period of \u00a3331,000 (H1 2024: \u00a3571,000) divided by the weighted number of ordinary shares 307,606,034 (H1 2024: 268,178,923).\nThe diluted loss per share and the basic loss per share are recorded as the same amount as conversion of share options and warrants decreases the basic loss per share, thus being anti-dilutive.\n11.\nFair value\nThe Group considers that the carrying amount of the following financial assets and financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair value:\n\u2022 Other receivables\n\u2022 Restricted cash\n\u2022 Cash at cash equivalents\n\u2022 Other payables\n\u2022 Trade and other payables.\n12.\nPrior period adjustments\nAs disclosed in the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group and the Company has provided a restated Balance Sheet as at 31\u00a0December 2023 and 1\u00a0January 2023 in accordance with IAS 8.\n(i) Restatement of prior year balances\nThe Group holds 74% in Venus Emeralds Proprietary Limited and Adit Mining Consultants and Trading Proprietary Limited via Gem - Venus Holdings Proprietary Limited. The prior year statement of comprehensive income did not reflect the 26% portion of the profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests and has therefore been restated. The non-controlling interest debit adjustment of \u00a369,000 reflects the 26% share of losses attributable to South African subsidiaries, in compliance with IFRS 10. This adjustment aligns with the proportional allocation of equity ownership within the Group.\nThe earnings per share have been restated as the adjustment affects the profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent used as the numerator.\nDuring a review of the share premium balance it was discovered that \u00a315,000 paid by Ed Nealon in September 2023 and \u00a315,000 due by Peter Redmond was not recorded as part of the capital raise as was announced on 1 September 2023. In addition, share issue cost was overcharged by \u00a312,000 for which a refund was received in 2024. The overcharge was not recorded as a debtor in 2023. It was also discovered that fees amounting to \u00a338,000 paid on behalf of a subsidiary was incorrectly charged to profit and loss and should have been allocated against the intercompany loan account.\nImpact on adjustment on the consolidated statement of changes in equity\n30 Dec 2023\n31 Dec 2023\n(as previously stated)\nPrior year adjustment\n(as re-stated)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nIncrease in share premium\n3,938\n42\n3,980\nDecrease in non-controlling interest\n-\n(69)\n(69)\nIncrease in retained earnings\n(2,469)\n107\n(2,362)\nImpact on Profit and Loss\n(1,170)\n38\n(1,132)\nEffect on total equity\n-\n80\n-\nImpact on adjustment on the company statement of changes in equity\n30 Dec 2023\n31 Dec 2023\n(as previously stated)\nPrior year adjustment\n(as re-stated)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nIncrease in share premium\n3,938\n42\n3,980\nIncrease in retained earnings\n(2,231)\n38\n(2,193)\nImpact on Profit and Loss\n(906)\n38\n(868)\nEffect on total equity\n-\n80\n-\n(ii) Restatement of prior year statement of cash flows\nThe Group and Company have restated certain prior year comparatives to correctly present amounts in the Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nThe prior year cash flow incorrectly included non-cash movements related to the acquisition of Gem - Venus Holdings Proprietary Limited.\nAccordingly, the prior year statement of cash flows has been restated to correct these errors.\nImpact on adjustment on the consolidated statement of cash flows\n30 Dec 2023\n31 Dec 2023\n(as previously stated)\nPrior year adjustment\n(as re-stated)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCash flows from operating activities\nContingent consideration\n436\n(436)\n-\n(Increase)/decrease in receivables\n10\n177\n187\nIncrease/(decrease) in payables\n50\n(418)\n(368)\nCash flows from investment activities\nPurchase of subsidiary, property plant and equipment\n(559)\n559\n-\nPurchase of property plant and equipment\n-\n(7)\n(7)\nAcquisition of subsidiary, net of cash acquired\n-\n9\n9\nCash flow from financing activities\nIssue of shares for cash, net of costs\n1,402\n(72)\n1,330\nImpact on adjustment on the company statement of cash flows\n30 Dec 2023\n31 Dec 2023\n(as previously stated)\nPrior year adjustment\n(as re-stated)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCash flows from operating activities\nContingent consideration\n436\n(436)\n-\n(Increase)/decrease in receivables\n(453)\n377\n(76)\nCash flows from investment activities\nPurchase of subsidiary, property plant and equipment\n(536)\n536\n-\nLoans provided to subsidiaries\n-\n(443)\n(443)\nCash flow from financing activities\nIssue of shares for cash, net of costs\n1,402\n(72)\n1,330\n(iii) Restatement of prior year goodwill\nThe Group and Company have restated certain prior year comparatives to correctly reflect the loan provided to Venus Emeralds Proprietary Limited in 2022. Venus Emeralds Proprietary Limited was acquired in 2023 as part of the Gem - Venus Holdings Proprietary Limited group acquisition and the loan balance of \u00a3264,000 that was impaired by GEMR in 2022, but was not included in the net asset acquired calculation in 2023.\nImpact on adjustment on the consolidated statement of financial position\n30 Dec 2023\n31 Dec 2023\n(as previously stated)\nPrior year adjustment\n(as re-stated)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nDecrease in goodwill\n1,550\n(264)\n1,286\nDecrease in other payables\n(345)\n264\n(81)\nImpact on adjustment on the company statement of financial position\n30 Dec 2023\n31 Dec 2023\n(as previously stated)\nPrior year adjustment\n(as re-stated)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nInvestment in subsidiary\n1,536\n(264)\n1,272\nIncrease in other receivables\n582\n264\n846\n13.\nEvents after the reporting date\nAs announced on 4 September 2025, the Company appointed Mr Louis Ching as Executive Chairman, and Mr Hin Shek \"Hans\" Wong as a non-executive director, as a nominee of Mr Louis Ching to the Board. Mr Edward Nealon will remain on the Board as a non-executive director.\nFurther to the above, the Company has raised \u00a32.117m (the \"Fundraise\") before expenses comprising a subscription of \u00a3617,320 from Mr Louis Ching (the \"Subscription\") and the issuance of unsecured convertible loan notes in the principal amount of \u00a31.5 million (\"Convertible Loan Notes\").\nTransaction Summary\n\u2022\nSubscription\n: Mr Louis Ching has subscribed for 308,658,088 new ordinary shares of nominal value \u00a30.0001 each (\"Ordinary Shares\") in the capital of the Company at a subscription price of \u00a30.002 per share (0.20 pence) (the \"Subscription Price\"), raising gross proceeds of approximately \u00a3617,320. Mr Ching has also been transferred one Ordinary Share by a shareholder of the Company. This results in Mr Ching holding over 50% of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company.\n\u2022\nConvertible Loan Notes\n: In parallel, the Company has issued Mr Louis Ching Convertible Loan Notes in the principal amount of \u00a31.5 million, convertible at a 50% premium to the Subscription Price (equivalent to \u00a30.003 per share (0.30 pence) (the \"Conversion Price\")). The Convertible Loan Notes carry a 5% annual interest and may be converted at any time up until 3 September 2028, subject to the Company obtaining authority from the holders of Ordinary Shares (\"Shareholders\") to issue the new Ordinary Shares on conversion of the Convertible Loan Notes (\"Conversion Shares\").\n\u2022\nConversion of unpaid fees\n: In conjunction with the above, the Company and its directors (the \"Board\") have agreed that all outstanding and accrued and unpaid board and management fees, totalling approximately \u00a3230,000 gross, will be converted into Ordinary Shares at the Conversion Price, once the Company has secured sufficient Shareholder authority to increase its headroom for share issuance.\nOther than the above, there have been no significant events between the end of the period and the publication of these accounts.\n- Ends -\nFor further information please contact:\nGem Resources plc\nChief Executive Officer\nBernard Olivier\nDirector\nPeter Redmond\nChief Operating Officer\nJeremy Sturgess-Smith\n+44 (0)746 368 6497\ninfo@gemresources.co.uk\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nJoint Corporate Broker\nLucy Williams\nDuncan Vasey\nCapital Plus Partners\nJoint Corporate Broker\nKeith Swann\nJon Critchley\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\n+44 (0)203 821 6169\n+44 (0)203 821 6168\nCMC Markets\nJoint Corporate Broker\nDouglas Crippen\n+44 (0)20 3003 8632\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
