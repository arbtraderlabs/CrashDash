Growth was led by the American consumer, supported by exports and government spending, while business investment continued to expand despite ongoing weakness in housing. Survey data suggests activity is slowing from a high level rather than rolling over, with employment holding up. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve reduced rates by 25bps and indicated that further easing is likely in 2026 if inflation continues to moderate.\nThe Eurozone remains a tale of uneven progress. Growth improved slightly, supported by higher investment and public spending, but this was offset by weak trade and persistent regional divergence. Manufacturing remains under pressure, particularly in Germany and Italy, while services continue to expand but with diminishing momentum. Overall, the region remains resilient but fragile, leaving the European Central Bank in no rush to materially change policy.\nIn the UK, economic growth remained muted, with Q3 GDP rising just 0.1%. Manufacturing returned to modest expansion in November, with output and new orders improving after a prolonged downturn, but employment continued to decline as higher labour and input costs weighed on hiring. Services showed clearer momentum in December on stronger domestic and overseas demand. Inflation eased further, with CPI slowing to 3.2% in November, The Bank of England cut rates by 25bps, signalling a cautious and data dependent path ahead.\nEquity markets were mixed in December. Global equities recovered modestly, with the MSCI World Index up 0.73%. US markets were weaker with the S&P 500 slipping 0.05% and the Nasdaq falling 0.53%, while UK equities outperformed, with the FTSE 100 up 2.17%, the FTSE 250 up 1.38%, and Small Cap and AIM indices gaining 1.85% and 1.63%, respectively.\nOur portfolio performance was weighed down by negative sentiment toward UK financials, particularly AJ Bell, following Autumn Budget changes affecting pensions and savings. These policy shifts created short-term uncertainty around client behaviour, despite no deterioration in underlying business quality. We used this weakness to add to AJ Bell and trimmed our holding in Liontrust. The portfolio declined by 1.89% in December with the NAV down by 2.31% after allowing for expenses.\nAt the company level, AJ Bell delivered record FY25 results, with strong growth in revenue, profits and earnings per share, alongside a higher dividend and a further \u00a350m share buyback. Net inflows remained robust and management continues to invest for long-term growth. Begbies Traynor reported steady H1 progress, with revenue and profit growth, a higher interim dividend, and continued strength in counter-cyclical advisory services. Impax Asset Management ended the year with \u00a326.1bn of assets under management and remains focused on long-term sustainability themes.\nThe largest contributors to performance were S&U, NWF Group, and Dunelm, while AJ Bell, Impax, and Auto Trader were the main detractors, a reminder that short-term market sentiment often diverges from long-term business value and success.\nFact Sheet\nAn accompanying fact sheet which includes the information above as well as wider details on the portfolio can be found on the Fund's website\nwww.athelneytrust.co.uk\nunder \"About\" then select \"Latest Monthly Fact Sheet\".\nBackground Information\nDr. Emmanuel (Manny) Pohl AM\nManny is Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of E C Pohl & Co (\"ECP\"), an investment management company and has been a major shareholder in Athelney trust for many years.\nE C Pohl & co is licensed by the Australian Financial services (license no.421704).\nwww.ecpohl.com\nwww.ecpam.com\nManny Pohl and the ECP group has AUD2.7bn (\u00a31.5 billion) under its management including four listed investment companies, three listed in Australia and one in the UK:\n\u00b7\nFlagship Investments (ASX code:FSI)\nhttps://flagshipinvestments.com.au\n\u00b7\nECP Emerging Growth (ASX code: ECP)\nhttps://ecpam.com/emerging\n\u00b7\nGlobal Masters Fund Limited (ASX code: GFL)\nwww.globalmastersfund.com.au\n\u00b7\nAthelney Trust plc (LSE code: ATY)\nwww.athelneytrust.co.uk\nAthelney Trust plc Investment Policy\nThe investment objective of the Trust is to provide shareholders with prospects of long-term capital growth with the risks inherent in small cap investment minimised through a spread of holdings in quality small cap companies that operate in various industries and sectors. The Fund Manager also considers that it is important to maintain a progressive dividend record.\nThe assets of the Trust are allocated predominantly to companies with either a full listing on the London Stock Exchange or a trading facility on AIM or ISDX. The assets of the Trust have been allocated in two main ways: first, to the shares of those companies which have grown steadily over the years in terms of profits and dividends but, despite this progress, the market rating is favourable when compared to future earnings and dividends; second, to those companies whose shares are standing at a favourable level compared with the value of land, buildings or cash in the balance sheet.\nAthelney Trust was founded in 1994. In 1996 it was one of the ten pioneer members of the Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\"). In 2008 the shares became fully listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Athelney Trust has a successful progressive dividend growth record and the dividend has grown every year since 2004. According to the Association of Investment Companies (AIC) Athelney Trust is a \"Dividend Hero\" being one of only a few investment companies that have increased their dividend every year for 20 years or more.

Growth was driven by a sizeable upward revision in consumer spending, with services and goods both showing solid momentum. Inflation edged up to 3.0% in September, lifted by firmer energy prices. Manufacturing activity eased slightly but continued to improve overall, while the services sector strengthened to its fastest pace since July on strong customer demand. Business confidence rose to an 11-month high.\nThe Eurozone economy grew 0.2% in Q3 2025, a slight improvement from Q2. Spain and France led the bloc with solid consumer demand and export rebounds, while Germany and Italy stagnated. Manufacturing weakened, with factory activity slipping as orders and employment fell. By contrast, the services sector continued to strengthen, reaching its fastest pace of expansion in 18 months. Inflation held at 2.1%, broadly in line with the ECB's target, though services inflation rose to 3.4%. Overall, the region remains resilient, reducing pressure on the ECB to cut rates further.\nThe UK economy grew just 0.1% in Q3 2025, down from 0.3%, as manufacturing contracted sharply following cyber-related disruptions at Jaguar Land Rover. Services held up modestly, while construction growth nearly stalled. Inflation eased to 3.6% in October, helped by sharp declines in gas and electricity prices, while core inflation slipped to a six-month low. Manufacturing showed a modest return to growth, while the services sector lost momentum as businesses held back ahead of the Budget and demand softened. Firms cut staff and focused on tech investment as input cost pressures moderated.\nGlobal equities were driven by fears of an AI-investment bubble, as fund managers warned that tech giants were overspending on data centres and infrastructure. This shift in sentiment fuelled volatility and coincided with the first global equity fund outflows after a nine-week buying streak. The MSCI World Index ended the month up a 0.18%. In the United States, the S&P 500 gained 0.13% while the Nasdaq Composite fell by 1.51%. In the UK, large caps ended flat with the FTSE 100 up a modest 0.03%. The FTSE 250 declined by 0.03% while the FTSE Small Cap and AIM indexes underperformed, declining 0.37% and 2.37% respectively.\nNovember's volatility hit our portfolio, specifically some of our smaller growth companies namely PayPoint Plc and NWF Group. Our Net Asset Value (NAV) total return for November was -2.96% after fees and expenses. During the month, we added to our holdings in CakeBox and Liontrust and trimmed our holdings in Dunelm, S&U and NWF Group.\nGames Workshop delivered standout results with FY25 revenue up 17%, and net income rising 30%, while Auto Trader saw H1 revenue rise 5%, operating profit up 6%, and EPS up 11% to 17.26p. Liontrust reported a FY25 revenue decline of 14% with \u00a32.3bn in net outflows and AUM of \u00a322bn. Cake Box delivered 53.5% H1 revenue growth to \u00a328.8m, with EBITDA up 31% and raised its interim dividend by 5.9%. PayPoint delivered solid H1 FY26 growth with revenue up 6.7% to \u00a3144.1m.\nThe largest contributors to portfolio performance were Games Workshop, and 4Imprint Group, each gaining over 15%, while PayPoint, NWF, and RMV were the main detractors.\nFact Sheet\nAn accompanying fact sheet which includes the information above as well as wider details on the portfolio can be found on the Fund's website\nwww.athelneytrust.co.uk\nunder \"About\" then select \"Latest Monthly Fact Sheet\".\nBackground Information\nDr. Emmanuel (Manny) Pohl AM\nManny is Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of E C Pohl & Co (\"ECP\"), an investment management company and has been a major shareholder in Athelney trust for many years.\nE C Pohl & co is licensed by the Australian Financial services (license no.421704).\nwww.ecpohl.com\nwww.ecpam.com\nManny Pohl and the ECP group has AUD2.7bn (\u00a31.5 billion) under its management including four listed investment companies, three listed in Australia and one in the UK:\n\u00b7\nFlagship Investments (ASX code:FSI)\nhttps://flagshipinvestments.com.au\n\u00b7\nECP Emerging Growth (ASX code: ECP)\nhttps://ecpam.com/emerging\n\u00b7\nGlobal Masters Fund Limited (ASX code: GFL)\nwww.globalmastersfund.com.au\n\u00b7\nAthelney Trust plc (LSE code: ATY)\nwww.athelneytrust.co.uk\nAthelney Trust plc Investment Policy\nThe investment objective of the Trust is to provide shareholders with prospects of long-term capital growth with the risks inherent in small cap investment minimised through a spread of holdings in quality small cap companies that operate in various industries and sectors.

Growth was lifted by robust consumer spending and higher business investment. Inflation edged up to 3.0%, mainly due to firmer energy prices, while underlying price pressures continued to ease. The Federal Reserve trimmed rates by 25 bps to a range of 3.75-4.00%, responding to a softer jobs market. Overall, the US remains on solid footing, though the Fed is expected to ease policy gradually to keep both growth and inflation in balance.\nIn the Eurozone, annual GDP rose 1.3%, showing resilience despite weak trade. Inflation eased to 2.1%, near the ECB's target, as energy prices fell and core inflation held at 2.4%. Manufacturing activity stabilised, and services recorded the fastest growth since August 2024, supported by rising new orders and job creation. Overall, growth remains modest yet stable, giving the ECB room to delay rate cuts.\nThe UK economy grew by 0.3% in Q2 2025 over the previous quarter, supported by services and construction, while manufacturing output contracted. Consumer and government spending rose modestly, though business investment fell 1.1%. Exports weakened slightly, leaving annual GDP up 1.4%. Inflation held steady at 3.8% in September, with higher transport and hospitality costs offset by easing food and energy prices, core inflation eased to 3.5%. Recent business surveys indicated signs of stabilisation in the industrial sector and modest growth in services. Companies reported improving order pipelines, better cost control, and early signs of renewed confidence ahead of the November Budget, suggesting that economic momentum may be starting to firm into year-end.\nGlobal equities rose in October, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous month, led once again by mega-cap, AI-related names such as NVIDIA, Microsoft and Amazon. The MSCI advanced by 1.7% on broad developed-market strength. In the United States, the S&P 500 gained 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 4.8%. In the UK, large caps rose strongly on higher oil prices and a weaker pound, with the FTSE 100 up 3.9%. The FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap added 0.7% and 2.2%, respectively, while AIM stocks underperformed, declining by 1.8%.\nOur portfolio declined by 1.17% and after providing for fees and expenses the Net Asset Value (NAV) declined by 1.8%. During the month, we initiated a new position in Boku (LSE: BOKU), a global mobile and online payments platform providing direct carrier billing and digital wallets in over 90 countries. The company's capital-light model, network effects, recurring revenues, and disciplined management align well with our investment philosophy. We added to our holdings in Begbies Traynor and Dunelm, while reducing positions in Auto Trader and Treatt.\nIn October 2025, RELX reported 7% underlying revenue growth for the first nine months, reaffirming guidance and highlighting strong demand across its data and analytics divisions. Dunelm delivered a robust Q1 update, maintaining sales momentum and healthy gross margins. Liontrust Asset Management recorded \u00a31.2 billion in net outflows, with AUM declining to \u00a322 billion, though management noted improving sentiment. S&U posted a 22% profit increase, driven by better credit quality and strong growth in bridging finance. The largest contributors to portfolio performance were Games Workshop, Cake Box, and S&U, each gaining over 5%, while PayPoint, Liontrust, and Spectra Systems were the main detractors.\nFact Sheet\nAn accompanying fact sheet which includes the information above as well as wider details on the portfolio can be found on the Fund's website\nwww.athelneytrust.co.uk\nunder \"About\" then select \"Latest Monthly Fact Sheet\".\nBackground Information\nDr. Emmanuel (Manny) Pohl AM\nManny is Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of E C Pohl & Co (\"ECP\"), an investment management company and has been a major shareholder in Athelney trust for many years.\nE C Pohl & co is licensed by the Australian Financial services (license no.421704).\nwww.ecpohl.com\nwww.ecpam.com\nManny Pohl and the ECP group has AUD2.7bn (\u00a31.5 billion) under its management including four listed investment companies, three listed in Australia and one in the UK:\n\u00b7\nFlagship Investments (ASX code:FSI)\nhttps://flagshipinvestments.com.au\n\u00b7\nECP Emerging Growth (ASX code: ECP)\nhttps://ecpam.com/emerging\n\u00b7\nGlobal Masters Fund Limited (ASX code: GFL)\nwww.globalmastersfund.com.au\n\u00b7\nAthelney Trust plc (LSE code: ATY)\nwww.athelneytrust.co.uk\nAthelney Trust plc Investment Policy\nThe investment objective of the Trust is to provide shareholders with prospects of long-term capital growth with the risks inherent in small cap investment minimised through a spread of holdings in quality small cap companies that operate in various industries and sectors. The Fund Manager also considers that it is important to maintain a progressive dividend record.\nThe assets of the Trust are allocated predominantly to companies with either a full listing on the London Stock Exchange or a trading facility on AIM or ISDX. The assets of the Trust have been allocated in two main ways: first, to the shares of those companies which have grown steadily over the years in terms of profits and dividends but, despite this progress, the market rating is favourable when compared to future earnings and dividends; second, to those companies whose shares are standing at a favourable level compared with the value of land, buildings or cash in the balance sheet.\nAthelney Trust was founded in 1994. In 1996 it was one of the ten pioneer members of the Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\"). In 2008 the shares became fully listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Athelney Trust has a successful progressive dividend growth record and the dividend has grown every year since 2004. According to the Association of Investment Companies (AIC) Athelney Trust is a \"Dividend Hero\" being one of only a few investment companies that have increased their dividend every year for 20 years or more.
