ANNOUNCES US$23.5 MILLIONFINANCINGS AND ROYALTY SALE\nNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWS WIRE SERVICES OR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS RESTRICTION MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF U.S. SECURITIES LAW.\nCalgary, Alberta - February 9, 2026 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU)(AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, is pleased to announce the execution of definitive subscription and purchase and sale agreements with three related arm's length private investors (each, an \"\nInvestor\n\"), pursuant to which the Investors have agreed to subscribe, on a non-brokered private placement basis, for senior secured convertible debentures (the \"\nDebentures\n\") and new common shares (\"\nShares\n\") of the Company (the \"\nOffering\n\") and purchase a newly-created gross overriding royalty (\"\nGORR\n\" and, collectively with the Offering, the \"\nTransaction\n\")\u00a0for aggregate net proceeds of US$22.0 million after a 8.8235% original issue discount (the \"\nOID\n\") equivalent to US$1.5 million on the Debentures.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"This transaction is a strategic reset of Southern's capital structure. By retiring our existing high-cost senior credit facility and extending maturities, we are significantly reducing our cost of capital, improving financial flexibility and creating a runway to execute our 2026 development plan.\nThe structure of the transaction sees an existing shareholder step up as a long-term strategic partner through a combination of equity participation, disciplined convertible financing, and non-dilutive capital tied directly to asset-level performance. Importantly, the investment allows us to refinance debt that previously carried a substantially higher interest rate and accelerate development across our core Gulf Coast asset base where we have successfully proven significant natural gas reserves realizing premium pricing.\nWhile the U.S. continues to set record levels of Liquefied Natural Gas exports from the Gulf Coast area with significant additional capacity coming online in 2026, the proliferation of AI data centers is soon expected to have a profound effect on the robust future of natural gas demand. With this financing in place, we are focused on disciplined execution, advancing high-return development activity, with the objective of delivering sustainable, long-term value for shareholders.\"\nTransaction Highlights\n\u00b7\nUse of Proceeds: Net proceeds from the Transaction will be used to repay and retire the Company's existing senior credit facility in full and for development capital, including for the completion of two drilled uncompleted wells in Gwinville and further drilling on the Company's existing asset base, and general working capital and corporate purposes\n.\n\u00b7\nOffering: US$18.5 million gross purchase price through the issuance of: (i) 17,000 US$1,000 face value Debentures issued with a 8.8235% OID at a price of US$911.76 per Debenture for gross proceeds of US$17.0 million (net proceeds of US$15.5 million); and (ii) 30.0 million Shares at a price of CAD$0.07 (US$0.05) per Share for additional gross proceeds of CAD$2.1 million (US$1.5 million).\n\u00b7\nGORR: US$5.0 million gross purchase price of a 6% GORR in all revenue from all existing and future developed production of petroleum substances on the Company's lands as of the closing date calculated based on the Company's realized price received for each commodity, in perpetuity, payable monthly.\n\u00b7\nInterest Payments (Coupon): The Debentures bear interest at 7% per annum on the outstanding principal amount of US$17.0 million, payable quarterly in arrears.\n\u00b7\nMaturity: The Debentures will mature on December 31, 2028. The principal amount attributed to the OID, being US$1.5 million, will be repaid in cash.\n\u00b7\nConversion Price: The Debentures (excluding the principal amount attributed to the OID) will be convertible at the Investor's option into Shares at a price of US$0.073 (CAD$0.10) per Share, being a ratio of 13,700 Shares per US$1,000 principal amount of the convertible portion of the Debentures.\n\u00b7\nOwnership Restrictions: The Investor may not convert the Debentures or receive interest in Shares if doing so would cause the Investors' ownership to exceed 19.99 percent of the outstanding Shares without prior TSX Venture Exchange (\"\nTSXV\n\") clearance and shareholder approval.\n\u00b7\nChange of Control: In the event of a change of control, the Debentures will be redeemed for principal and accrued interest, though the Investor may convert prior to the closing of any such transaction.\n\u00b7\nListing and Admission: The Company has applied to have the Shares (including the Shares issuable upon conversion or interest payment of the Debenture) listed on the TSXV and admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The Debentures will not be listed on any exchange.\n\u00b7\nClosing Date: On or about February 12, 2026.\nFurther information on the Offering and GORR\nThe Debentures will mature on December 31, 2028, and bear interest at a rate of 7 percent per annum, payable quarterly. The Debentures (excluding the principal amount attributed to the OID, being US$1.5 million) will be convertible into Shares at any time prior to maturity at the Conversion Price. At the Investor's option, interest may be paid in cash or in Shares, with the number of shares determined based on the market price of the Shares and prevailing exchange rate at the time of payment, subject to approval by the TSXV. In the event that the Investor is not approved as a \"Control Person\" (as defined in the TSXV Corporate Finance Manual) on or prior to December 31, 2026, then, from and after January 1, 2027, the Debentures will bear interest at a rate of 15 percent per annum.\nThe Company intends to seek disinterested shareholder approval of the Investors as a Control Person at its next annual general meeting. Assuming full conversion of the Debentures (excluding the portion of principal attributable to the original issue discount which is to be repaid in cash), a maximum of approximately 212.35 million Shares would be issuable, in addition to the 30.0 million Shares issued pursuant to the Offering.\nThe Debentures will be secured by a first-priority security interest over all present and after-acquired personal property of the Company and its subsidiaries. This includes an Alberta law general security agreement and charges over the shares of the Company's subsidiaries. The terms of the Debentures will restrict the Company from granting liens over its property without the Investor's consent, other than customary permitted liens. The GORR will be granted as a non-possessory fee simple determinable interest in land that runs with the Company's lands as of the closing date.\nThe Transaction is expected to close on or about\u00a0February 12, 2026, or such other date as the Company and the Investors may agree, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the payout and discharge of the Company's existing senior credit facility and the approval of the\nTSXV, and will result in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of US$22.0 million\n.\nThe Debentures and Shares (including the Shares issuable upon conversion or interest payment of the Debenture) will be subject to a four month and one day hold period under applicable securities laws in Canada and the rules and policies of the TSXV.\nA new corporate presentation is now available in the presentation and events section of our website.\nAdmission to AIM and total voting rights\nPursuant to the equity element of the Offering, the Company shall issue 30,000,000 Shares for gross proceeds of CAD$2.1 million (US$1.5 million). Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the admission of the 30,000,000 Shares to trading on AIM, which is expected to occur shortly following closing of the Transaction (\"Admission\"). The new Common Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Common Shares.\nSubject to and on Admission,\nceteris paribus\n, the total number of Common Shares in the Company in issue will be 366,254,953, and this figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company.\nAbout Southern Energy Corp.\nSouthern Energy Corp. is a natural gas exploration and production company characterized by a stable, low-decline production base, a significant low-risk drilling inventory and strategic access to premium commodity pricing in North America.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nForward Looking Information.\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking information (collectively referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"target\", \"plan\", \"continue\", \"intend\", \"consider\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"could\" (or the negatives or similar words suggesting future outcomes. Forward-looking statements in this press release may contain, but are not limited to, statements concerning: Southern's business strategy and plan, including its objectives, strengths and focus; the completion of the Offering and the GORR on the terms anticipated, or at all; satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions to the Transaction set forth in the definitive subscription and purchase and sale agreements, including\nthe approval of the TSXV; the anticipated use of proceeds of the Transaction, including the payout and discharge of the Corporation's existing credit facility; and the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on a number of factors and assumptions made by Southern, which have been used to develop such statements, but which may prove to be incorrect. In addition to factors and assumptions which may be identified in this press release, assumptions have been made regarding and may be implicit in, among other things: the business plan of Southern; the receipt of all approvals and satisfaction of all conditions to the completion of the Transaction; the timing of and success of future drilling, development and completion activities; the geological characteristics of Southern's properties; prevailing commodity prices, price volatility, price differentials and the actual prices received for the Company's products; the availability and performance of drilling rigs, facilities, pipelines and other oilfield services; the timing of past operations and activities in the planned areas of focus; the drilling, completion and tie-in of wells being completed as planned; the performance of new and existing wells; the application of existing drilling and fracturing techniques; prevailing weather and break-up conditions; royalty regimes and exchange rates; the application of regulatory and licensing requirements; the continued availability of capital and skilled personnel; the ability to maintain or grow the banking facilities; the accuracy of Southern's geological interpretation of its drilling and land opportunities, including the ability of seismic activity to enhance such interpretation; and Southern's ability to execute its plans and strategies. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which have been used.\nAlthough management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Southern can give no assurances that they may prove to be correct. By their very nature, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties (both general and specific) that could cause actual events or outcomes to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Due to the nature of the oil and natural gas industry, drilling plans and operational activities may be delayed or modified to react to market conditions, results of past operations, regulatory approvals or availability of services causing results to be delayed. Please refer to Southern's most recent Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2024 and management's discussion and analysis for the period ended September 30, 2025, and other continuous disclosure documents for additional risk factors relating to Southern, which can be accessed either on Southern's website at www.southernenergycorp.com or under the Company's profile on www.sedarplus.ca.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS\nCalgary, Alberta - November 18, 2025 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, announces its third quarter financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, which are available on the Company's website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nand have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2025 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u25cf\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $4.3 million during Q3 2025, an increase of 25% from the same period in 2024, largely due to the 50% increase in Q3 2025 natural gas pricing over Q3 2024\n\u25cf\nAverage production of 12,457\n[1]\nMcfe/d (2,076 boe/d) (97% natural gas) during Q3 2025, a decrease of 11% from the same period in 2024 and an increase of 10% from Q2 2025\n\u25cf\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q3 2025 of $3.59/Mcf and $63.53/bbl, compared to $2.40/Mcf and $73.78/bbl in Q3 2024. Southern achieved an average premium of $0.52/Mcf (approximately 17%) above the NYMEX HH benchmark in Q3 2025\n\u25cf\nGenerated $1.0 million of Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n[2]\nin Q3 2025 ($0.00 per share basic and diluted)\n\u25cf\nNet earnings of $0.5 million ($0.00 per share basic and diluted) in Q3 2025, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in Q3 2024\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\u25cf\nThe Company successfully completed an oil well in the Magee Field at the end of September 2025. The well produced approximately 3,000 bbl of oil in the month of October and is currently producing at steady rates ~ 85 bbl/d of oil. The final costs for the completion were $85,000, which resulted in a payout of less than three weeks on the project.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern delivered another strong quarter, underpinned by a successful oil recompletion in the Magee Field and the continued strong performance of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well. These achievements have enhanced our cash flow and reaffirmed the depth and quality of our development inventory. With realized natural gas pricing averaging a 17% premium to Henry Hub during the quarter, our strategic positioning and disciplined execution continue to drive meaningful value for shareholders.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 4,340\n$ 3,480\n$ 13,450\n$ 12,163\nNet income (loss)\n462\n(2,062)\n(3,828)\n(7,805)\nNet income (loss) per share\nBasic\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nFully diluted\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n1,030\n552\n2,251\n3,484\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nFully diluted\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n340\n487\n2,808\n816\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nFully diluted\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n336,255\n167,243\n336,255\n167,243\nTotal assets\n50,626\n56,970\n50,626\n56,970\nNon-current liabilities\n19,826\n9,036\n19,826\n9,036\nNet debt (1)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nOperations Update\nIn late June 2025, Southern brought online the first of its three remaining drilled but uncompleted (\"DUC\") horizontal wells from the Q1 2023 drilling program, and its first Lower Selma Chalk (\"LSC\") lateral - the GH LSC 13-13 #2 wellbore. Over the first 30 days of production the well averaged natural gas rates of 3.6 MMcfe/d (99% gas), which is an increase of over 100% compared to the average of the original LSC horizontal wells in Gwinville that were drilled and completed by the previous operators. The well has continued to flow throughout the quarter as per expectations, achieving an IP90 rate of 2.9 MMcfe/d.\nSouthern implemented stimulation design changes that improved the predictability and speed of the fracture operations, and most importantly, reduced the Company's overall expected completion cost for future horizontal wells down to ~ $1.8 million per well. Incorporating planned design changes on the drilling side, Southern now expects the full drill, complete, equip and tie-in cost for future Gwinville horizontal wells (5,000' lateral) to be ~ $4.0 million, which is 20% lower than the current capital estimates in the Company's third-party reserve report.\nSouthern will continue to monitor regional natural gas pricing over the upcoming months before making a decision on the completion timing of the remaining two DUC wells.\nSouthern continues to work with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") staff to resolve the ongoing transportation dispute that resulted in the shut-in of approximately 400 boe/d of production from the Mechanicsburg and Greens Creek fields. In September 2025, FERC requested certain data from the pipeline operator. Based on prescribed FERC resolution timelines and past rate determination processes, the Company now expects this issue to be resolved sometime in Q4 2025, at which point these production volumes will come back on-line. The ongoing US government shutdown has contributed to further unforeseen delays in the process.\nOutlook\nWith the recent operational success of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well completion and the Magee oil recompletion, Southern plans to leverage the resulting increase in cash flow to further strengthen its balance sheet and advance additional oil focused projects and the two remaining DUCs at Gwinville.\nThe Company continues to benefit from a fixed-price natural gas swap of 5,000 MMBtu/d at $3.40/MMBtu through December 2026, providing meaningful downside protection. Combined with improved regional pricing and a stronger financial position, Southern is well-positioned to execute a disciplined capital program focused on sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value creation.\nSouthern will continue to monitor NYMEX pricing and basis differentials and remains prepared to tactically hedge additional volumes as market conditions warrant. The Company appreciates the continued support of its stakeholders and looks forward to providing further updates as it advances its operational and financial objectives.\nQualified Person's Statement\nGary McMurren, Chief Operating Officer, who has over 24 years of relevant experience in the oil industry, has approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. McMurren is registered as a Professional Engineer with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering (with distinction) from the University of Alberta.\nFor further information about Southern, please visit our website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nor contact\n:\nSouthern Energy Corp.\nIan Atkinson (President and CEO)\n+1 587 287 5401\nCalvin Yau (CFO)\n+1 587 287 5402\nStrand Hanson Limited - Nominated & Financial Adviser\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Bellman\u00a0/ Rob Patrick / Edward Foulkes\nTennyson Securities - Broker\n+44 (0) 20 7186 9033\nPeter Krens / Jason Woollard\nAbout Southern Energy Corp.\nSouthern Energy Corp. is a natural gas exploration and production company characterized by a stable, low-decline production base, a significant low-risk drilling inventory and strategic access to premium commodity pricing in North America. Southern has a primary focus on acquiring and developing conventional natural gas and light oil resources in the southeast Gulf States of Mississippi, Louisiana, and East Texas. Our management team has a long and successful history working together and have created significant shareholder value through accretive acquisitions, optimization of existing oil and natural gas fields and the utilization of re-development strategies utilizing horizontal drilling and multi-staged fracture completion techniques.\nREADER ADVISORIES\nMCFE Disclosure\n. Natural gas liquids volumes are recorded in barrels of oil (bbl) and are converted to a thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) using a ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Natural gas volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet (Mcf) are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) using the ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Mcfe and boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf is based in an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf may be misleading as an indication of value.\nShort Term Results.\nReferences in this press release to peak rates, production rates since inception, current production rates, initial 30-day productions rates and other short-term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production of Southern. The Company cautions that such results should be considered to be preliminary.\nUnit Cost Calculation.\nFor the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas volumes have been converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet equal to one barrel unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms with NI 51-101. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\nProduct Types.\nThroughout this press release, \"crude oil\" or \"oil\" refers to light and medium crude oil product types as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"NGLs\" throughout this press release comprise pentane, butane, propane, and ethane, being all NGLs as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"natural gas\" throughout this press release refers to conventional natural gas as defined by NI 51-101.\nAbbreviations\n.

The forward-looking information contained in this press release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nFuture Oriented Financial Information\n. This press release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (collectively, \"\nFOFI\n\") about Southern's capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses, hedging, natural gas pricing and prospective results of operations and production, all of which are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in this document was approved by management as of the date of this document and was provided for the purpose of providing further information about Southern's future business operations. Southern and its management believe that FOFI has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting management's best estimates and judgments, and represent, to the best of management's knowledge and opinion, the Company's expected course of action. However, because this information is highly subjective, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results. Southern disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any FOFI contained in this document, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required pursuant to applicable law. Readers are cautioned that the FOFI contained in this document should not be used for purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein. Changes in forecast commodity prices, differences in the timing of capital expenditures, and variances in average production estimates can have a significant impact on the key performance measures included in Southern's guidance. The Company's actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nSpecified Financial Measures.\nThis press release provides various financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (\"\nIFRS\n\"), including non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and capital management measures. These specified financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Southern's method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations, adjusted working capital and net debt are not recognized measures under IFRS. Readers are cautioned that these specified financial measures should not be construed as alternatives to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. These specified financial measures provide additional information that management believes is meaningful in describing the Company's operational performance, liquidity and capacity to fund capital expenditures and other activities. Please see below for a brief overview of all specified financial measures used in this release and refer to the Company's MD&A for additional information relating to specified financial measures, which is available on the Company's website at www.southernenergycorp.com and filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\"\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n\" (non-IFRS financial measure) is calculated based on cash flow from operative activities before changes in non-cash working capital and cash decommissioning expenditures. Management uses adjusted funds flow from operations as a key measure to assess the ability of the Company to finance operating activities, capital expenditures and debt repayments.\n\"\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations per Share\n\" (non-IFRS financial measure) is calculated by dividing Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations by the number of Southern shares issued and outstanding.\n\"\nNet Debt\n\" (capital management measure) is monitored by management, along with adjusted working capital, as part of its capital structure in order to fund current operations and future growth of the Company. Net debt is defined as long-term debt plus adjusted working capital surplus or deficit. Adjusted working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities, removing current derivative assets/liabilities, the current portion of bank debt, the warrant liability, and the current portion of lease liabilities.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n[1]\nComprised of 23 bbl/d light and medium crude oil, 35 bbl/d of condensate, 0 bbl/d NGLs and 12,109 Mcf/d conventional natural gas\n[2]\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS\nCalgary, Alberta - November 18, 2025 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, announces its third quarter financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, which are available on the Company's website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nand have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2025 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u25cf\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $4.3 million during Q3 2025, an increase of 25% from the same period in 2024, largely due to the 50% increase in Q3 2025 natural gas pricing over Q3 2024\n\u25cf\nAverage production of 12,457\n[1]\nMcfe/d (2,076 boe/d) (97% natural gas) during Q3 2025, a decrease of 11% from the same period in 2024 and an increase of 10% from Q2 2025\n\u25cf\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q3 2025 of $3.59/Mcf and $63.53/bbl, compared to $2.40/Mcf and $73.78/bbl in Q3 2024. Southern achieved an average premium of $0.52/Mcf (approximately 17%) above the NYMEX HH benchmark in Q3 2025\n\u25cf\nGenerated $1.0 million of Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n[2]\nin Q3 2025 ($0.00 per share basic and diluted)\n\u25cf\nNet earnings of $0.5 million ($0.00 per share basic and diluted) in Q3 2025, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in Q3 2024\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\u25cf\nThe Company successfully completed an oil well in the Magee Field at the end of September 2025. The well produced approximately 3,000 bbl of oil in the month of October and is currently producing at steady rates ~ 85 bbl/d of oil. The final costs for the completion were $85,000, which resulted in a payout of less than three weeks on the project.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern delivered another strong quarter, underpinned by a successful oil recompletion in the Magee Field and the continued strong performance of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well. These achievements have enhanced our cash flow and reaffirmed the depth and quality of our development inventory. With realized natural gas pricing averaging a 17% premium to Henry Hub during the quarter, our strategic positioning and disciplined execution continue to drive meaningful value for shareholders.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 4,340\n$ 3,480\n$ 13,450\n$ 12,163\nNet income (loss)\n462\n(2,062)\n(3,828)\n(7,805)\nNet income (loss) per share\nBasic\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nFully diluted\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n1,030\n552\n2,251\n3,484\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nFully diluted\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n340\n487\n2,808\n816\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nFully diluted\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n336,255\n167,243\n336,255\n167,243\nTotal assets\n50,626\n56,970\n50,626\n56,970\nNon-current liabilities\n19,826\n9,036\n19,826\n9,036\nNet debt (1)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nOperations Update\nIn late June 2025, Southern brought online the first of its three remaining drilled but uncompleted (\"DUC\") horizontal wells from the Q1 2023 drilling program, and its first Lower Selma Chalk (\"LSC\") lateral - the GH LSC 13-13 #2 wellbore. Over the first 30 days of production the well averaged natural gas rates of 3.6 MMcfe/d (99% gas), which is an increase of over 100% compared to the average of the original LSC horizontal wells in Gwinville that were drilled and completed by the previous operators. The well has continued to flow throughout the quarter as per expectations, achieving an IP90 rate of 2.9 MMcfe/d.\nSouthern implemented stimulation design changes that improved the predictability and speed of the fracture operations, and most importantly, reduced the Company's overall expected completion cost for future horizontal wells down to ~ $1.8 million per well. Incorporating planned design changes on the drilling side, Southern now expects the full drill, complete, equip and tie-in cost for future Gwinville horizontal wells (5,000' lateral) to be ~ $4.0 million, which is 20% lower than the current capital estimates in the Company's third-party reserve repo",

The operation was completed safely and under budget\n\u00b7\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q2 2025 of $3.63/Mcf and $62.60/bbl, compared to $2.26/Mcf and $80.06/bbl in Q2 2024. Southern achieved an average premium of $0.19/Mcf (approximately 6%) above the NYMEX HH benchmark in Q2 2025\n\u00b7\nGenerated $0.6 million of Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations2 in Q2 2025 ($0.00 per share basic and diluted)\n\u00b7\nNet loss of $0.4 million ($0.00 per share basic and diluted) in Q2 2025, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in Q2 2024\n\u00b7\nOn April 8, 2025, Southern closed an equity financing raising aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 million (approximately \u00a33.9 million, C$7.2 million) through the issuance of a total of 102,482,673 new units\n(see \"\nShareholders' Equity - Share Capital\n\" in the June 30, 2025 MD&A for full details)\n\u00b7\nOn April 8, 2025, Southern converted the remaining convertible debentures in the amount of $3.1 million into 62,759,286 new units and issued 1,627,170\nnew units for all accrued and unpaid interest (see \"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - Debenture Financing\n\" in the June 30, 2025 MD&A for full details of the conversion)\n1\nComprised of 23 bbl/d light and medium crude oil, 43 bbl/d of condensate, 5 bbl/d NGLs and 10,869 Mcf/d conventional natural gas\n2\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\"\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern continued to build momentum through the second quarter of 2025, supported by firming natural gas prices and the successful completion in late June of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well in our Gwinville field, marking a key milestone in the redevelopment of our LSC inventory. Early flowback results are highly encouraging and we are particularly pleased to have completed this well at 10% below our original budget, accelerating expected payouts and reinforcing the economic viability of our broader development program.\nFollowing our $5.0 million financing in April, Southern resumed field operations with a focus on efficiency and value creation. The GH LSC 13-13 #2 well has already begun contributing significant new volumes with minimal incremental operating cost and benefited from an approximate 17% premium to Henry Hub pricing due to rising Southeast U.S. power demand during the start of summer. This premium underscores the strategic advantage of our geographic positioning and the strengthening macro backdrop.\nLooking ahead, we expect these new volumes to materially enhance our Q3 2025 cash flow profile. With a constructive outlook for natural gas pricing into the back half of 2025 and into 2026, combined with two additional high-quality DUCs, a deep inventory of drilling opportunities and ongoing capital discipline, Southern is well-positioned to deliver meaningful shareholder value through the remainder of the year and beyond.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 3,989\n$ 3,889\n$ 9,110\n$ 8,683\nNet loss\n(411)\n(2,622)\n(4,290)\n(5,743)\nNet loss per share\nBasic\n(0.00)\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\nFully diluted\n(0.00)\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n592\n770\n1,221\n2,932\nAdjusted funds flow from operatio",

UPON PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nSOUTHERN ENERGY CORP. ANNOUNCES GWINVILLE LOWER SELMA CHALK COMPLETION RESULTS\nCalgary, Alberta - July 29, 2025 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, is pleased to announce the preliminary results from its recent Lower Selma Chalk (\"LSC\") horizontal well completion in the Gwinville Field.\nIn late June 2025, Southern successfully completed the first of its three remaining drilled but uncompleted (\"DUC\") horizontal wells from the Q1 2023 drilling program, the GH LSC 13-13 #2 wellbore. Over the first 30 days of production, the well averaged natural gas rates of 3.6 MMcfe/d (99% gas). This is an increase of > 100% compared to the average of the original LSC horizontal wells in Gwinville that were drilled and completed by previous operators. The well has been flowing directly to Company facilities with all gas sold since June 26, 2025.\nSouthern safely and efficiently stimulated the well with 25 fracture stages, placing over 5.3 million lbs of proppant into the wellbore. This is a 70% increase in proppant intensity compared to the original LSC horizontal wells at Gwinville. Southern implemented targeted stimulation design changes for this first LSC horizontal completion that improved the predictability and speed of the fracture operations, and most importantly, reduced the overall completion cost down to US$2.2 million which is over 10% below pre-job estimates. Additionally, water flowback rates from the LSC reservoir have been over 70% lower than Southern's Upper Selma Chalk horizontal wells, which translates into significant initial operating cost savings of ~ $0.20/Mcfe, further improving capital returns.\nWith these further cost improvements, the Company now estimates the total capital required to drill, complete, tie-in and equip capital for future Gwinville LSC horizontal wells to be approximately $4.0 million - a reduction of over 20% from previous management estimates and significantly below the $5.0 million estimates in the Company's third-party reserve report\n(1)\n. Based on a revised LSC type curve with an IP30 rate of 3.6 MMcf/d and a capital cost of $4.0 million, Southern calculates a break-even (15% IRR) at a Henry Hub price of $3.70/MMBtu. This is consistent with previous estimates that assumed higher initial production rates and higher costs and remains competitive with other dry natural gas plays.\nSouthern will continue to monitor both regional natural gas pricing and well performance from the GH LSC 13-13 #2 over the upcoming months before making a decision on the completion timing of the remaining two DUC wells and will update the market at that time. The remaining two DUC wellbores have been drilled in the LSC and City Bank formations.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"We are very pleased with the early flowback results of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well that will help us establish a long-awaited type curve for the remaining potential 60+ LSC horizontal locations in our vast Gwinville inventory. We expect the lower decline from the LSC reservoir to support the ~ 3.5 Bcfe recovery per well predicted by both management and our third-party reserve evaluator. The Southern operations team has safely executed this operation at 10% below our original completion estimate, which not only drives a much quicker payout on this capital but will also allow Southern to start redeveloping the Gwinville Field much sooner as natural gas prices are still expected to improve materially into the back half of 2025 and continue into 2026.\nFrom a revenue generation perspective, since bringing these significant new production volumes on-line in late June with minimal incremental operating costs, Southern has also greatly benefited from a daily natural gas basis premium of approximately\n17\n% above Henry Hub pricing due to the start of warmer seasonal temperatures and associated natural gas fired power demand in the southeast U.S. which we expect to continue or improve throughout the summer. We look forward to providing these improved cash flow results from additional Q3 volumes in November 2025.\"\nQualified Person's Statement\nGary McMurren, Chief Operating Officer, who has over 24 years of relevant experience in the oil industry, has approved the technical information contained in this announcement.

Natural gas prices showed early signs of recovery in the quarter, supported by strengthening demand fundamentals, from a colder than expected winter and tightening supply.\nRobust natural gas pricing in Q1 2025 enabled Southern to achieve a $0.49/Mcf (13%) premium to the Henry Hub benchmark price. We remain encouraged by the macro outlook with strong demand forecasts, tied to lower storage levels compared to last year. Feed gas demand from U.S. LNG export facilities continues to rise, with the Golden Pass terminal and pipeline expected to begin receiving gas this year. Domestic consumption is also strengthening, led by growing power demand from data centers and widespread electrification of the economy. Combined with continued capital discipline across the upstream sector, we believe these dynamics will support a tighter U.S. natural gas balance throughout the year, which we aim to capitalise on.\nWith the recent financing complete and natural gas prices firming, we are excited to resume field operations, beginning with the first of three drilled but uncompleted wells in our Gwinville area. We have secured key services and will shortly commence operations on the 13-13 #2 Lower Selma Chalk horizontal well, with first production expected in June.\nSouthern remains committed to creating long-term shareholder value through disciplined capital deployment, operational efficiency, and strategic advantages of our asset base. With improving market tailwinds and a clear path to near-term production growth, we are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2025\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended March 31,\n(0",

Field operations are scheduled to commence on the 13-13 #2 Lower Selma Chalk horizontal well in the next few weeks, and Southern expects first production from the well during June 2025. This will be the Company's first of three planned DUC completions at Gwinville.\nUnrelated to Southern's current growth plans at Gwinville, Southern is involved in an ongoing dispute in which it is bringing a claim regarding what it believes are excessive transportation fees being charged by a third party midstream company associated with the Mechanicsburg and Green's Creek fields. On April 29, 2025, Southern was pleased to receive confirmation that the pipelines subject to the dispute are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"\nFERC\n\"). The third party made its initial response filing to the regulator which includes setting maximum allowable transportation rates, subject to FERC review and approval.\nSouthern will work closely with FERC staff to expedite the rate determination process and, in parallel, will continue to engage with the pipeline operator to pursue an agreement on an equitable fee structure.\nIn the interim, Southern has elected to voluntarily shut-in approximately 400 boepd of production from the Mechanicsburg and Greens Creek Fields to avoid increasing the quantum of disputed fees. This accounts for approximately 20% of Southern's production on a volumetric basis, but only approximately 10% of the Company's operating income from Q1 2025.

A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms with National Instrument 51-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\nForward Looking Statements\n.

Forward-looking information typically contains statements with words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"propose\", \"project\" or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward-looking information in this announcement may include, but is not limited to: Southern's business, strategy, objectives, strengths and focus; the anticipated listing of the Warrants on the facilities of the TSXV and timing thereof. The forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Southern, including the timing of and success of future drilling, development and completion activities, the performance of existing wells, the performance of new wells, the availability and performance of facilities and pipelines, the geological characteristics of Southern's properties, the characteristics of its assets, the successful application of drilling, completion and seismic technology, benefits of current commodity pricing hedging arrangements, prevailing weather conditions, prevailing legislation affecting the oil and gas industry, commodity prices, royalty regimes and exchange rates, the application of regulatory and licensing requirements, the availability of capital, labour and services, the creditworthiness of industry partners and the ability to source and complete asset acquisitions.\nAlthough Southern believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward- looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Southern can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to: risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses, and health, ",

As we add material new production in a much higher U.S. natural gas price environment, with the current average for the remainder of the year at >US$4.00/MMbtu (equivalent to C$5.65/MMbtu), we expect shareholders will benefit significantly in the near-term.\nWith anticipated IRRs of over 80% for our Gwinville DUCs, the allocation of our capital here is expected to be highly accretive to shareholders and allow us to boost production at a resurgent time for the US natural gas market. Longer term, we have identified over 100 additional horizontal locations at Gwinville, which gives Southern the running room for further growth alongside many other exciting higher liquids weighting hydrocarbon targets in our portfolio. I'd like to welcome our new shareholders to the register and thank current shareholders for their support as we enter a period of positive momentum for Southern's compelling growth story.\"\nProspectus Offering and Placing\nResearch Capital Corporation acted as sole agent and sole bookrunner (the \"\nCanadian Bookrunner\n\") in connection with the Prospectus Offering.

Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are available on the Company's website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nand have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $3.5 million in Q3 2024, a decrease of 34% compared to the same period in 2023\n\u00b7\nAverage production of 14,018\n[1]\nMcfe/d (2,336 boe/d) (97% natural gas) during Q3 2024, a decrease of 17% from the same period in 2023\n\u00b7\nGenerated $0.6 million of adjusted funds flow from operations\n[2]\nin Q3 2024 ($0.00 per share - basic and fully diluted)\n\u00b7\nNet loss of $2.1 million in Q3 2024 ($0.01 net loss per share - basic and fully diluted), compared to a net loss of $2.4 million in Q3 2023\n\u00b7\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q3 2024 of $2.40/Mcf and $73.78/bbl compared to $2.83/Mcf and $82.65/bbl in Q3 2023 and a Q3 2024 natural gas benchmark price of $2.16/Mcf\n\u00b7\nMonetized excess inventory equipment in the first nine months of 2024 for net proceeds of $3.4 million\n\u00b7\nReduced net debt2 by $1.4 million from Q2 2024 and $3.9 million from Q4 2023\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern remains steadfast in preserving its balance sheet amid the challenging natural gas price environment of 2024. With natural gas prices on track to be the second-lowest in 24 years, we have proactively focused on optimizing our value chain. This includes generating $3.4 million in proceeds through the sale of excess equipment inventory in 2024 and reducing our abandonment liabilities by divesting non-core, non-producing wellbores during Q3.\n\"Despite the market challenges, Southern has leveraged the strategic locations of its assets and sales points, achieving a $0.24/Mcf premium (~11% basis premium) over Henry Hub benchmark pricing in Q3 2024. Additionally, our financial hedge of 5,000 MMBtu/d at $3.40, which was initiated in Q2 2024, has provided stable cash flows, enabling us to navigate ongoing volatility.\n\"Looking ahead, there are encouraging signs of price improvement as we enter winter and progress into 2025. Increased feed gas demand from Corpus Christi and Plaquemines LNG export facilities, coupled with rising domestic consumption driven by gas-fired power demand for artificial intelligence data centers and vehicle electrification, are expected to tighten the supply-demand balance. The longer-term structural case for natural gas also looks promising, as the lack of new storage capacity built will continue to tighten markets and geo-political events in Europe are expected to make US LNG more attractive.\n\"We remain committed to leveraging our strategic advantages and maintaining operational efficiencies to drive growth and shareholder value.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 3,480\n$ 5,285\n$ 12,163\n$ 14,215\nNet loss\n(2,062)\n(2,367)\n(7,805)\n(7,254)\nNet loss per share\nBasic\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\n(0.05)\n(0.05)\nFully diluted\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\n(0.05)\n(0.05)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n552\n1,071\n3,484\n2,450\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.02\nFully diluted\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.02\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n487\n1,734\n816\n41,918\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n167,227\n139,086\n166,737\n138,907\nFully diluted\n167,227\n139,086\n166,737\n138,907\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n167,243\n139,088\n167,243\n139,088\nTotal assets\n56,970\n102,401\n56,970\n102,401\nNon-current liabilities\n9,036\n21,373\n9,036\n21,373\nNet debt (1)\n$ (22,710)\n$ (27,603)\n$ (22,710)\n$ (27,603)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nSubsequent Events\nOn October 30, 2024, Southern entered into the eighth amendment (the \"\nEighth Amendment\n\") with the Company's senior secured term loan (the \"\nCredit Facility\n\"), which includes an extension to the pause of monthly repayment of principal to December 31, 2024 and a condition that Southern shall repay $1.7 million of the outstanding principal at January 31, 2025 in the absence of a use of proceeds acc",

ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS\nCalgary, Alberta - August 20, 2024 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC) (OTCQX:SOUTF), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, announces its second quarter financial and operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, which are available on the Company's website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nand have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nSECOND QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $3.9 million in Q2 2024, an increase of 4% compared to the same period in 2023\n\u00b7\nAverage production of 15,465\n[1]\nMcfe/d (2,578 boe/d) (95% natural gas) during Q2 2024, a decrease of 3% from the same period in 2023\n\u00b7\nGenerated $0.8 million of adjusted funds flow from operations\n[2]\nin Q2 2024 ($0.00 per share - basic and fully diluted)\n\u00b7\nNet loss of $2.6 million in Q2 2024 ($0.02 net loss per share - basic and fully diluted), compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in Q2 2023\n\u00b7\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q2 2024 of $2.26/Mcf and $80.06/bbl compared to $2.18/Mcf and $72.83/bbl in Q2 2023\n\u00b7\nEntered into a fixed price swap derivative contract of 5,000 MMBtu/d for the period of May 2024 - December 2026 at a price of $3.40/MMBtu\n\u00b7\nMonetized excess inventory equipment in Q2 2024 for net proceeds of $1.4 million\n\u00b7\nExtended the maturity of the existing convertible debentures one year to June 30, 2025 (see \"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - Debenture Financing\n\" in the MD&A for more details)\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"The results in Q2 2024 underscore the Company's strategic advantage stemming from the prime locations of its assets and sales points for natural gas. Despite a quarter of depressed natural gas pricing, where some basins received close to zero dollars for their natural gas, we achieved an average sale price of $2.26/Mcf, approximately a 20% premium over the Henry Hub benchmark pricing. Additionally, our financial hedge of 5,000 MMBtu/d at $3.40 that we entered into during Q2 2024, provides stable cash flow, enabling us to navigate this period of volatility without compromising our balance sheet.\n\"In Q2 2024, we extended the maturity of our convertible debentures to June 30, 2025. Combined with the extension of our senior secured term loan in Q1 2024, these actions were crucial steps in protecting our balance sheet while natural gas prices remain low. This strategic maneuver allows us to resume growth by completing our three remaining Gwinville drilled but uncompleted wells (\"\nDUCs\n\") when natural gas prices improve. We remain focused on maintaining our low-cost structure to stay resilient through this period of natural gas price volatility.\n\"With strong summer heat throughout the U.S., increased power burn demand in July has brought storage levels back within the 5-year average. Additionally, as Corpus Christi and Plaquemines LNG export facilities begin ramping up feed gas demand, combined with the growing domestic demand from artificial intelligence data centers and electrification of vehicles, we believe the overall supply and demand balance of natural gas should improve gas prices heading into winter.\n\"We remain committed to leveraging our strategic advantages and maintaining operational efficiencies to drive growth and shareholder value.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 3,889\n$ 3,741\n$ 8,683\n$ 8,930\nNet loss\n(2,622)\n(3,767)\n(5,743)\n(4,887)\nNet loss per share\nBasic\n(0.02)\n(0.03)\n(0.03)\n(0.04)\nFully diluted\n(0.02)\n(0.03)\n(0.03)\n(0.04)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n770\n(366)\n2,932\n1,379\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.00\n(0.00)\n0.02\n0.01\nFully diluted\n0.00\n(0.00)\n0.02\n0.01\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n60\n5,292\n329\n40,184\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n166,497\n139,039\n166,489\n138,816\nFully diluted\n166,497\n139,039\n166,489\n138,816\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n166,497\n139,401\n166,497\n139,041\nTotal assets\n59,269\n104,075\n59,269\n104,075\nNon-current liabilities\n23,805\n20,961\n23,805\n20,961\nNet debt (1)\n$ (24,159)\n$ (26,158)\n$ (24,159)\n$ (26,158)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nO",

ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\nCalgary, Alberta - May 28, 2024 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC)(OTCQX:SOUTF), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, announces its first quarter financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which are available on the Company's website at www.southernenergycorp.com and have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nFIRST QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nAverage production of 18,055\n[1]\nMcfe/d (3,009 boe/d) (96% natural gas) during Q1 2024, an increase of 15% from the same period in 2023\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $4.8 million in Q1 2024, a decrease of 8% from the same period in 2023, largely due to the decline in natural gas pricing\n\u00b7\nGenerated $2.2 million of adjusted funds flow from operations\n[2]\nin Q1 2024 ($0.01 per share basic and diluted)\n\u00b7\nNet loss of $3.1 million in Q1 2024 ($0.02 net loss per share - basic and fully diluted), compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in Q1 2023\n\u00b7\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q1 2024 of $2.53/Mcf and $74.86/bbl compared to $3.25/Mcf and $75.73/bbl in Q1 2023\n\u00b7\nEntered into the sixth amendment (the \"\nSixth Amendment\n\") to the Company's senior secured term loan (the \"\nCredit Facility\n\"), which among other amendments, included extending the term of the Credit Facility from August 31, 2025 to December 31, 2026 (see \"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility\n\" in the March 31, 2024 MD&A for full details of the amendment)\n\u00b7\nMonetized the Company's fixed price swap derivative contracts to take advantage of the positive unrealized gain position, realizing net proceeds of $1.1 million\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\u00b7\nEntered into a fixed price swap derivative contract of 5,000 MMBtu/d for the period of May 2024 - December 2026 at a price of $3.40/MMBtu\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"The Company's Q1 2024 results show the resilience of our business in an environment which experienced one of the warmest winters in U.S. recorded history. Along with the warm weather came low heating demand for natural gas and supressed pricing. Our focus has been on improving our already low-cost structure, which our operations team has done an excellent job of executing. As we look to the second quarter and second half of our financial year, we are already seeing a significant recovery in excess of 50% from the recent lows in natural gas pricing which we expect will allow us to re-initiate growth in completing one of the three remaining Gwinville drilled but uncompleted wells (\"\nDUCs\n\").\n\"While low natural gas prices may have been a feature for the period, the recent correction in U.S. natural gas prices along with the structural dynamics of the market are extremely encouraging for a business with Southern's exposure to natural gas. As the price weakness during the first quarter was met with a significant cut in production from several of the large U.S. gas producers, demand from seven of the largest LNG export plants, including Freeport LNG in Texas, continue to experience significant increases. This huge demand driver for U.S. natural gas is only set to increase further as new Gulf Coast LNG export facilities start accepting feed gas later this summer as well as growing domestic demand from artificial intelligence data centers and electrification of vehicles. Additionally, with the early heat in the U.S. Southeast, we are seeing basis premiums where we sell a portion of our natural gas of close to $1.00/MMBtu for the summer.\n\"We remain focussed on costs with a solid balance sheet and retain our position of being able to capitalise on gas prices by bringing on increased volumes in short order. As gas maintains its position as a crucial part of future energy security in the U.S., we see a significant re-rating opportunity in the current share price and we look forward to updating shareholders as we unlock the value in our portfolio.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended March 31,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2024\n2023\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 4,794\n$ 5,189\nNet loss\n(3,121)\n(1,120)\nNet loss per share\nBasic\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\nFully diluted\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n2,162\n1,745\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.01\n0.01\nFully diluted\n0.01\n0.01\nCapital expenditures a",

ANNOUNCESPRELIMINARY GWINVILLE COMPLETION RESULTS\nCalgary, Alberta - January 16, 2024 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC)(OTCQX:SOUTF), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, is pleased to announce the preliminary results from its recent Upper Selma Chalk horizontal well completion in the Gwinville Field. In mid-December 2023, Southern successfully completed the first of its four drilled but uncompleted (\"\nDUC\n\") wells from the Company's Q1 2023 drilling program - the GH 14-06 #3 wellbore. Over the first 20 days of production, natural gas rates from the well exceeded 6.5 MMcf/d and averaged 5.3 MMcf/d under restricted flowing conditions as the well cleans up, recovering approximately 33% of load fluid to-date with gas produced flowing directly to Company owned facilities with all volumes sold.\nSouthern implemented a number of stimulation design changes for this latest Upper Selma Chalk horizontal completion that improved the predictability and efficiency of the fracture operation and, more importantly, reduced the overall completion cost down to US$2.1 million, well below budget estimates. Costs for this completion operation are approximately 40% lower than the two previous 18-10 pad Upper Selma Chalk wells that were completed earlier in 2023.\nSouthern will continue to monitor the early production performance from the GH 14-06 #3 well over the next couple of months before making a decision on the completion timing of the remaining three DUC wells. The remaining DUC wellbores have been drilled in the Lower Selma Chalk (2) and City Bank formations.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"We are extremely excited to deliver the results of this latest Upper Selma Chalk horizontal well, which we expect to fall in-line with our Gen 2 IP30 type curve estimates. The Southern operations team has successfully analyzed and optimized our early well results to execute what may be our best well to-date, for a fraction of the cost of the prior well completions which bodes well for future well activity. Southern is already selling volumes of gas associated with its latest well at gas prices up over 30% from November lows. Improved production rates at lower capital costs will allow Southern to start redeveloping the Gwinville Field on an accelerated timeline as natural gas prices are expected to improve materially into the second half of 2024.\nWith the success of the completed well, the Company is now looking forward to deploying these successful design changes on our first two Lower Selma Chalk laterals and the next City Bank lateral that remain uncompleted. Our original City Bank horizontal completion at GH 18-10 #1 has shown no decline since being placed on production in July 2023. With these updates we remain eager to highlight the benefits of an optimized completion design performance in this formation delivering value for the business.\"\nQualified Person's Statement\nGary McMurren, Chief Operating Officer, who has over 23 years of relevant experience in the oil industry, has approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. McMurren is registered as a Professional Engineer with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering (with distinction) from the University of Alberta.\nFor further information about Southern, please visit our website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nor contact\n:\nSouthern Energy Corp.\nIan Atkinson (President and CEO)\n+1 587 287 5401\nCalvin Yau (CFO)\n+1 587 287 5402\nStrand Hanson Limited - Nominated & Financial Adviser\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Spinney / James Bellman\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited - Joint Broker\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7600\nCallum Stewart / Ashton Clanfield\nTennyson Securities - Joint Broker\n+44 (0) 20 7186 9033\nPeter Krens / Pav Sanghera\nCamarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nOwen Roberts / Billy Clegg / Hugo Liddy\nAbout Southern Energy Corp.\nSouthern Energy Corp. is a natural gas exploration and production company characterized by a stable, low-decline production base, a significant low-risk drilling inventory and strategic access to premium commodity pricing in North America.

Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which are available on the Company's website at www.southernenergycorp.com and have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2023 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $5.3 million in Q3 2023 and $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\n\u00b7\nGenerated $1.1 million of adjusted funds flow from operations\n[1]\nin Q3 2023 ($0.01 per share basic and fully diluted)\n\u00b7\nNet loss of $2.4 million in Q3 2023 ($0.02 net loss per share basic and fully diluted)\n\u00b7\nQ3 2023 average production of 16,881\n[2]\nMcfe/d (2,814 boe/d) (95% natural gas)\n\u00b7\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q3 2023 of $2.83/Mcf and $82.65/bbl compared to $10.00/Mcf and $91.93/bbl in Q3 2022, and $2.18/Mcf and $72.83/bbl in the prior quarter\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully renegotiated an increase of $2.0 million in the borrowing base of the Company's senior secured term loan (the \"\nCredit Facility\n\"), extended the availability of Tranche B to August 31, 2025 to match the term of the Credit Facility, and extended the principal amortization period of the Credit Facility by twelve months\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\u00b7\nOn November 9, 2023, closed an equity financing raising aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 million through the issuance of a total of 26,630,000 new Common Shares\n\u00b7\nIn early December 2023, the Company is mobilizing equipment to the field in Gwinville to start completion operations on the first drilled and uncompleted (\"DUC\") well at the 14-6 #3 (Upper Selma Chalk)\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern is in an extremely strong position in the fourth quarter of 2023, with prevailing natural gas prices having significantly increased and our balance sheet capitalized, enabling us to go after the organic growth opportunities in our portfolio. In Q3 2023, we completed the synergistic infrastructure modifications at Gwinville connecting the newly acquired assets to our legacy Southern gathering system. We will have reduced field compression from five sites at the time of acquiring the assets to one site, which provides significant savings in both operating costs and fuel gas. In November 2023, we completed an equity fundraise to accelerate the completion of our four drilled and uncompleted wells at Gwinville. Initial cost estimates suggest that service costs are entering back into a deflationary period, and we are excited to execute our first slickwater fracture treatment in the Gwinville program.\n\"We continue to be encouraged by the outlook of supply and demand dynamics for U.S. natural gas, as at least two of the upcoming Gulf Coast LNG export projects, at Cheniere Energy's Corpus Christi expansion and Golden Pass LNG have recently announced they are ahead of schedule. Southern is well positioned to capitalize on natural gas prices with production behind pipe which can be brought on stream in a short time frame and we are excited to continue to grow the business with our new and longstanding shareholders.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 5,285\n$ 19,151\n$ 14,215\n$ 35,387\nNet (loss) earnings\n(2,367)\n6,567\n(7,254)\n7,550\nNet (loss) earnings per share\nBasic\n(0.02)\n0.05\n(0.05)\n0.08\nFully diluted\n(0.02)\n0.04\n(0.05)\n0.07\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n1,071\n8,273\n2,450\n14,097\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.01\n0.06\n0.02\n0.14\nFully diluted\n0.01\n0.06\n0.02\n0.13\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n1,734\n3,240\n41,918\n20,216\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n139,086\n132,822\n138,907\n98,293\nFully diluted\n139,086\n148,641\n138,907\n108,671\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n139,088\n135,909\n139,088\n135,909\nTotal assets\n102,401\n90,200\n102,401\n90,200\nNon-current liabilities\n21,373\n9,613\n21,373\n9,613\nPositive net cash (net debt) (1)\n$ (27,603)\n$ 20,435\n$ (27,603)\n$ 20,435\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measu",

PROVIDES OPERATIONAL UPDATE\nCalgary, Alberta - October 17, 2023 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC)(OTCQX:SOUTF), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, is pleased to provide an update on field operations and production, as well as recent financial hedging contracts that have been executed.\nOperations Update\nProduction for the third quarter averaged 2,814 boe/d (95% natural gas), representing a 6% increase over the prior quarter and largely reflecting the impact of the synergistic Gwinville acquisition (the \"Transaction\") completed in June 2023. Current production is approximately 2,900 boe/d.\nAt Gwinville, Southern has completed the process of installing the necessary pipeline infrastructure to consolidate the two gathering systems, allowing the Company to run just one central compressor station compared to the five that were running before the Transaction. These synergies will not only remove costly rental compression and allow monetization of spare owned compressors but will also eliminate the need for approximately 250 Mcf/d of fuel gas and associated emissions which can instead be added directly into sales volumes. Additionally, the Company has recently initiated workover operations on two shut-in wells on the acquired lands to re-establish production. The wells were previously producing at a combined rate of approximately 800 Mcf/d.\nIn September, the Company attempted to mechanically remediate the casing on the 18-10 #3 Upper Selma Chalk horizontal well without success. Subsequently, the heel section of the lateral (10 of 48 stages, 1,060 feet total lateral length, and 740 feet of effective lateral length) was turned over to production and the well is currently flowing at a restricted rate of 1.2 MMcf/d. The Company is considering alternative casing remediation methods for possible execution in Q1 2024.\nIn light of the recent recovery in U.S. natural gas prices above $3/MMBtu, the Company is also in the process of re-bidding completion services in connection with the four high quality uncompleted horizontal wells at Gwinville.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"We are excited with the progress we have made with the Gwinville acquisition integration, realizing quick and incremental value for shareholders through operating cost reductions and now through the start of work to increase production on the asset. At the time of pausing our capital program in Q1 2023, in response to the price of gas reaching $2.00/MMBtu, we had made a significant investment including four drilled uncompleted horizontal wells (\"DUCs\"), incremental Company owned field compression, wellhead facilities, Company owned water disposal capacity, and well casing for future drilling. This pre-investment positions Southern to expedite our corporate growth in light of the recent improvements in the price of U.S. natural gas and the anticipated drop in the cost of services. We look forward to updating the market further as we make key operational decisions in light of resurgent US natural gas prices.\"\nRecent Financial Hedging Initiatives\nWith the recent natural gas price recovery, Southern has taken the opportunity to add further hedges, both in the near term and through the 2024 and 2025 calendar years, to protect future cash flows and ensure balance sheet resiliency through the commodity price cycle. Natural gas prices have been under pressure through the beginning of 2023, with the Q2 2023 Henry Hub price averaging $2.10/MMBtu, improving to $2.55/MMBtu in Q3 2023, and is currently at approximately $3.20/MMBtu. The Company's hedge contracts, listed below, will ensure a strong natural gas price floor, allowing Southern the ability to execute and capitalize on its organic operational plans over the coming years.\nNatural Gas\nVolume\nPricing\nFixed Price Swap\nOct 1, 2023 - Dec 31, 2023\n2,000 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.095/MMBtu\nOct 1, 2023 - Dec 31, 2023\n1,000 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.050/MMBtu\nJan 1, 2024 - Dec 31, 2025\n1,000 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.880/MMBtu\nApr 1, 2024 - Oct 31, 2024\n1,500 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.208/MMBtu\nApr 1, 2024 - Oct 31, 2024\n1,500 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.420/MMBtu\nApr 1, 2025 - Oct 31, 2025\n1,500 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.420/MMBtu\nCostless Collar\nSep 1, 2023 - Mar 31, 2024\n2,000 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.00 - $3.98/MMBtu\nJan 1, 2024 - Mar 31, 2024\n1,000 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.00 - $4.60/MMBtu\nNov 1, 2024 - Mar 31, 2025\n1,000 MMBtu/d\nNYMEX - HH $3.50 - $5.20/MMBtu\nSouthern thanks all of its stakeholders for their ongoing support and looks forward to providing future updates on operational activities and continuing to create shareholder value.\nQualified Person's Statement\nGary McMurren, Chief Operating Officer, who has over 23 years of relevant experience in the oil industry, has approved the technical information contai",

ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES GWINVILLE OPERATIONAL UPDATE\nCalgary, Alberta - August 18, 2023 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC)(OTCQX:SOUTF), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, announces its second quarter financial and operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements (the \"\nFinancial Statements\n\") and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, which are available on the Company's website at www.southernenergycorp.com and have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nSECOND QUARTER 2023 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nGenerated $0.2 million of adjusted funds flow from operations\n[1]\nin Q2 2023, excluding $0.5 million of one-time transaction costs and general and administrative costs\n\u00b7\nNet loss of $3.8 million in Q2 2023 ($0.03 net loss per share basic and diluted), compared to net earnings of $2.8 million in Q2 2022\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $3.7 million in Q2 2023 and $8.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023\n\u00b7\nOn June 1, 2023, Southern completed a strategic and highly synergistic acquisition in Gwinville of approximately 400 boe/d (99% natural gas) for cash consideration of $3.2 million (the \"\nGwinville Acquisition\n\")\n\u00b7\nQ2 2023 average production of 15,907\n[2]\nMcfe/d (2,651 boe/d) (96% natural gas), an increase of 12% from Q2 2022.\nCurrent field sales production is approximately 2,900 boe/d (96% natural gas), with four new horizontal wellbores awaiting completion operations. Once Southern commits to completing these two padsites, it is expected that all four wells could be on production within approximately eight weeks\n\u00b7\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q2 2023 of $2.18/Mcf and $72.83/bbl compared to $7.53/Mcf and $109.01/bbl in Q2 2022. The current NYMEX strip price forecast for the remainder of 2023 is averaging approximately $3.10/MMBtu, a 47% increase compared to the benchmark price in Q2 2023\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Our focus for Q2 2023 was primarily on completing and integrating the Gwinville Acquisition. We have started and will continue, to maximize operational synergies of the assets, as well as position the Company for the return to growth as commodity prices continue to improve. In addition to considerable synergistic value and high-quality drilling inventory, the Gwinville Acquisition provides Southern with access to sell gas into the Florida Gas Transmission system where, similar to Transco Zone 4, we are realizing continuous premium pricing to the NYMEX natural gas price. As the warm summer temperatures in the southern U.S. have elevated natural gas power demand and we now head into a period of slowing production growth due to lack of capital spending by the industry and incremental demand from additional LNG export capacity, we are encouraged by the outlook of supply and demand dynamics for U.S. natural gas. Southern is well positioned to capitalize on natural gas prices with production behind pipe which can be brought on stream in a short time frame.\nWe remain committed to reaching our goal of 25,000 boe/d and continue to assess opportunities to grow inorganically further building shareholder value as commodity prices continue to recover to a point where we plan to re-launch our organic growth program.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 3,741\n$ 10,311\n$ 8,930\n$ 16,236\nNet (loss) earnings\n(3,767)\n2,838\n(4,887)\n983\nNet (loss) earnings per share\nBasic\n(0.03)\n0.03\n(0.04)\n0.01\nFully diluted\n(0.03)\n0.03\n(0.04)\n0.01\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n(366)\n3,590\n1,379\n5,824\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n(0.00)\n0.04\n0.01\n0.07\nFully diluted\n(0.00)\n0.04\n0.01\n0.06\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n5,292\n10,104\n40,184\n16,976\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n139,039\n83,302\n138,816\n80,742\nFully diluted\n139,039\n101,011\n138,816\n91,796\nAs at period end\nBasic common shares outstanding\n139,041\n89,537\n139,041\n89,537\nTotal assets\n104,075\n58,347\n104,075\n58,347\nNon-current liabilities\n20,961\n10,013\n20,961\n10,013\nNet debt (1)\n$ (26,158)\n$ (12,814)\n$ (26,158)\n$ (12,814)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nGwinville Development Update\nAs previously reported in the Company's announcement on May 30, 2023, the Company concluded operations on the latest drilling campaign wh",

ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF SYNERGISTIC ASSET ACQUISITION TO CONSOLIDATE THE GWINVILLE FIELD AND RESTRICTED SHARE AWARD GRANT\nCalgary, Alberta - June 6, 2023 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\"\nor the \"\nCompany\"\n) (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC)(OTCQX:SOUTF) announces the closing of its acquisition of the remaining producing acreage in the Gwinville Field (the \"Assets\") in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi from PetroTX Energy, LLC for a cash purchase price of $3.2 million (the \"Transaction\") that was previously announced May 23, 2023.\nIan Atkinson, President and CEO of Southern, commented:\n\"\nWe are very pleased to close this highly accretive acquisition. Our team has already begun optimizing the newly consolidated assets including through marketing opportunities, with additional volumes and access to the Florida Gas Transmission sales point, which is currently receiving a strong premium to NYMEX Henry Hub, and the rationalisation of operating costs. We will continue to achieve synergies through the further reduction of operating costs and through additional marketing opportunities. This Transaction demonstrates our ability to execute high value growth opportunities at all stages in the commodity cycle and we will look to build on this through organic development of the Gwinville area in the future\n.\"\nDetails of the Transaction\nThe Assets are currently producing approximately 400 boe/d (99% natural gas) of high working interest production at less than 8% projected annual decline from over 8,500 acres of held-by-production acreage and include significant redevelopment opportunities in the Selma Chalk formation.\nThe Company anticipates that the Asset's operating cost savings of more than 30% will be realized almost immediately, primarily driven by the consolidation of infrastructure, staff, and services in the Gwinville Field. The Transaction is consistent with the Company's strategy to consolidate stable, low decline, cash flowing assets that have been historically under-capitalized at highly attractive and accretive metrics.\nTransaction Highlights\n[1]\n:\n\u00b7\nPDP PV10 value of $7.7 million, including operations synergies, representing a\nPDP PV34 valuation or a nearly 60% discount to PDP PV10\no\nThis includes expected operational synergies with a PV10 value of more than $5 million\n\u00b7\nNext twelve months cash flow of $0.9 million, representing a 3.6x cash flow multiple;\n2022 cash flow of $3.7 million, representing a 0.9x cash flow multiple\n\u00b7\nFlowing Production (WI) addition per boe/d acquired of $7,800 ($1,300/Mcfe/d), on an annual basis\n\u00b7\n1.8 MMboe PDP Reserves (WI) addition at implied price of $1.76/boe\n\u00b7\nPotential 2P Reserves (WI) addition of 14.5 MMboe\n; 20+ net Selma Chalk drilling locations identified\n\u00b7\nProjected 7% increase to sales gas volumes through fuel gas reduction\n\u00b7\nEstimated operating cost savings of more than 30% expected to be achieved through synergies with our current Gwinville acreage\n\u00b7\n239 total / 204 producing (net) wells with low future plugging liability associated with the assets\nPDP reserves, 2P reserves and PV10 in respect of the Assets have been internally estimated by the Company's Internal Qualified Reserves Evaluator (\"QRE\") and prepared in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 -\nStandards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities\n(\"NI 51-101\") and the most recent publication of the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (\"COGEH\"). \"Internally estimated\" means an estimate that is derived by the Company's internal QRE and prepared in accordance with NI 51-101. All internal estimates contained in this press release have been prepared effective as of June 1, 2023. Reserves values are based on working interest reserves of the Assets before deduction of royalties and without including any of royalty interest reserves.\nThe consideration of $3.2 million was funded through existing capacity from the senior secured term loan (the \"Credit Facility\") with Southern's current lender, who is highly supportive of the Transaction. Southern still has approximately $14.5 million of capacity remaining on the Credit Facility after closing the Transaction, which provides ample funds to complete the four drilled but uncompleted wells from the Gwinville drilling program when natural gas prices are supportive.\nRestricted Share Award Grant\nSouthern has granted restricted share awards (\"\nRSAs\n\") to certain employees, officers and directors of the Company as part of Southern's overall compensation and employee retention program, in accordance with the terms of the Company's share award incentive plan. For more information regarding the Company's compensation philosophy and practices, please see Southern's management information circular dated May 1, 2023, which is available on the Company's SEDAR profile at\nwww.sedar.com\n.\nSouthern has granted an aggregate of 1,255,800 RSAs, of which 837,500 were issued to directors and persons d",

We are encouraged by the outlook of supply and demand dynamics for U.S. natural gas and are well set to immediately capitalize on gas prices with production behind pipe which can be brought on stream in a very short time scale. Additionally, we are extremely excited to consolidate the Gwinville field with the recently announced asset Acquisition. This Acquisition, which will be seamlessly incorporated with our current operations and staff, provides significant cost synergies, stable, low-decline production and additional high quality drilling locations to compliment our current drilling inventory. These are precisely the type of accretive transactions that we are looking for to expedite reaching our goal to reach 25,000 boe/d. As a low-cost producer attracting premium pricing, we feel that we have the right assets in the right locations that will provide long term value to shareholders and continue to look for further comparable opportunities.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended March 31,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2023\n2022\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 5,189\n$ 5,925\nNet loss\n(1,120)\n(1,855)\nNet loss per share\nBasic\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\nFully diluted\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n1,745\n2,234\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.01\n0.03\nFully diluted\n0.01\n0.03\nCapital expenditures\n34,892\n6,872\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n138,591\n78,153\nFully diluted\n138,591\n7",

In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

Using a discounted balance sheet approach, SOUC has a solid margin of safety, especially at the current market capitalisation which is incredibly low, given our large cash position and realistic growth prospects. Given the macro picture, this cyclical low in HH gas will be painful and just something we have to bear. However on the flipside, I wish I could enter the stock now at the current level! A great opportunity whilst there is blood on the streets (a favourite John Templeton quote of mine). The share price is almost like a leveraged play on the HH gas price and like the rest of the sector we seem to have followed it down. We make 22% more cashflow per share for every $1 increase in HH. There are multiple catalysts from Spring / Summer to hopefully rerate HH gas so I remain cautiously optimistic.",

I doubt they will get back the $2.2m invested to complete the well never mind the $8m - $10m spent drilling it. Gross revenue will take 2 years or more to reach $2.2m . Of course that gross revenue would be subject to tax, royalty, transportation costs, water disposal costs, opex and maintenance capex The placing wasn't to complete 3 wells and drill another 2. It wasn't to get to 4000boepd by end year. It was to line the pockets of directors for another year or two whilst the whole company slowly declines inline with production and then they will try to rinse and repeat",

With 25% of global gas supplies off-limits to most of the market and with China's manufacturing sector looking to kick on post covid demand will be going up and low NG pricing (its still 2 times higher than recent historical lows) seems unsustainable short of Russia starting to give gas away for free! I believe the fall in SP here has been driven by retail investors as it has consistently dropped on small volumes. My sense is the SP has reached or is very close to bottoming. There is money to be made from NG plays that have a competitive advantage and I believe SOUC is one such company. If you need evidence go look at PXEN it's been a multi-bagger for those that got in early. I see them up anther 20-30% in the next month or two with off-take agreements and first gas in Italy ust weeks away.

A few knowledgable posters on here would have you believe the share price will be \u00a31 next week and blame the price drop on 'low volume' or 'the next drilling update' will turn the price. Don't believe any of it. European gas prices have fallen from 400p / therm to 135p in the last year and are forecast to flatline for the next 5 years so I don't see a big improvement in the price across the pond either. Suggest you go over to ADVFN and read the posts by 11_percent, he pretty much sums up the poor share performance. I think the placing was very well planned, ramp the price up and take the cash, I'm still waiting for the elusive acquisition RNS!, think I may have some time to wait. Don't be to despondent typical AIM stock I'm afraid, some you win and well you know the rest.",

If you did then you will have bagged on your investment and more than covered any loss you might have made on SOUC. The last couple of months production volumes from GH 19-3 take us to a point where the sample size is sufficient to reinforce what were early but premature  fears of abnormally high decline rates. The new wells about to come on stream will need to perform much better or the early promise of this investment will continue to dissipate. Management communications have been appalling  which as you seem to have missed it, is something else I was flagging up months ago. Maybe you would benefit from taking a more balanced and mature view of what folks have actually posted? After all PXEN will have been a painful miss if you chose to ignore me based on your opinions of what you think I do or don't know.",

The world is leaning heavily on the US & Qatar to fill the Russian gap, UK O&G explorers won't explore due to windfall tax. China and US are still arguing over balloons, and rare earth minerals are being hoarded by China stalling the green transition.  We need gas badly. Germany's gas consumption in 21-22 was on average 79twh pm. During winter its average is 108twh pm. The huge 14 Q-flex and Q-max ships built to carry Qatari LNG exports are able to carry a cargo providing nearly 6 trillion BTUs of energy, 6 Trillion btu = 1.75twh. So these big ships will provide Germany with 1.59% of its monthly gas needed during winter. The entire fleet of 14 super tankers provides it with 22% of its monthly gas consumption. You need 62 of these huge tankers arriving every month for Germany alone to replace the pipeline gas and storage. Qatar Gas Transport Company Limited, has largest LNG shipping fleet in the world, 69 vessels 31 Q-Flex 14 Q-Max. Replacing the pipe is not going to be easy and it won't be cheap. My research but DYOR Anyway, my sheet (at $3-3.5 natty) says net profit will be in the region of $52m or \u00a343m just slightly less than the cap today. US gas is currently too cheap imho. Broker has $79m in 2025 on $4.5, if i plug in $4.5 into my sheet i have $68m, so the sheets are similar. I personally see great demand for LNG and exceptional value here assuming it all goes to plan. I am a buyer down here.",

          "content": "Drill results: Results from the 18-10 pad are expected to be announced this month. The pad is targeting multi-zone potential in the Upper Selma Chalk along-side the first Gen-3 technology well drilled into the City Bank, where SOU does not have any booked reserves despite significant historical production from Vt wells. As a result, the pad could provide material reserve adds if proven successful. Remember, SOU employed directional drilling technology with this pad, which gives us confidence in the potential to see early indications of improvements relative to the 19-3 pad. M&A Potential: M&A now more important with management believing the environment is ripe for acquisitions given lower gas prices that all else equal increases the willingness to sell. Management has built an incredible database (~25k wells) and knowledge and experience around its focus area... We expect Company to target purchase of assets at close to PDP value, with the emphasis on acquiring de-risked reservoirs where it can deploy Gen-3 tech. For context, the Company\u2019s cash balance could support the acquisition of ~2,000 boe/d (2-3x; 2x its base). Capex Outlook: Management has laid out a US$78.1 MM capital budget for 1H23 which includes 13 horizontal wells targeting multi-zone potential in the Upper/Lower Selma Chalk and City Bank formation. However, with the precipitous drop in gas prices, we would not be surprised if the Company elects to defer capital until a gas price recovery. We are of the view that showing a degree of capital discipline to changing natural gas conditions and preserving undeveloped inventory for better pricing is prudent, particularly given the vast opportunity set to incrementally execute accretive M&A in the US. Pure-play exposure to premium-priced NA natural gas prices: SOU\u2019s production base is >90% natural gas, with 100% of its natural gas sales fetching floating prices that approximate HHUB in 2023, which is attracting a premium over its Canadian equivalent. Moreover, SOU\u2019s hedging strategy offers investors some of the best cash flow torque to rising gas prices, with every $1/MMbtu move in HHUB equating to a +22% increase in CFPS. SOU provides one of the best 23\u2019 debt-adjusted production and CFPS growth in the sector. Importantly, this can be achieved even when assuming Gen-2 well results. Upside to 5yr development outlook: Management is targeting organic production of ~17 mboe/d by \u201926 by drilling 15 wells per year. This maps to ~60% CAGR from 2022-2026 and supports cash flow growth of ~50% (CAGR) at strip... However based on older Gen-2 results; assumes development of the Selma Chalk only (not inc. City Bank); deeper prospective zones in the Hosston and Cotton Valley remain untapped; Co. could actually drill up to 21 wells per year. Catalysts. 1) Well results from 18-10 3-well pad; 2) Gen-3+ type curve (1Q23) \u2013 important for business planning and formal Street guidance; 3) Reserve report (March 2023); 4) M&A poten",

By 2030, new plants coming online are expected to push that capacity to around 23 billion cubic feet, according to S&P Global, requiring many more new gas wells.....

In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

I've followed a concentrated value approach into small cap cyclicals (mainly O&G) for the last 7 years. I use Sharescope Gold (with no level 2 access) for screening... SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

Using a discounted balance sheet approach, SOUC has a solid margin of safety, especially at the current market capitalisation which is incredibly low, given our large cash position and realistic growth prospects. Given the macro picture, this cyclical low in HH gas will be painful and just something we have to bear. However on the flipside, I wish I could enter the stock now at the current level! A great opportunity whilst there is blood on the streets (a favourite John Templeton quote of mine). The share price is almost like a leveraged play on the HH gas price and like the rest of the sector we seem to have followed it down. We make 22% more cashflow per share for every $1 increase in HH. There are multiple catalysts from Spring / Summer to hopefully rerate HH gas so I remain cautiously optimistic.",

The well was successfully stimulated with a 50-stage completion operation and is in early stages of completion flowback currently producing flowback water at 5% of load recovery. Southern does not expect to see peak gas rates until the well has recovered approximately 20% of load fluid based on historically stimulated vertical and Generation 1 horizontal wells in the City Bank reservoir at which time the Company will report on initial production. The Company is encouraged by the early results and looks to add significant net asset value to the reserve books in 2023 as no proven undeveloped or probable locations have been attributed to the City Bank zone to-date.\"",

Of course that gross revenue would be subject to tax, royalty, transportation costs, water disposal costs, opex and maintenance capex The placing wasn't to complete 3 wells and drill another 2. It wasn't to get to 4000boepd by end year.

With 25% of global gas supplies off-limits to most of the market and with China's manufacturing sector looking to kick on post covid demand will be going up and low NG pricing (its still 2 times higher than recent historical lows) seems unsustainable short of Russia starting to give gas away for free! I believe the fall in SP here has been driven by retail investors as it has consistently dropped on small volumes. My sense is the SP has reached or is very close to bottoming. There is money to be made from NG plays that have a competitive advantage and I believe SOUC is one such company. If you need evidence go look at PXEN it's been a multi-bagger for those that got in early. I see them up anther 20-30% in the next month or two with off-take agreements and first gas in Italy ust weeks away. Their finance manager invested 1.5 million two days ago to become a TR1 holder and he isn't on the board.",

A few knowledgable posters on here would have you believe the share price will be \u00a31 next week and blame the price drop on 'low volume' or 'the next drilling update' will turn the price. Don't believe any of it. European gas prices have fallen from 400p / therm to 135p in the last year and are forecast to flatline for the next 5 years so I don't see a big improvement in the price across the pond either. Suggest you go over to ADVFN and read the posts by 11_percent, he pretty much sums up the poor share performance. I think the placing was very well planned, ramp the price up and take the cash, I'm still waiting for the elusive acquisition RNS!, think I may have some time to wait. Don't be to despondent typical AIM stock I'm afraid, some you win and well you know the rest.",

If you did then you will have bagged on your investment and more than covered any loss you might have made on SOUC. The last couple of months production volumes from GH 19-3 take us to a point where the sample size is sufficient to reinforce what were early but premature  fears of abnormally high decline rates. The new wells about to come on stream will need to perform much better or the early promise of this investment will continue to dissipate. Management communications have been appalling  which as you seem to have missed it, is something else I was flagging up months ago. Maybe you would benefit from taking a more balanced and mature view of what folks have actually posted? After all PXEN will have been a painful miss if you chose to ignore me based on your opinions of what you think I do or don't know.",

The world is leaning heavily on the US & Qatar to fill the Russian gap, UK O&G explorers won't explore due to windfall tax. China and US are still arguing over balloons, and rare earth minerals are being hoarded by China stalling the green transition.  We need gas badly. Germany's gas consumption in 21-22 was on average 79twh pm. During winter its average is 108twh pm. The huge 14 Q-flex and Q-max ships built to carry Qatari LNG exports are able to carry a cargo providing nearly 6 trillion BTUs of energy, 6 Trillion btu = 1.75twh. So these big ships will provide Germany with 1.59% of its monthly gas needed during winter. The entire fleet of 14 super tankers provides it with 22% of its monthly gas consumption. You need 62 of these huge tankers arriving every month for Germany alone to replace the pipeline gas and storage. Qatar Gas Transport Company Limited, has largest LNG shipping fleet in the world, 69 vessels 31 Q-Flex 14 Q-Max. Replacing the pipe is not going to be easy and it won't be cheap. My research but DYOR Anyway, my sheet (at $3-3.5 natty) says net profit will be in the region of $52m or \u00a343m just slightly less than the cap today. US gas is currently too cheap imho. Broker has $79m in 2025 on $4.5, if i plug in $4.5 into my sheet i have $68m, so the sheets are similar. I personally see great demand for LNG and exceptional value here assuming it all goes to plan.

          "content": "Drill results: Results from the 18-10 pad are expected to be announced this month. The pad is targeting multi-zone potential in the Upper Selma Chalk along-side the first Gen-3 technology well drilled into the City Bank, where SOU does not have any booked reserves despite significant historical production from Vt wells. As a result, the pad could provide material reserve adds if proven successful. Remember, SOU employed directional drilling technology with this pad, which gives us confidence in the potential to see early indications of improvements relative to the 19-3 pad. M&A Potential: M&A now more important with management believing the environment is ripe for acquisitions given lower gas prices that all else equal increases the willingness to sell. Management has built an incredible database (~25k wells) and knowledge and experience around its focus area... We expect Company to target purchase of assets at close to PDP value, with the emphasis on acquiring de-risked reservoirs where it can deploy Gen-3 tech. For context, the Company\u2019s cash balance could support the acquisition of ~2,000 boe/d (2-3x; 2x its base). Capex Outlook: Management has laid out a US$78.1 MM capital budget for 1H23 which includes 13 horizontal wells targeting multi-zone potential in the Upper/Lower Selma Chalk and City Bank formation. However, with the precipitous drop in gas prices, we would not be surprised if the Company elects to defer capital until a gas price recovery. We are of the view that showing a degree of capital discipline to changing natural gas conditions and preserving undeveloped inventory for better pricing is prudent, particularly given the vast opportunity set to incrementally execute accretive M&A in the US. Pure-play exposure to premium-priced NA natural gas prices: SOU\u2019s production base is >90% natural gas, with 100% of its natural gas sales fetching floating prices that approximate HHUB in 2023, which is attracting a premium over its Canadian equivalent. Moreover, SOU\u2019s hedging strategy offers investors some of the best cash flow torque to rising gas prices, with every $1/MMbtu move in HHUB equating to a +22% increase in CFPS. SOU provides one of the best 23\u2019 debt-adjusted production and CFPS growth in the sector. Importantly, this can be achieved even when assuming Gen-2 well results. Upside to 5yr development outlook: Management is targeting organic production of ~17 mboe/d by \u201926 by drilling 15 wells per year. This maps to ~60% CAGR from 2022-2026 and supports cash flow growth of ~50% (CAGR) at strip... However based on older Gen-2 results; assumes development of the Selma Chalk only (not inc. City Bank); deeper prospective zones in the Hosston and Cotton Valley remain untapped; Co. could actually drill up to 21 wells per year. Catalysts. 1) Well results from 18-10 3-well pad; 2) Gen-3+ type curve (1Q23) \u2013 important for business planning and formal Street guidance; 3) Reserve report (March 2023); 4) M&A poten",

By 2030, new plants coming online are expected to push that capacity to around 23 billion cubic feet, according to S&P Global, requiring many more new gas wells..... A mild winter and gargantuan imports of U.S. LNG helped restore gas storage back to healthy levels. But potential outages in gas-exporting Norway, an economic rebound in China, and renewed competition for cargoes from southeast Asia if LNG prices keep falling could deplete Europe\u2019s inventories, said Eugene Kim, a research director at energy-consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. In that scenario, \u201cthe onus to refill will be even higher,\u201d he said.",

In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

I doubt they will get back the $2.2m invested to complete the well never mind the $8m - $10m spent drilling it. Gross revenue will take 2 years or more to reach $2.2m . Of course that gross revenue would be subject to tax, royalty, transportation costs, water disposal costs, opex and maintenance capex The placing wasn't to complete 3 wells and drill another 2. It wasn't to get to 4000boepd by end year. It was to line the pockets of directors for another year or two whilst the whole company slowly declines inline with production and then they will try to rinse and repeat",

In Sept \u2026 probably close to 400 boepd\u2026 but we need to wait until mid Nov to know for sure That is an awful result and blows away the board,s rationale for raising $5m in the placing. $2.2m spent completing the well which will take probably 18months just to pay that back ( not accounting for tax, royalty, transportation and the capex on drilling the well in the first place). If netback is $6 per boe ($1 per mcf) if will take 4 years to pay back the $2.2m\u2026that\u2019s a joke well",

Using a discounted balance sheet approach, SOUC has a solid margin of safety, especially at the current market capitalisation which is incredibly low, given our large cash position and realistic growth prospects. Given the macro picture, this cyclical low in HH gas will be painful and just something we have to bear. However on the flipside, I wish I could enter the stock now at the current level! A great opportunity whilst there is blood on the streets (a favourite John Templeton quote of mine). The share price is almost like a leveraged play on the HH gas price and like the rest of the sector we seem to have followed it down. We make 22% more cashflow per share for every $1 increase in HH. There are multiple catalysts from Spring / Summer to hopefully rerate HH gas so I remain cautiously optimistic.",

SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

By 2030, new plants coming online are expected to push that capacity to around 23 billion cubic feet, according to S&P Global, requiring many more new gas wells..... A mild winter and gargantuan imports of U.S. LNG helped restore gas storage back to healthy levels. But potential outages in gas-exporting Norway, an economic rebound in China, and renewed competition for cargoes from southeast Asia if LNG prices keep falling could deplete Europe\u2019s inventories, said Eugene Kim, a research director at energy-consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

The Company is encouraged by the early results and looks to add significant net asset value to the reserve books in 2023 as no proven undeveloped or probable locations have been attributed to the City Bank zone to-date.\"",

Using a discounted balance sheet approach, SOUC has a solid margin of safety, especially at the current market capitalisation which is incredibly low, given our large cash position and realistic growth prospects. Given the macro picture, this cyclical low in HH gas will be painful and just something we have to bear. However on the flipside, I wish I could enter the stock now at the current level! A great opportunity whilst there is blood on the streets (a favourite John Templeton quote of mine). The share price is almost like a leveraged play on the HH gas price and like the rest of the sector we seem to have followed it down. We make 22% more cashflow per share for every $1 increase in HH. There are multiple catalysts from Spring / Summer to hopefully rerate HH gas so I remain cautiously optimistic.",

SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

          "content": "I think for me, anyone with an investment horizon that extends over 1 year can clearly see this company is in a good position to take advantage of the global LNG export market. In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

In Sept \u2026 probably close to 400 boepd\u2026 but we need to wait until mid Nov to know for sure That is an awful result and blows away the board,s rationale for raising $5m in the placing. $2.2m spent completing the well which will take probably 18months just to pay that back ( not accounting for tax, royalty, transportation and the capex on drilling the well in the first place). If netback is $6 per boe ($1 per mcf) if will take 4 years to pay back the $2.2m\u2026that\u2019s a joke well",

ANNOUNCES US$23.5 MILLIONFINANCINGS AND ROYALTY SALE\nNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWS WIRE SERVICES OR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS RESTRICTION MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF U.S. SECURITIES LAW.\nCalgary, Alberta - February 9, 2026 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU)(AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, is pleased to announce the execution of definitive subscription and purchase and sale agreements with three related arm's length private investors (each, an \"\nInvestor\n\"), pursuant to which the Investors have agreed to subscribe, on a non-brokered private placement basis, for senior secured convertible debentures (the \"\nDebentures\n\") and new common shares (\"\nShares\n\") of the Company (the \"\nOffering\n\") and purchase a newly-created gross overriding royalty (\"\nGORR\n\" and, collectively with the Offering, the \"\nTransaction\n\")\u00a0for aggregate net proceeds of US$22.0 million after a 8.8235% original issue discount (the \"\nOID\n\") equivalent to US$1.5 million on the Debentures.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"This transaction is a strategic reset of Southern's capital structure. By retiring our existing high-cost senior credit facility and extending maturities, we are significantly reducing our cost of capital, improving financial flexibility and creating a runway to execute our 2026 development plan.\nThe structure of the transaction sees an existing shareholder step up as a long-term strategic partner through a combination of equity participation, disciplined convertible financing, and non-dilutive capital tied directly to asset-level performance. Importantly, the investment allows us to refinance debt that previously carried a substantially higher interest rate and accelerate development across our core Gulf Coast asset base where we have successfully proven significant natural gas reserves realizing premium pricing.\nWhile the U.S. continues to set record levels of Liquefied Natural Gas exports from the Gulf Coast area with significant additional capacity coming online in 2026, the proliferation of AI data centers is soon expected to have a profound effect on the robust future of natural gas demand. With this financing in place, we are focused on disciplined execution, advancing high-return development activity, with the objective of delivering sustainable, long-term value for shareholders.\"\nTransaction Highlights\n\u00b7\nUse of Proceeds: Net proceeds from the Transaction will be used to repay and retire the Company's existing senior credit facility in full and for development capital, including for the completion of two drilled uncompleted wells in Gwinville and further drilling on the Company's existing asset base, and general working capital and corporate purposes\n.\n\u00b7\nOffering: US$18.5 million gross purchase price through the issuance of: (i) 17,000 US$1,000 face value Debentures issued with a 8.8235% OID at a price of US$911.76 per Debenture for gross proceeds of US$17.0 million (net proceeds of US$15.5 million); and (ii) 30.0 million Shares at a price of CAD$0.07 (US$0.05) per Share for additional gross proceeds of CAD$2.1 million (US$1.5 million).\n\u00b7\nGORR: US$5.0 million gross purchase price of a 6% GORR in all revenue from all existing and future developed production of petroleum substances on the Company's lands as of the closing date calculated based on the Company's realized price received for each commodity, in perpetuity, payable monthly.\n\u00b7\nInterest Payments (Coupon): The Debentures bear interest at 7% per annum on the outstanding principal amount of US$17.0 million, payable quarterly in arrears.\n\u00b7\nMaturity: The Debentures will mature on December 31, 2028. The principal amount attributed to the OID, being US$1.5 million, will be repaid in cash.\n\u00b7\nConversion Price: The Debentures (excluding the principal amount attributed to the OID) will be convertible at the Investor's option into Shares at a price of US$0.073 (CAD$0.10) per Share, being a ratio of 13,700 Shares per US$1,000 principal amount of the convertible portion of the Debentures.\n\u00b7\nOwnership Restrictions: The Investor may not convert the Debentures or receive interest in Shares if doing so would cause the Investors' ownership to exceed 19.99 percent of the outstanding Shares without prior TSX Venture Exchange (\"\nTSXV\n\") clearance and shareholder approval.\n\u00b7\nChange of Control: In the event of a change of control, the Debentures will be redeemed for principal and accrued interest, though the Investor may convert prior to the closing of any such transaction.\n\u00b7\nListing and Admission: The Company has applied to have the Shares (including the Shares issuable upon conversion or interest payment of the",

Using a discounted balance sheet approach, SOUC has a solid margin of safety, especially at the current market capitalisation which is incredibly low, given our large cash position and realistic growth prospects. Given the macro picture, this cyclical low in HH gas will be painful and just something we have to bear. However on the flipside, I wish I could enter the stock now at the current level! A great opportunity whilst there is blood on the streets (a favourite John Templeton quote of mine). The share price is almost like a leveraged play on the HH gas price and like the rest of the sector we seem to have followed it down. We make 22% more cashflow per share for every $1 increase in HH. There are multiple catalysts from Spring / Summer to hopefully rerate HH gas so I remain cautiously optimistic.",

SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

By 2030, new plants coming online are expected to push that capacity to around 23 billion cubic feet, according to S&P Global, requiring many more new gas wells..... A mild winter and gargantuan imports of U.S. LNG helped restore gas storage back to healthy levels.

The Company is encouraged by the early results and looks to add significant net asset value to the reserve books in 2023 as no proven undeveloped or probable locations have been attributed to the City Bank zone to-date.\"",

Using a discounted balance sheet approach, SOUC has a solid margin of safety, especially at the current market capitalisation which is incredibly low, given our large cash position and realistic growth prospects. Given the macro picture, this cyclical low in HH gas will be painful and just something we have to bear. However on the flipside, I wish I could enter the stock now at the current level! A great opportunity whilst there is blood on the streets (a favourite John Templeton quote of mine). The share price is almost like a leveraged play on the HH gas price and like the rest of the sector we seem to have followed it down. We make 22% more cashflow per share for every $1 increase in HH. There are multiple catalysts from Spring / Summer to hopefully rerate HH gas so I remain cautiously optimistic.",

SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

In Sept \u2026 probably close to 400 boepd\u2026 but we need to wait until mid Nov to know for sure That is an awful result and blows away the board,s rationale for raising $5m in the placing. $2.2m spent completing the well which will take probably 18months just to pay that back ( not accounting for tax, royalty, transportation and the capex on drilling the well in the first place). If netback is $6 per boe ($1 per mcf) if will take 4 years to pay back the $2.2m\u2026that\u2019s a joke well",

Using a discounted balance sheet approach, SOUC has a solid margin of safety, especially at the current market capitalisation which is incredibly low, given our large cash position and realistic growth prospects. Given the macro picture, this cyclical low in HH gas will be painful and just something we have to bear. However on the flipside, I wish I could enter the stock now at the current level! A great opportunity whilst there is blood on the streets (a favourite John Templeton quote of mine). The share price is almost like a leveraged play on the HH gas price and like the rest of the sector we seem to have followed it down. We make 22% more cashflow per share for every $1 increase in HH. There are multiple catalysts from Spring / Summer to hopefully rerate HH gas so I remain cautiously optimistic.",

SOUC current price movements are definitely painful atm and slightly make the stomach churn... however cyclical lows in gas won't last forever (they never do) and the long term demand picture for LNG remains strong with global undersupply projected from 2025 onwards by the likes of Shell (their Gas Outlook), McKinsey etc. LNG developers signed nearly 34 million tons per annum (MTPA) of long-term LNG contracts in 2022,  representing a 68% increase over the last record set in 2021. Most of these contracts anchor new or expanded liquefaction projects that aim to reach financial investment decisions in late 2022 and 2023 (Deloitte - 2023 Outlook for Oil & Gas). The volatility of these kind of stocks is definitely not for everyone and tests even those with the most ice-cold detachment from investor emotions and behaviours. GLA",

In Q3 2022, SOUC had one of the lowest all-in per unit operating costs of $0.64/Mcfe and expects to continue receive a premium to Nymex for its gas in 2023, albeit at a lot lower margins for the time being. The gas price this year is a major frustration. From the presentation, I know that assuming a GEN 2 type curve, the wells at Gwinville are projected to generate an IRR of 33% @ $4 HH. GEN 3+ tech is expected to generate returns significantly better than that, however in the current climate they need to wait until gas is at least $3.25 to make the economics worthwhile... I therefore think delaying capex is sensible. I would really like management to execute some M&A, taking advantage of the low gas price, their significant well inventory data  and healthy cash balance. I think patience is key as deals often take a long time to materialise and negotiations to complete. That being said, with Southern being valued at near cash, we are definitely more of a takeover target in the short term. An approach would certainly act as a catalyst but I would hope it be rejected in light of the company's long term potential and positioning. I would love to hear others views. I think its a shame HH gas is struggling at the moment but I do think there are catalysts which should help rerate it as we approach summer...",

By 2030, new plants coming online are expected to push that capacity to around 23 billion cubic feet, according to S&P Global, requiring many more new gas wells..... A mild winter and gargantuan imports of U.S. LNG helped restore gas storage back to healthy levels. But potential outages in gas-exporting Norway, an economic rebound in China, and renewed competition for cargoes from southeast Asia if LNG prices keep falling could deplete Europe\u2019s inventories, said Eugene Kim, a research director at energy-consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
