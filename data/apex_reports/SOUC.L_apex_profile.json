ANNOUNCES US$23.5 MILLIONFINANCINGS AND ROYALTY SALE\nNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWS WIRE SERVICES OR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS RESTRICTION MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF U.S. SECURITIES LAW.\nCalgary, Alberta - February 9, 2026 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU)(AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, is pleased to announce the execution of definitive subscription and purchase and sale agreements with three related arm's length private investors (each, an \"\nInvestor\n\"), pursuant to which the Investors have agreed to subscribe, on a non-brokered private placement basis, for senior secured convertible debentures (the \"\nDebentures\n\") and new common shares (\"\nShares\n\") of the Company (the \"\nOffering\n\") and purchase a newly-created gross overriding royalty (\"\nGORR\n\" and, collectively with the Offering, the \"\nTransaction\n\")\u00a0for aggregate net proceeds of US$22.0 million after a 8.8235% original issue discount (the \"\nOID\n\") equivalent to US$1.5 million on the Debentures.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"This transaction is a strategic reset of Southern's capital structure. By retiring our existing high-cost senior credit facility and extending maturities, we are significantly reducing our cost of capital, improving financial flexibility and creating a runway to execute our 2026 development plan.\nThe structure of the transaction sees an existing shareholder step up as a long-term strategic partner through a combination of equity participation, disciplined convertible financing, and non-dilutive capital tied directly to asset-level performance. Importantly, the investment allows us to refinance debt that previously carried a substantially higher interest rate and accelerate development across our core Gulf Coast asset base where we have successfully proven significant natural gas reserves realizing premium pricing.\nWhile the U.S. continues to set record levels of Liquefied Natural Gas exports from the Gulf Coast area with significant additional capacity coming online in 2026, the proliferation of AI data centers is soon expected to have a profound effect on the robust future of natural gas demand. With this financing in place, we are focused on disciplined execution, advancing high-return development activity, with the objective of delivering sustainable, long-term value for shareholders.\"\nTransaction Highlights\n\u00b7\nUse of Proceeds: Net proceeds from the Transaction will be used to repay and retire the Company's existing senior credit facility in full and for development capital, including for the completion of two drilled uncompleted wells in Gwinville and further drilling on the Company's existing asset base, and general working capital and corporate purposes\n.\n\u00b7\nOffering: US$18.5 million gross purchase price through the issuance of: (i) 17,000 US$1,000 face value Debentures issued with a 8.8235% OID at a price of US$911.76 per Debenture for gross proceeds of US$17.0 million (net proceeds of US$15.5 million); and (ii) 30.0 million Shares at a price of CAD$0.07 (US$0.05) per Share for additional gross proceeds of CAD$2.1 million (US$1.5 million).\n\u00b7\nGORR: US$5.0 million gross purchase price of a 6% GORR in all revenue from all existing and future developed production of petroleum substances on the Company's lands as of the closing date calculated based on the Company's realized price received for each commodity, in perpetuity, payable monthly.\n\u00b7\nInterest Payments (Coupon): The Debentures bear interest at 7% per annum on the outstanding principal amount of US$17.0 million, payable quarterly in arrears.\n\u00b7\nMaturity: The Debentures will mature on December 31, 2028. The principal amount attributed to the OID, being US$1.5 million, will be repaid in cash.\n\u00b7\nConversion Price: The Debentures (excluding the principal amount attributed to the OID) will be convertible at the Investor's option into Shares at a price of US$0.073 (CAD$0.10) per Share, being a ratio of 13,700 Shares per US$1,000 principal amount of the convertible portion of the Debentures.\n\u00b7\nOwnership Restrictions: The Investor may not convert the Debentures or receive interest in Shares if doing so would cause the Investors' ownership to exceed 19.99 percent of the outstanding Shares without prior TSX Venture Exchange (\"\nTSXV\n\") clearance and shareholder approval.\n\u00b7\nChange of Control: In the event of a change of control, the Debentures will be redeemed for principal and accrued interest, though the Investor may convert prior to the closing of any such transaction.\n\u00b7\nListing and Admission: The Company has applied to have the Shares (including the Shares issuable upon conversion or interest payment of the Debenture) listed on the TSXV and admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The Debentures will not be listed on any exchange.\n\u00b7\nClosing Date: On or about February 12, 2026.\nFurther information on the Offering and GORR\nThe Debentures will mature on December 31, 2028, and bear interest at a rate of 7 percent per annum, payable quarterly. The Debentures (excluding the principal amount attributed to the OID, being US$1.5 million) will be convertible into Shares at any time prior to maturity at the Conversion Price. At the Investor's option, interest may be paid in cash or in Shares, with the number of shares determined based on the market price of the Shares and prevailing exchange rate at the time of payment, subject to approval by the TSXV. In the event that the Investor is not approved as a \"Control Person\" (as defined in the TSXV Corporate Finance Manual) on or prior to December 31, 2026, then, from and after January 1, 2027, the Debentures will bear interest at a rate of 15 percent per annum.\nThe Company intends to seek disinterested shareholder approval of the Investors as a Control Person at its next annual general meeting. Assuming full conversion of the Debentures (excluding the portion of principal attributable to the original issue discount which is to be repaid in cash), a maximum of approximately 212.35 million Shares would be issuable, in addition to the 30.0 million Shares issued pursuant to the Offering.\nThe Debentures will be secured by a first-priority security interest over all present and after-acquired personal property of the Company and its subsidiaries. This includes an Alberta law general security agreement and charges over the shares of the Company's subsidiaries. The terms of the Debentures will restrict the Company from granting liens over its property without the Investor's consent, other than customary permitted liens. The GORR will be granted as a non-possessory fee simple determinable interest in land that runs with the Company's lands as of the closing date.\nThe Transaction is expected to close on or about\u00a0February 12, 2026, or such other date as the Company and the Investors may agree, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the payout and discharge of the Company's existing senior credit facility and the approval of the\nTSXV, and will result in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of US$22.0 million\n.\nThe Debentures and Shares (including the Shares issuable upon conversion or interest payment of the Debenture) will be subject to a four month and one day hold period under applicable securities laws in Canada and the rules and policies of the TSXV.\nA new corporate presentation is now available in the presentation and events section of our website.\nAdmission to AIM and total voting rights\nPursuant to the equity element of the Offering, the Company shall issue 30,000,000 Shares for gross proceeds of CAD$2.1 million (US$1.5 million). Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the admission of the 30,000,000 Shares to trading on AIM, which is expected to occur shortly following closing of the Transaction (\"Admission\"). The new Common Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Common Shares.\nSubject to and on Admission,\nceteris paribus\n, the total number of Common Shares in the Company in issue will be 366,254,953, and this figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company.\nAbout Southern Energy Corp.\nSouthern Energy Corp. is a natural gas exploration and production company characterized by a stable, low-decline production base, a significant low-risk drilling inventory and strategic access to premium commodity pricing in North America.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nForward Looking Information.\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking information (collectively referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"target\", \"plan\", \"continue\", \"intend\", \"consider\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"could\" (or the negatives or similar words suggesting future outcomes. Forward-looking statements in this press release may contain, but are not limited to, statements concerning: Southern's business strategy and plan, including its objectives, strengths and focus; the completion of the Offering and the GORR on the terms anticipated, or at all; satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions to the Transaction set forth in the definitive subscription and purchase and sale agreements, including\nthe approval of the TSXV; the anticipated use of proceeds of the Transaction, including the payout and discharge of the Corporation's existing credit facility; and the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on a number of factors and assumptions made by Southern, which have been used to develop such statements, but which may prove to be incorrect. In addition to factors and assumptions which may be identified in this press release, assumptions have been made regarding and may be implicit in, among other things: the business plan of Southern; the receipt of all approvals and satisfaction of all conditions to the completion of the Transaction; the timing of and success of future drilling, development and completion activities; the geological characteristics of Southern's properties; prevailing commodity prices, price volatility, price differentials and the actual prices received for the Company's products; the availability and performance of drilling rigs, facilities, pipelines and other oilfield services; the timing of past operations and activities in the planned areas of focus; the drilling, completion and tie-in of wells being completed as planned; the performance of new and existing wells; the application of existing drilling and fracturing techniques; prevailing weather and break-up conditions; royalty regimes and exchange rates; the application of regulatory and licensing requirements; the continued availability of capital and skilled personnel; the ability to maintain or grow the banking facilities; the accuracy of Southern's geological interpretation of its drilling and land opportunities, including the ability of seismic activity to enhance such interpretation; and Southern's ability to execute its plans and strategies. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which have been used.\nAlthough management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Southern can give no assurances that they may prove to be correct. By their very nature, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties (both general and specific) that could cause actual events or outcomes to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Due to the nature of the oil and natural gas industry, drilling plans and operational activities may be delayed or modified to react to market conditions, results of past operations, regulatory approvals or availability of services causing results to be delayed. Please refer to Southern's most recent Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2024 and management's discussion and analysis for the period ended September 30, 2025, and other continuous disclosure documents for additional risk factors relating to Southern, which can be accessed either on Southern's website at www.southernenergycorp.com or under the Company's profile on www.sedarplus.ca.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS\nCalgary, Alberta - November 18, 2025 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, announces its third quarter financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, which are available on the Company's website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nand have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2025 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u25cf\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $4.3 million during Q3 2025, an increase of 25% from the same period in 2024, largely due to the 50% increase in Q3 2025 natural gas pricing over Q3 2024\n\u25cf\nAverage production of 12,457\n[1]\nMcfe/d (2,076 boe/d) (97% natural gas) during Q3 2025, a decrease of 11% from the same period in 2024 and an increase of 10% from Q2 2025\n\u25cf\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q3 2025 of $3.59/Mcf and $63.53/bbl, compared to $2.40/Mcf and $73.78/bbl in Q3 2024. Southern achieved an average premium of $0.52/Mcf (approximately 17%) above the NYMEX HH benchmark in Q3 2025\n\u25cf\nGenerated $1.0 million of Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n[2]\nin Q3 2025 ($0.00 per share basic and diluted)\n\u25cf\nNet earnings of $0.5 million ($0.00 per share basic and diluted) in Q3 2025, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in Q3 2024\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\u25cf\nThe Company successfully completed an oil well in the Magee Field at the end of September 2025. The well produced approximately 3,000 bbl of oil in the month of October and is currently producing at steady rates ~ 85 bbl/d of oil. The final costs for the completion were $85,000, which resulted in a payout of less than three weeks on the project.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern delivered another strong quarter, underpinned by a successful oil recompletion in the Magee Field and the continued strong performance of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well. These achievements have enhanced our cash flow and reaffirmed the depth and quality of our development inventory. With realized natural gas pricing averaging a 17% premium to Henry Hub during the quarter, our strategic positioning and disciplined execution continue to drive meaningful value for shareholders.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 4,340\n$ 3,480\n$ 13,450\n$ 12,163\nNet income (loss)\n462\n(2,062)\n(3,828)\n(7,805)\nNet income (loss) per share\nBasic\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nFully diluted\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n1,030\n552\n2,251\n3,484\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nFully diluted\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n340\n487\n2,808\n816\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nFully diluted\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n336,255\n167,243\n336,255\n167,243\nTotal assets\n50,626\n56,970\n50,626\n56,970\nNon-current liabilities\n19,826\n9,036\n19,826\n9,036\nNet debt (1)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nOperations Update\nIn late June 2025, Southern brought online the first of its three remaining drilled but uncompleted (\"DUC\") horizontal wells from the Q1 2023 drilling program, and its first Lower Selma Chalk (\"LSC\") lateral - the GH LSC 13-13 #2 wellbore. Over the first 30 days of production the well averaged natural gas rates of 3.6 MMcfe/d (99% gas), which is an increase of over 100% compared to the average of the original LSC horizontal wells in Gwinville that were drilled and completed by the previous operators. The well has continued to flow throughout the quarter as per expectations, achieving an IP90 rate of 2.9 MMcfe/d.\nSouthern implemented stimulation design changes that improved the predictability and speed of the fracture operations, and most importantly, reduced the Company's overall expected completion cost for future horizontal wells down to ~ $1.8 million per well. Incorporating planned design changes on the drilling side, Southern now expects the full drill, complete, equip and tie-in cost for future Gwinville horizontal wells (5,000' lateral) to be ~ $4.0 million, which is 20% lower than the current capital estimates in the Company's third-party reserve report.\nSouthern will continue to monitor regional natural gas pricing over the upcoming months before making a decision on the completion timing of the remaining two DUC wells.\nSouthern continues to work with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") staff to resolve the ongoing transportation dispute that resulted in the shut-in of approximately 400 boe/d of production from the Mechanicsburg and Greens Creek fields. In September 2025, FERC requested certain data from the pipeline operator. Based on prescribed FERC resolution timelines and past rate determination processes, the Company now expects this issue to be resolved sometime in Q4 2025, at which point these production volumes will come back on-line. The ongoing US government shutdown has contributed to further unforeseen delays in the process.\nOutlook\nWith the recent operational success of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well completion and the Magee oil recompletion, Southern plans to leverage the resulting increase in cash flow to further strengthen its balance sheet and advance additional oil focused projects and the two remaining DUCs at Gwinville.\nThe Company continues to benefit from a fixed-price natural gas swap of 5,000 MMBtu/d at $3.40/MMBtu through December 2026, providing meaningful downside protection. Combined with improved regional pricing and a stronger financial position, Southern is well-positioned to execute a disciplined capital program focused on sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value creation.\nSouthern will continue to monitor NYMEX pricing and basis differentials and remains prepared to tactically hedge additional volumes as market conditions warrant. The Company appreciates the continued support of its stakeholders and looks forward to providing further updates as it advances its operational and financial objectives.\nQualified Person's Statement\nGary McMurren, Chief Operating Officer, who has over 24 years of relevant experience in the oil industry, has approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. McMurren is registered as a Professional Engineer with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering (with distinction) from the University of Alberta.\nFor further information about Southern, please visit our website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nor contact\n:\nSouthern Energy Corp.\nIan Atkinson (President and CEO)\n+1 587 287 5401\nCalvin Yau (CFO)\n+1 587 287 5402\nStrand Hanson Limited - Nominated & Financial Adviser\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Bellman\u00a0/ Rob Patrick / Edward Foulkes\nTennyson Securities - Broker\n+44 (0) 20 7186 9033\nPeter Krens / Jason Woollard\nAbout Southern Energy Corp.\nSouthern Energy Corp. is a natural gas exploration and production company characterized by a stable, low-decline production base, a significant low-risk drilling inventory and strategic access to premium commodity pricing in North America. Southern has a primary focus on acquiring and developing conventional natural gas and light oil resources in the southeast Gulf States of Mississippi, Louisiana, and East Texas. Our management team has a long and successful history working together and have created significant shareholder value through accretive acquisitions, optimization of existing oil and natural gas fields and the utilization of re-development strategies utilizing horizontal drilling and multi-staged fracture completion techniques.\nREADER ADVISORIES\nMCFE Disclosure\n. Natural gas liquids volumes are recorded in barrels of oil (bbl) and are converted to a thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) using a ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Natural gas volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet (Mcf) are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) using the ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Mcfe and boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf is based in an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf may be misleading as an indication of value.\nShort Term Results.\nReferences in this press release to peak rates, production rates since inception, current production rates, initial 30-day productions rates and other short-term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production of Southern. The Company cautions that such results should be considered to be preliminary.\nUnit Cost Calculation.\nFor the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas volumes have been converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet equal to one barrel unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms with NI 51-101. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\nProduct Types.\nThroughout this press release, \"crude oil\" or \"oil\" refers to light and medium crude oil product types as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"NGLs\" throughout this press release comprise pentane, butane, propane, and ethane, being all NGLs as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"natural gas\" throughout this press release refers to conventional natural gas as defined by NI 51-101.\nAbbreviations\n.

The forward-looking information contained in this press release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nFuture Oriented Financial Information\n. This press release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (collectively, \"\nFOFI\n\") about Southern's capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses, hedging, natural gas pricing and prospective results of operations and production, all of which are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in this document was approved by management as of the date of this document and was provided for the purpose of providing further information about Southern's future business operations. Southern and its management believe that FOFI has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting management's best estimates and judgments, and represent, to the best of management's knowledge and opinion, the Company's expected course of action. However, because this information is highly subjective, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results. Southern disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any FOFI contained in this document, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required pursuant to applicable law. Readers are cautioned that the FOFI contained in this document should not be used for purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein. Changes in forecast commodity prices, differences in the timing of capital expenditures, and variances in average production estimates can have a significant impact on the key performance measures included in Southern's guidance. The Company's actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nSpecified Financial Measures.\nThis press release provides various financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (\"\nIFRS\n\"), including non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and capital management measures. These specified financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Southern's method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations, adjusted working capital and net debt are not recognized measures under IFRS. Readers are cautioned that these specified financial measures should not be construed as alternatives to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. These specified financial measures provide additional information that management believes is meaningful in describing the Company's operational performance, liquidity and capacity to fund capital expenditures and other activities. Please see below for a brief overview of all specified financial measures used in this release and refer to the Company's MD&A for additional information relating to specified financial measures, which is available on the Company's website at www.southernenergycorp.com and filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\"\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n\" (non-IFRS financial measure) is calculated based on cash flow from operative activities before changes in non-cash working capital and cash decommissioning expenditures. Management uses adjusted funds flow from operations as a key measure to assess the ability of the Company to finance operating activities, capital expenditures and debt repayments.\n\"\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations per Share\n\" (non-IFRS financial measure) is calculated by dividing Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations by the number of Southern shares issued and outstanding.\n\"\nNet Debt\n\" (capital management measure) is monitored by management, along with adjusted working capital, as part of its capital structure in order to fund current operations and future growth of the Company. Net debt is defined as long-term debt plus adjusted working capital surplus or deficit. Adjusted working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities, removing current derivative assets/liabilities, the current portion of bank debt, the warrant liability, and the current portion of lease liabilities.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n[1]\nComprised of 23 bbl/d light and medium crude oil, 35 bbl/d of condensate, 0 bbl/d NGLs and 12,109 Mcf/d conventional natural gas\n[2]\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
