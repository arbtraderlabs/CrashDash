ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS\nCalgary, Alberta - November 18, 2025 - Southern Energy Corp.\n(\"\nSouthern\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (TSXV:SOU) (AIM:SOUC), an established producer with natural gas and light oil assets in Mississippi, announces its third quarter financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, which are available on the Company's website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nand have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2025 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u25cf\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $4.3 million during Q3 2025, an increase of 25% from the same period in 2024, largely due to the 50% increase in Q3 2025 natural gas pricing over Q3 2024\n\u25cf\nAverage production of 12,457\n[1]\nMcfe/d (2,076 boe/d) (97% natural gas) during Q3 2025, a decrease of 11% from the same period in 2024 and an increase of 10% from Q2 2025\n\u25cf\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q3 2025 of $3.59/Mcf and $63.53/bbl, compared to $2.40/Mcf and $73.78/bbl in Q3 2024. Southern achieved an average premium of $0.52/Mcf (approximately 17%) above the NYMEX HH benchmark in Q3 2025\n\u25cf\nGenerated $1.0 million of Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n[2]\nin Q3 2025 ($0.00 per share basic and diluted)\n\u25cf\nNet earnings of $0.5 million ($0.00 per share basic and diluted) in Q3 2025, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in Q3 2024\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\u25cf\nThe Company successfully completed an oil well in the Magee Field at the end of September 2025. The well produced approximately 3,000 bbl of oil in the month of October and is currently producing at steady rates ~ 85 bbl/d of oil. The final costs for the completion were $85,000, which resulted in a payout of less than three weeks on the project.\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern delivered another strong quarter, underpinned by a successful oil recompletion in the Magee Field and the continued strong performance of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well. These achievements have enhanced our cash flow and reaffirmed the depth and quality of our development inventory. With realized natural gas pricing averaging a 17% premium to Henry Hub during the quarter, our strategic positioning and disciplined execution continue to drive meaningful value for shareholders.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended September 30,\nNine months ended September 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 4,340\n$ 3,480\n$ 13,450\n$ 12,163\nNet income (loss)\n462\n(2,062)\n(3,828)\n(7,805)\nNet income (loss) per share\nBasic\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nFully diluted\n0.00\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n1,030\n552\n2,251\n3,484\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nFully diluted\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n340\n487\n2,808\n816\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nFully diluted\n336,255\n167,227\n276,353\n166,737\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n336,255\n167,243\n336,255\n167,243\nTotal assets\n50,626\n56,970\n50,626\n56,970\nNon-current liabilities\n19,826\n9,036\n19,826\n9,036\nNet debt (1)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\n$ (19,739)\n$ (22,710)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nOperations Update\nIn late June 2025, Southern brought online the first of its three remaining drilled but uncompleted (\"DUC\") horizontal wells from the Q1 2023 drilling program, and its first Lower Selma Chalk (\"LSC\") lateral - the GH LSC 13-13 #2 wellbore. Over the first 30 days of production the well averaged natural gas rates of 3.6 MMcfe/d (99% gas), which is an increase of over 100% compared to the average of the original LSC horizontal wells in Gwinville that were drilled and completed by the previous operators. The well has continued to flow throughout the quarter as per expectations, achieving an IP90 rate of 2.9 MMcfe/d.\nSouthern implemented stimulation design changes that improved the predictability and speed of the fracture operations, and most importantly, reduced the Company's overall expected completion cost for future horizontal wells down to ~ $1.8 million per well. Incorporating planned design changes on the drilling side, Southern now expects the full drill, complete, equip and tie-in cost for future Gwinville horizontal wells (5,000' lateral) to be ~ $4.0 million, which is 20% lower than the current capital estimates in the Company's third-party reserve report.\nSouthern will continue to monitor regional natural gas pricing over the upcoming months before making a decision on the completion timing of the remaining two DUC wells.\nSouthern continues to work with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") staff to resolve the ongoing transportation dispute that resulted in the shut-in of approximately 400 boe/d of production from the Mechanicsburg and Greens Creek fields. In September 2025, FERC requested certain data from the pipeline operator. Based on prescribed FERC resolution timelines and past rate determination processes, the Company now expects this issue to be resolved sometime in Q4 2025, at which point these production volumes will come back on-line. The ongoing US government shutdown has contributed to further unforeseen delays in the process.\nOutlook\nWith the recent operational success of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well completion and the Magee oil recompletion, Southern plans to leverage the resulting increase in cash flow to further strengthen its balance sheet and advance additional oil focused projects and the two remaining DUCs at Gwinville.\nThe Company continues to benefit from a fixed-price natural gas swap of 5,000 MMBtu/d at $3.40/MMBtu through December 2026, providing meaningful downside protection. Combined with improved regional pricing and a stronger financial position, Southern is well-positioned to execute a disciplined capital program focused on sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value creation.\nSouthern will continue to monitor NYMEX pricing and basis differentials and remains prepared to tactically hedge additional volumes as market conditions warrant. The Company appreciates the continued support of its stakeholders and looks forward to providing further updates as it advances its operational and financial objectives.\nQualified Person's Statement\nGary McMurren, Chief Operating Officer, who has over 24 years of relevant experience in the oil industry, has approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. McMurren is registered as a Professional Engineer with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering (with distinction) from the University of Alberta.\nFor further information about Southern, please visit our website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nor contact\n:\nSouthern Energy Corp.\nIan Atkinson (President and CEO)\n+1 587 287 5401\nCalvin Yau (CFO)\n+1 587 287 5402\nStrand Hanson Limited - Nominated & Financial Adviser\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Bellman\u00a0/ Rob Patrick / Edward Foulkes\nTennyson Securities - Broker\n+44 (0) 20 7186 9033\nPeter Krens / Jason Woollard\nAbout Southern Energy Corp.\nSouthern Energy Corp. is a natural gas exploration and production company characterized by a stable, low-decline production base, a significant low-risk drilling inventory and strategic access to premium commodity pricing in North America. Southern has a primary focus on acquiring and developing conventional natural gas and light oil resources in the southeast Gulf States of Mississippi, Louisiana, and East Texas. Our management team has a long and successful history working together and have created significant shareholder value through accretive acquisitions, optimization of existing oil and natural gas fields and the utilization of re-development strategies utilizing horizontal drilling and multi-staged fracture completion techniques.\nREADER ADVISORIES\nMCFE Disclosure\n. Natural gas liquids volumes are recorded in barrels of oil (bbl) and are converted to a thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) using a ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Natural gas volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet (Mcf) are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) using the ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Mcfe and boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf is based in an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf may be misleading as an indication of value.\nShort Term Results.\nReferences in this press release to peak rates, production rates since inception, current production rates, initial 30-day productions rates and other short-term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production of Southern. The Company cautions that such results should be considered to be preliminary.\nUnit Cost Calculation.\nFor the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas volumes have been converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet equal to one barrel unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms with NI 51-101. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\nProduct Types.\nThroughout this press release, \"crude oil\" or \"oil\" refers to light and medium crude oil product types as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"NGLs\" throughout this press release comprise pentane, butane, propane, and ethane, being all NGLs as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"natural gas\" throughout this press release refers to conventional natural gas as defined by NI 51-101.\nAbbreviations\n.

The forward-looking information contained in this press release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nFuture Oriented Financial Information\n. This press release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (collectively, \"\nFOFI\n\") about Southern's capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses, hedging, natural gas pricing and prospective results of operations and production, all of which are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in this document was approved by management as of the date of this document and was provided for the purpose of providing further information about Southern's future business operations. Southern and its management believe that FOFI has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting management's best estimates and judgments, and represent, to the best of management's knowledge and opinion, the Company's expected course of action. However, because this information is highly subjective, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results.

These specified financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Southern's method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations, adjusted working capital and net debt are not recognized measures under IFRS. Readers are cautioned that these specified financial measures should not be construed as alternatives to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. These specified financial measures provide additional information that management believes is meaningful in describing the Company's operational performance, liquidity and capacity to fund capital expenditures and other activities.

Management uses adjusted funds flow from operations as a key measure to assess the ability of the Company to finance operating activities, capital expenditures and debt repayments.\n\"\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations per Share\n\" (non-IFRS financial measure) is calculated by dividing Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations by the number of Southern shares issued and outstanding.\n\"\nNet Debt\n\" (capital management measure) is monitored by management, along with adjusted working capital, as part of its capital structure in order to fund current operations and future growth of the Company. Net debt is defined as long-term debt plus adjusted working capital surplus or deficit. Adjusted working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities, removing current derivative assets/liabilities, the current portion of bank debt, the warrant liability, and the current portion of lease liabilities.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n[1]\nComprised of 23 bbl/d light and medium crude oil, 35 bbl/d of condensate, 0 bbl/d NGLs and 12,109 Mcf/d conventional natural gas\n[2]\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Selected financial and operational information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis (the \"\nMD&A\n\") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, which are available on the Company's website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nand have been filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nAll figures referred to in this news release are denominated in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\nSECOND QUARTER 2025 HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and natural gas sales of $4.0 million during Q2 2025, an increase of 3% from the same period in 2024, largely due to the 61% increase in Q2 2025 natural gas pricing over Q2 2024\n\u00b7\nAverage production of 11,2951 Mcfe/d (1,883 boe/d) (96% natural gas) during Q2 2025, a decrease of 27% from the same period in 2024\n\u00b7\nIn June 2025, Southern successfully completed the second of its four high quality drilled uncompleted horizontal wells (\"\nDUCs\n\") from the Q1 2023 drilling program - the GH Lower Selma Chalk (\"\nLSC\n\") 13-13 #2 wellbore. The operation was completed safely and under budget\n\u00b7\nAverage realized natural gas and oil prices for Q2 2025 of $3.63/Mcf and $62.60/bbl, compared to $2.26/Mcf and $80.06/bbl in Q2 2024. Southern achieved an average premium of $0.19/Mcf (approximately 6%) above the NYMEX HH benchmark in Q2 2025\n\u00b7\nGenerated $0.6 million of Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations2 in Q2 2025 ($0.00 per share basic and diluted)\n\u00b7\nNet loss of $0.4 million ($0.00 per share basic and diluted) in Q2 2025, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in Q2 2024\n\u00b7\nOn April 8, 2025, Southern closed an equity financing raising aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 million (approximately \u00a33.9 million, C$7.2 million) through the issuance of a total of 102,482,673 new units\n(see \"\nShareholders' Equity - Share Capital\n\" in the June 30, 2025 MD&A for full details)\n\u00b7\nOn April 8, 2025, Southern converted the remaining convertible debentures in the amount of $3.1 million into 62,759,286 new units and issued 1,627,170\nnew units for all accrued and unpaid interest (see \"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - Debenture Financing\n\" in the June 30, 2025 MD&A for full details of the conversion)\n1\nComprised of 23 bbl/d light and medium crude oil, 43 bbl/d of condensate, 5 bbl/d NGLs and 10,869 Mcf/d conventional natural gas\n2\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\"\nIan Atkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, commented:\n\"Southern continued to build momentum through the second quarter of 2025, supported by firming natural gas prices and the successful completion in late June of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well in our Gwinville field, marking a key milestone in the redevelopment of our LSC inventory. Early flowback results are highly encouraging and we are particularly pleased to have completed this well at 10% below our original budget, accelerating expected payouts and reinforcing the economic viability of our broader development program.\nFollowing our $5.0 million financing in April, Southern resumed field operations with a focus on efficiency and value creation. The GH LSC 13-13 #2 well has already begun contributing significant new volumes with minimal incremental operating cost and benefited from an approximate 17% premium to Henry Hub pricing due to rising Southeast U.S. power demand during the start of summer. This premium underscores the strategic advantage of our geographic positioning and the strengthening macro backdrop.\nLooking ahead, we expect these new volumes to materially enhance our Q3 2025 cash flow profile. With a constructive outlook for natural gas pricing into the back half of 2025 and into 2026, combined with two additional high-quality DUCs, a deep inventory of drilling opportunities and ongoing capital discipline, Southern is well-positioned to deliver meaningful shareholder value through the remainder of the year and beyond.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended June 30,\nSix months ended June 30,\n(000s, except $ per share)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nPetroleum and natural gas sales\n$ 3,989\n$ 3,889\n$ 9,110\n$ 8,683\nNet loss\n(411)\n(2,622)\n(4,290)\n(5,743)\nNet loss per share\nBasic\n(0.00)\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\nFully diluted\n(0.00)\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\nAdjusted funds flow from operations (1)\n592\n770\n1,221\n2,932\nAdjusted funds flow from operations per share (1)\nBasic\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.02\nFully diluted\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.02\nCapital expenditures and acquisitions\n2,285\n60\n2,468\n329\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n321,585\n166,497\n291,452\n166,489\nFully diluted\n321,585\n166,497\n291,452\n166,489\nAs at period end\nCommon shares outstanding\n336,255\n166,497\n336,255\n166,497\nTotal assets\n53,333\n52,269\n53,333\n59,269\nNon-current liabilities\n21,040\n23,805\n21,040\n23,805\nNet debt (1)\n$ (19,784)\n$ (24,159)\n$ (19,784)\n$ (24,159)\nNote:\n(1)\nSee \"Reader Advisories - Specified Financial Measures\".\nOperations Update\nIn June 2025, Southern successfully completed the first of its three remaining DUC horizontal wells from the Q1 2023 drilling program, and its first LSC lateral - the GH LSC 13-13 #2 wellbore. Over the first 30 days of production the well averaged natural gas rates of 3.6 MMcfe/d (99% gas), which is an increase of over 100% compared to the average of the original LSC horizontal wells in Gwinville that were drilled and completed by the previous operators. The well has been flowing directly to Company facilities with all gas sold since June 26, 2025.\nSouthern safely and efficiently completed the horizontal lateral with 25 fracture stages, placing over 5.3 million lbs of proppant - a 70% increase in proppant intensity compared to the first-generation completions. The Company implemented targeted stimulation design changes that improved the predictability and speed of the fracture operations, and most importantly, reduced the overall completion cost to $2.2 million which is over 10% below pre-job estimates. Additionally, water flowback rates from the LSC reservoir have been over 70% less than Southern's Upper Selma Chalk horizontal wells, which translates into significant initial operating cost savings of ~ $0.20/Mcfe, further improving capital returns.\nSouthern will continue to monitor both regional natural gas pricing and well performance from the GH LSC 13-13 #2 over the upcoming months before making a decision on the completion timing of the remaining two DUC wells.\nSouthern continues to work with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"\nFERC\n\") staff to resolve the ongoing transportation dispute that resulted in the shut-in of approximately 400 boe/d of production from the Mechanicsburg and Greens Creek fields. Based on prescribed FERC resolution timelines, the Company expects the rate determination process to be resolved sometime in Q3 2025, at which point these production volumes will come back on-line.\nOutlook\nSouthern has taken meaningful steps to strengthen its financial position in 2025, including the successful $5.0 million equity financing in April 2025, conversion of convertible debentures, and restructuring of financial covenants with lender support. These actions, combined with the early success of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well and two additional DUCs in Gwinville, provide a clear runway for disciplined growth.\nThe Company also continues to benefit from a fixed-price swap of 5,000 MMBtu/d at $3.40/MMBtu through December 2026, offering downside protection. With improved regional pricing and a strengthened financial foundation, Southern is well-positioned to execute its capital program and generate long-term shareholder value.\nSouthern will continue to monitor NYMEX prices and the basis differential prices and is prepared to hedge additional volumes in a tactical manner going forward.\nWe appreciate the continued support of our stakeholders and look forward to providing further updates on our operational progress as we work to drive long-term shareholder value.\nQualified Person's Statement\nGary McMurren, Chief Operating Officer, who has over 24 years of relevant experience in the oil industry, has approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. McMurren is registered as a Professional Engineer with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering (with distinction) from the University of Alberta.\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders\nSouthern's Annual Meeting of Shareholders is to be held at the Company's offices located at Suite 2400, 333 - 7th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, T2P 2Z1, on Monday, October 27, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. (Calgary time) and by webcast via Zoom, formal notice of which is available on the Company's website and on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n.\nFor further information about Southern, please visit our website at\nwww.southernenergycorp.com\nor contact\n:\nSouthern Energy Corp.\nIan Atkinson (President and CEO)\n+1 587 287 5401\nCalvin Yau (CFO)\n+1 587 287 5402\nStrand Hanson Limited - Nominated & Financial Adviser\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nJames Bellman\u00a0/ Rob Patrick / Edward Foulkes\nTennyson Securities - Broker\n+44 (0) 20 7186 9033\nPeter Krens / Jason Woollard\nAbout Southern Energy Corp.\nSouthern Energy Corp. is a natural gas exploration and production company characterized by a stable, low-decline production base, a significant low-risk drilling inventory and strategic access to premium commodity pricing in North America.

Natural gas liquids volumes are recorded in barrels of oil (bbl) and are converted to a thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) using a ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Natural gas volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet (Mcf) are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) using the ratio of six (6) thousand cubic feet to one (1) barrel of oil (bbl). Mcfe and boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf is based in an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl or a Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl:6 Mcf may be misleading as an indication of value.\nShort Term Results.\nReferences in this press release to peak rates, production rates since inception, current production rates, initial 30-day productions rates and other short-term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production of Southern. The Company cautions that such results should be considered to be preliminary.\nUnit Cost Calculation.\nFor the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas volumes have been converted to a boe using six thousand cubic feet equal to one barrel unless otherwise stated. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms with NI 51-101. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\nProduct Types.\nThroughout this press release, \"crude oil\" or \"oil\" refers to light and medium crude oil product types as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"NGLs\" throughout this press release comprise pentane, butane, propane, and ethane, being all NGLs as defined by NI 51-101. References to \"natural gas\" throughout this press release refers to conventional natural gas as defined by NI 51-101.\nAbbreviations\n.

Certain information included in this press release constitutes forward-looking information under applicable securities legislation. Forward-looking information typically contains statements with words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"propose\", \"project\", \"continue\", \"evaluate\", \"forecast\", \"may\", \"will\", \"can\", \"target\" \"potential\", \"result\", \"could\", \"should\" or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook (including negatives and variations thereof). Forward-looking information in this press release may include, but is not limited to statements concerning the Company's asset base including the development of the Company's assets, positioning, oil and natural gas production levels, the Company's anticipated operational results, Southern's growth strategy and the expectation that it will continue to enhance shareholder value,\nSouthern's expectation that improved regional pricing and a strengthened financial foundation will support execution of its capital program and long-term value creation, forecasted natural gas pricing, Southern's ability to re-initiate growth in deploying the net proceeds from the equity financing on\ncapital expenditures, drilling and completion plans, expectations regarding commodity prices and service costs, expectations regarding the performance characteristics of the Company's oil and natural gas properties, the Company's hedging strategy and execution thereof (including\nits intention to continue monitoring commodity prices and basis differentials and to hedge additional volumes as deemed appropriate), the ability of the Company to achieve drilling success consistent with management's expectations,\nthe Company's expectations regarding completion of the two remaining DUCs and the drilling operations in the Mechanicsburg\nand Greens Creek fields\n(including the timing thereof and anticipated costs and funding\nas well as the evaluation of well performance and regional natural gas pricing to inform such decisions),\nthe Company's expectations regarding the resolution of regulatory disputes (including the anticipated timing thereof) and impact of FERC rate determinations on shut-in production volumes, the expected contribution of the GH LSC 13-13 #2 well to Q3 2025 cash flow, the Company's ability to realize sustained pricing premiums due to its strategic location in the Southeast U.S., the effect of market conditions on the Company's performance and expectations regarding the use of proceeds from all sources including the senior term loan. Statements relating to \"reserves\" and \"recovery\" are also deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Southern, including, but not limited to, the timing of and success of future drilling, development and completion activities, the performance of existing wells, the performance of new wells, the availability and performance of drilling rigs, facilities and pipelines, the geological characteristics of Southern's properties, the characteristics of the Company's assets, the Company's ability to comply with ongoing obligations under the senior term loan and other sources of financing, the successful application of drilling, completion and seismic technology, the benefits of current commodity pricing hedging arrangements, Southern's ability to enter into future derivative contracts on acceptable terms, Southern's ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, prevailing weather conditions, prevailing legislation, as well as regulatory and licensing requirements, affecting the oil and gas industry, the Company's ability to obtain all requisite permits and licences, prevailing commodity prices, price volatility, price differentials and the actual prices received for the Company's products, royalty regimes and exchange rates, the impact of inflation on costs,\nthe application of regulatory and licensing requirements, the Company's ability to obtain all requisite permits and licences, the availability of capital, labour and services, the creditworthiness of industry partners, the Company's ability to source and complete asset acquisitions, and the Company's ability to execute its plans and strategies.\nAlthough Southern believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Southern can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production, the uncertainty of reserve estimates, the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses, regulatory risks, and health, safety and environmental risks), constraint in the availability of labour, supplies, or services, the impact of pandemics, commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, geo-political risks, political and economic instability, the imposition or expansion of tariffs imposed by domestic and foreign governments or the imposition of other restrictive trade measures, retaliatory or countermeasures implemented by such governments, including the introduction of regulatory barriers to trade and the potential effect on the demand and/or market price for the Company's products and/or otherwise adversely affects the Company, wars (including the Russo-Ukrainian war and\nthe Israel-Hamas conflict\n), hostilities, civil insurrections, inflationary risks including potential increases to operating and capital costs, changes in legislation impacting the oil and gas industry, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties and environmental regulations (including greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements and other\u00a0decarbonization or social policies and including uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of omnibus Bill\u00a0C-59 and the related amendments to the Competition Act (Canada)), the Company's ability to meet its financial obligations and covenants, adverse weather or break-up conditions, and uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures. These and other risks are set out in more detail in Southern's latest Management Discussion and Analysis for the period ended June 30, 2025 and the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2024, which are available on the Company's website at www.southernenergycorp.com and filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nThe forward-looking information contained in this press release is made as of the date hereof and Southern undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws. The forward-looking information contained in this press release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nFuture Oriented Financial Information\n. This press release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (collectively, \"\nFOFI\n\") about Southern's capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses, hedging, natural gas pricing and prospective results of operations and production, all of which are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs. FOFI contained in this document was approved by management as of the date of this document and was provided for the purpose of providing further information about Southern's future business operations. Southern and its management believe that FOFI has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting management's best estimates and judgments, and represent, to the best of management's knowledge and opinion, the Company's expected course of action. However, because this information is highly subjective, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results. Southern disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any FOFI contained in this document, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required pursuant to applicable law. Readers are cautioned that the FOFI contained in this document should not be used for purposes other than for which it is disclosed herein. Changes in forecast commodity prices, differences in the timing of capital expenditures, and variances in average production estimates can have a significant impact on the key performance measures included in Southern's guidance. The Company's actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nSpecified Financial Measures.\nThis press release provides various financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (\"\nIFRS\n\"), including non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and capital management measures. These specified financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Southern's method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly, they may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations, adjusted working capital and net debt are not recognized measures under IFRS. Readers are cautioned that these specified financial measures should not be construed as alternatives to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. These specified financial measures provide additional information that management believes is meaningful in describing the Company's operational performance, liquidity and capacity to fund capital expenditures and other activities. Please see below for a brief overview of all specified financial measures used in this release and refer to the Company's MD&A for additional information relating to specified financial measures, which is available on the Company's website at www.southernenergycorp.com and filed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\"\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations\n\" (non-IFRS financial measure) is calculated based on cash flow from operative activities before changes in non-cash working capital and cash decommissioning expenditures. Management uses adjusted funds flow from operations as a key measure to assess the ability of the Company to finance operating activities, capital expenditures and debt repayments.\n\"\nAdjusted Funds Flow from Operations per Share\n\" (non-IFRS financial measure) is calculated by dividing Adjusted Funds Flow from Operations by the number of Southern shares issued and outstanding.\n\"\nNet Debt\n\" (capital management measure) is monitored by management, along with adjusted working capital, as part of its capital structure in order to fund current operations and future growth of the Company. Net debt is defined as long-term debt plus adjusted working capital surplus or deficit. Adjusted working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities, removing current derivative assets/liabilities, the current portion of bank debt, the warrant liability, and the current portion of lease liabilities.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
