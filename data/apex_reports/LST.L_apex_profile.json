Holdings PLC\n03 November 2025\nREACH: non-regulatory announcement*\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"\nLSTH\n\", \"\nLight Science\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nUK All Party Parliamentary Group Calls for Action on Food Production\nTechnology, innovation & smarter solutions required to ensure UK food security\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business providing real-world solutions targeting issues including global food security and fire safety, notes the release, and welcomes the recommendations, of the All Party Parliamentary Group, Science & Technology in Agriculture (\"APPGSTA\") report titled \"Feeding Britain Sustainably to 2050: the 30:50:50 mission\".\nThe APPGSTA encourages the UK Government to adopt a target of 30% greater agricultural output while halving the sector's environmental footprint by 2050. In doing so, it is recommended to develop a National Farm Data initiative, incentivise real-time data capture and AI-enabled decision-making tools, and perform a root-and-branch R&D review with a view to producing more food from less land, using less water and energy.\nThe report makes it clear that the US, EU, and OECD-FAO have already committed to driving innovation-led productivity growth and that the UK risks falling behind unless it embraces data-driven, technology-enabled agriculture, and creates strong policy momentum for business. In making its case, the APPGSTA notes that farming productivity growth has stalled due to fragmented support policies, over-precautionary regulation, and underuse of science. The result is a gap that must be closed between discovery science and farming practice.\nLSTH's AgTech division offers a suite of tailored agricultural solutions that encompass real time data control systems, grow lights, sensor technology, venting, and irrigation, alongside AI technology, directly enabling progress towards the report's headline objectives. Supporting applications in\nindoor, vertical, glasshouse, hybrid polytunnel, and broadacre farming, its products are designed to increase crop yield and health with less input and smarter intervention.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented:\n\"\nWe are extremely pleased to see that a number of the recommendations in today's report align with the messages that we have been championing. It has been clear to many in the industry for some time that we need a smarter, modern approach to the way we farm if we are to ensure we have the food we need, and it is absolutely right that the UK treats food security as a statutory national priority.\n\"We are proud of the pioneering work we have already been doing in this sector and believe that we have the solutions to provide customers with the tools to combat growing threats to food production both in the UK and globally. Regulatory pressure will continue to grow around the world and LSTH is well positioned to help growers meet emerging challenges and support Government in driving effective change.\"\nThe full report is available here:\nhttps://www.appg-agscience.org.uk/group-news\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\").

Holdings PLC\n29 September 2025\nREACH: non-regulatory announcement*\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nPFP Division Secures BSA Accreditation via Construction Online\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business, announces that its Passive Fire Protection (\"PFP\") division has achieved Building Safety Act 2022 (\"BSA\") Accreditation via Construction Online, a leading European platform for compliance and supply chain management in the construction sector.\nConstruction Online has only recently launched its BS 8670 accreditation process, designed to streamline supplier pre-qualification and help unblock delays across the construction supply chain. By completing this process, the Company's PFP division has demonstrated full competence in both Standard Construction and Higher Risk Buildings (over 18 metres), aligning with the requirements of BS 8670.\nAlready a holder of Gold Accreditation, the Company's additional certifications further validate its expertise across safety leadership, risk management, and fire/life protection, providing confidence to both the Building Safety Regulator and customers.\nStrong Growth Pipeline\nAs the UK's leading independent approved installer of Injectaclad, the PFP division has rapidly established itself since launching in November 2023. In that time, it has delivered work on 16 buildings, secured \u00a33.2 million in orders and built a quoted pipeline of approximately \u00a328 million. With active projects in Manchester, Southampton and Birmingham, the PFP division is well positioned to capitalise on rising demand as the Building Safety Regulator addresses the well-publicised industry backlogs.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of Light Science, commented:\n\"These accreditations reinforce our ability to deliver safe, compliant solutions for our customers. With Construction Online's new BSA accreditation streamlining the pre-qualification process, we are helping to speed up supply chain approvals and reduce delays across the industry. As the sector adapts to the new regulations, our PFP division is ready to move quickly, supporting contractors and unlocking projects. We believe that these accreditations will simplify processes for existing and potential customers and the PFP division is primed for rapid and sustained growth.\n\"As such, this recognition will support further contract wins and partnerships, cementing our position as a trusted leader in passive fire protection.\"\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\"). The company is involved in the design, manufacturing, and installation of products and customized solutions spanning various industry sectors, including commercial horticulture, pest control, lighting, audio, gas detection, and fire protection. With a focus on addressing global challenges related to food security, climate change, and fire protection, the Group is committed to developing robust solutions in these rapidly growing market sectors.\nLSTH is the holding company for LSTH IFB Limited (\"LSTH IFB\") in the PFP division; Light Science Technologies Ltd (\"Light Science Technologies\") and Tomtech (UK) Limited (\"Tomtech\") in the AGT division and UK Circuits and Electronics Solutions Limited (\"UK Circuits\") in the CEM division.\nPassive Fire Protection (\nhttps://injectafirebarrier.com/\n)\nLSTH IFB offers a practical and cost-effective solution to rectify non-compliant public and private buildings, spanning residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, with regard to fire safety regulations - a challenge addressed by a \u00a36.1 billion allocation from the UK government.
