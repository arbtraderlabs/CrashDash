Holdings PLC\n03 November 2025\nREACH: non-regulatory announcement*\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"\nLSTH\n\", \"\nLight Science\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nUK All Party Parliamentary Group Calls for Action on Food Production\nTechnology, innovation & smarter solutions required to ensure UK food security\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business providing real-world solutions targeting issues including global food security and fire safety, notes the release, and welcomes the recommendations, of the All Party Parliamentary Group, Science & Technology in Agriculture (\"APPGSTA\") report titled \"Feeding Britain Sustainably to 2050: the 30:50:50 mission\".\nThe APPGSTA encourages the UK Government to adopt a target of 30% greater agricultural output while halving the sector's environmental footprint by 2050. In doing so, it is recommended to develop a National Farm Data initiative, incentivise real-time data capture and AI-enabled decision-making tools, and perform a root-and-branch R&D review with a view to producing more food from less land, using less water and energy.\nThe report makes it clear that the US, EU, and OECD-FAO have already committed to driving innovation-led productivity growth and that the UK risks falling behind unless it embraces data-driven, technology-enabled agriculture, and creates strong policy momentum for business. In making its case, the APPGSTA notes that farming productivity growth has stalled due to fragmented support policies, over-precautionary regulation, and underuse of science. The result is a gap that must be closed between discovery science and farming practice.\nLSTH's AgTech division offers a suite of tailored agricultural solutions that encompass real time data control systems, grow lights, sensor technology, venting, and irrigation, alongside AI technology, directly enabling progress towards the report's headline objectives. Supporting applications in\nindoor, vertical, glasshouse, hybrid polytunnel, and broadacre farming, its products are designed to increase crop yield and health with less input and smarter intervention.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented:\n\"\nWe are extremely pleased to see that a number of the recommendations in today's report align with the messages that we have been championing. It has been clear to many in the industry for some time that we need a smarter, modern approach to the way we farm if we are to ensure we have the food we need, and it is absolutely right that the UK treats food security as a statutory national priority.\n\"We are proud of the pioneering work we have already been doing in this sector and believe that we have the solutions to provide customers with the tools to combat growing threats to food production both in the UK and globally. Regulatory pressure will continue to grow around the world and LSTH is well positioned to help growers meet emerging challenges and support Government in driving effective change.\"\nThe full report is available here:\nhttps://www.appg-agscience.org.uk/group-news\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\").

Holdings PLC\n03 November 2025\nREACH: non-regulatory announcement*\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"\nLSTH\n\", \"\nLight Science\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nUK All Party Parliamentary Group Calls for Action on Food Production\nTechnology, innovation & smarter solutions required to ensure UK food security\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business providing real-world solutions targeting issues including global food security and fire safety, notes the release, and welcomes the recommendations, of the All Party Parliamentary Group, Science & Technology in Agriculture (\"APPGSTA\") report titled \"Feeding Britain Sustainably to 2050: the 30:50:50 mission\".\nThe APPGSTA encourages the UK Government to adopt a target of 30% greater agricultural output while halving the sector's environmental footprint by 2050. In doing so, it is recommended to develop a National Farm Data initiative, incentivise real-time data capture and AI-enabled decision-making tools, and perform a root-and-branch R&D review with a view to producing more food from less land, using less water and energy.\nThe report makes it clear that the US, EU, and OECD-FAO have already committed to driving innovation-led productivity growth and that the UK risks falling behind unless it embraces data-driven, technology-enabled agriculture, and creates strong policy momentum for business. In making its case, the APPGSTA notes that farming productivity growth has stalled due to fragmented support policies, over-precautionary regulation, and underuse of science. The result is a gap that must be closed between discovery science and farming practice.\nLSTH's AgTech division offers a suite of tailored agricultural solutions that encompass real time data control systems, grow lights, sensor technology, venting, and irrigation, alongside AI technology, directly enabling progress towards the report's headline objectives. Supporting applications in\nindoor, vertical, glasshouse, hybrid polytunnel, and broadacre farming, its products are designed to increase crop yield and health with less input and smarter intervention.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented:\n\"\nWe are extremely pleased to see that a number of the recommendations in today's report align with the messages that we have been championing. It has been clear to many in the industry for some time that we need a smarter, modern approach to the way we farm if we are to ensure we have the food we need, and it is absolutely right that the UK treats food security as a statutory national priority.\n\"We are proud of the pioneering work we have already been doing in this sector and believe that we have the solutions to provide customers with the tools to combat growing threats to food production both in the UK and globally. Regulatory pressure will continue to grow around the world and LSTH is well positioned to help growers meet emerging challenges and support Government in driving effective change.\"\nThe full report is available here:\nhttps://www.appg-agscience.org.uk/group-news\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\").

Additionally, an order from Haygrove Limited, a global grower of berries and cherries, and supplier of field-scale polytunnels and associated technologies to growers in more than 50 countries, will result in the delivery of the SensorGROW platform into Australia, New Zealand, Jordan, Poland and the USA. The Company is also set to have its climate computers installed in a greenhouse in Bhutan.\nGrowing product suite\nThe Company continues to develop innovative environmental sensor solutions that will further enhance positive client outcomes. For example, in a recent trial with Dyson evaluating Life Cycle Assessment in peas, SensorGROW was utilised to measure nitrous oxide, demonstrating how the gas can inhibit crop growth triggered by inefficient use of fertilisers. The Board considers that there are still numerous market opportunities available through developing the Company's sensor technology further, with key potential developments including methane, ammonia and water course measurement.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of Light Science, commented:\n\"We are delighted with the increased recognition and opportunity globally and are in concrete talks regarding a number of exciting, and importantly, sizeable contracts. We see distribution agreements as key to our low-risk, low cost growth strategy as we target a growing, global audience, with increasingly strong demand for global food security and sustainable growing solutions underpinning our confidence in converting the AgTech pipeline, which currently stands at approximately \u00a345 million.

By completing this process, the Company's PFP division has demonstrated full competence in both Standard Construction and Higher Risk Buildings (over 18 metres), aligning with the requirements of BS 8670.\nAlready a holder of Gold Accreditation, the Company's additional certifications further validate its expertise across safety leadership, risk management, and fire/life protection, providing confidence to both the Building Safety Regulator and customers.\nStrong Growth Pipeline\nAs the UK's leading independent approved installer of Injectaclad, the PFP division has rapidly established itself since launching in November 2023. In that time, it has delivered work on 16 buildings, secured \u00a33.2 million in orders and built a quoted pipeline of approximately \u00a328 million. With active projects in Manchester, Southampton and Birmingham, the PFP division is well positioned to capitalise on rising demand as the Building Safety Regulator addresses the well-publicised industry backlogs.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of Light Science, commented:\n\"These accreditations reinforce our ability to deliver safe, compliant solutions for our customers. With Construction Online's new BSA accreditation streamlining the pre-qualification process, we are helping to speed up supply chain approvals and reduce delays across the industry. As the sector adapts to the new regulations, our PFP division is ready to move quickly, supporting contractors and unlocking projects. We believe that these accreditations will simplify processes for existing and potential customers and the PFP division is primed for rapid and sustained growth.\n\"As such, this recognition will support further contract wins and partnerships, cementing our position as a trusted leader in passive fire protection.\"\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\").

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nContract Wins\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business providing real-world solutions targeting issues including global food security and fire safety, announces that it has signed two contracts with two new clients in its Passive Fire Protection (\"PFP\") division, which together are worth c.\u00a30.45m.\nThe contracts relate to two projects, in Manchester and Birmingham respectively, and address the remediation of a hotel operated by a prominent multinational chain, and a school building for a leading UK construction company. Importantly, there is significant potential to increase the scope of both of the relationships with a large number of additional buildings within the respective new clients' portfolios.\nThe contracts, which will be completed in H2 2025, further demonstrate the scale of the legislation-backed opportunity - with the Company providing a cost-effective and minimally disruptive solution. This requirement is immediate, substantive and growing, and Government has been particularly vocal about its commitment to clearing the remediation backlog. The Company continues to benefit from growing demand from both existing and new customers.\nReforms to Building Safety Regulation to accelerate house building and remediation\nThe recent creation of an arm's length body under the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, taking on functions of the Building Safety Regulator, is expected to result in a fast-track process for new builds and remediation. Once implemented, the Board believes that there will be further opportunities to scale operations.\nThe Company is in active talks with a number of potential and existing customers, and the Board is confident of securing new contracts in the near-term. Importantly, it is seeing growing demand for larger projects, which is expected to further increase the contribution from the PFP division.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH commented\n:\n\"We are delighted by the improving momentum in the PFP division, seeing further conversion of the c.\u00a324 million quoted pipeline. Despite broader market issues causing some contract delays, specifically the long timescales taken by\nthe Building Safety Regulator to sign off fire safety in tall buildings, and the UK Government responding by making structural changes to the regulator itself\n, we are now seeing this bottleneck starting to unblock and are confident that pipeline conversion will rapidly grow. Encouragingly, we are already seeing initial follow-on activity with one customer.\nThis is a legislation-backed opportunity and our solution is already proven, with a growing number of existing and new clients wanting to rectify non-compliant public and private buildings, spanning residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.\"\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\n\u200b\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\").

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nCEM Contract Wins worth approximately \u00a30.5m\nUK Transport Contract for New Customer & Follow-on Orders\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business providing real-world solutions targeting issues including global food security and fire safety, announces\nthat its Contract Electronics Manufacturing division (\"CEM\"), UK Circuits and Electronics Solutions Limited (\"UKC\"), has won three contracts worth, in aggregate, approximately \u00a30.5m (comprising a new contract worth approximately \u00a30.3m and two re-tendered contracts with existing clients worth a further approximately \u00a30.2m).\nThe first contract is for a new client based in Sweden, which specialises in electronic signage for the transport sector, providing upgraded lighting circuitry for use on a major UK transport network. Valued at approximately \u00a30.3m, monthly deliveries are expected to start in October 2025 and continue over the course of the next financial year, and this opportunity has the potential to generate follow-on revenue.\nThe CEM division has also received a further two successfully re-tendered contacts from existing clients, worth in addition, approximately \u00a30.2m. Deliveries of these two contracts will also commence in the Company's current financial year, with the two new orders expected to be fulfilled by the end of October 2026.\nThe total value of the CEM forward order book now stands in excess of \u00a32.5m.\nUKC continues to supply products to a growing number of customers across an increasingly broad range of market sectors, targeting larger contracts which provide better financial visibility. The focus is on targeting higher-margin sectors thereby reducing exposure to individual markets and clients, with increased investment, automation and accreditations positioning CEM for increasingly profitable growth. These contracts demonstrate an increasingly robust conversion of the Group's strong quoted pipeline, which, as announced in the Company's unaudited interim results for the 6 months ended 31 May 2025, released on 12 August 2025, currently stands at over \u00a358m across its three divisions.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to share the positive progress in our CEM division with a new client win and two follow-on contract wins. We are highly focused on converting our quoted pipeline and are continuing to progressively re-position the CEM division into key growth markets which include transport, defence and the medical sectors.\n\"In particular, we are excited to be providing turnkey solutions for this prestigious new customer based in Sweden, also demonstrating the potential for further international growth and further de-risking the CEM division as we continue to diversify.\"\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\").

The company is involved in the design, manufacturing, and installation of products and customized solutions spanning various industry sectors, including commercial horticulture, pest control, lighting, audio, gas detection, and fire protection. With a focus on addressing global challenges related to food security, climate change, and fire protection, the Group is committed to developing robust solutions in these rapidly growing market sectors.\nLSTH is the holding company for LSTH IFB Limited (\"LSTH IFB\") in the PFP division; Light Science Technologies Ltd (\"Light Science Technologies\") and Tomtech (UK) Limited (\"Tomtech\") in the AGT division and UK Circuits and Electronics Solutions Limited (\"UK Circuits\") in the CEM division.\nPassive Fire Protection (\nhttps://injectafirebarrier.com/\n)\nLSTH IFB offers a practical and cost-effective solution to rectify non-compliant public and private buildings, spanning residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, with regard to fire safety regulations - a challenge addressed by a \u00a36.1 billion allocation from the UK government. Serving as the UK's premier independent approved installer, LSTH IFB utilises the ground-breaking Injectaclad fire-resistant graphite barrier system. This system is retroactively installed within building cavities, reinstating fire-resistant performance and containing the spread of fire and smoke compliant with regulatory requirements. This innovative solution stands out as an appealing alternative to the more costly and disruptive method of removing external facades and installing traditional fire barriers. With a proven track record in the passive fire protection market and a robust sales pipeline, LSTH IFB targets a UK market potentially valued at up to \u00a350 billion*.\nAgTech\nThe Group's tailored solutions encompass control systems, grow lights, sensor technology, venting, and irrigation systems, catering to both UK and global customers. Key markets include indoor, vertical, glasshouses, polytunnels, and more recently wider applications in broadacre farming. Driving factors comprise global food and water shortages, a growing population, government policies promoting sustainable growth methods, heightened scrutiny of food production's impact on climate change, and a shift away from processed foods. Key markets span the Americas, Australasia, and select locations in the Middle East.\nThe sensorGROW technology enables real-time monitoring of essential air zone growing factors such as carbon dioxide, air humidity, air pressure, air temperature and light, in addition to essential root zone cardinals such as soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil electroconductivity. Further developments to monitor greenhouse gases, initially Nitrous Oxide (N20) are in progress. This empowers farmers to enhance resource management, sav",

The proven quality and longevity of Injectaclad provides further validation for building owners, residents, fire engineers, and regulators alike, with the Company primed to benefit from increased leverage as the UK's first independent approved installer of the system.\nThe rigorous testing,\nconducted to ASTM F1980 standards1\n, adds further value to the Injectaclad solution, and provides an additional USP - with the market looking for proven, cost effective and minimally invasive solutions to rectify non-compliant public and private buildings in the UK requiring cavity remediation. As regulations tighten and expectations rise, Injectaclad continues to set the standard for high-performance cavity fire barriers.\nChris Lewis, CEO of Injectaclad, commented:\n\"This test further validates the robust performance of the Injectaclad solution over time. When lives depend on fire safety systems functioning decades from installation, this kind of data is non-negotiable. We're proud to deliver a product you can trust today, tomorrow, and 50 years from now. We recently awarded LSTH the Injectaclad Contractor Award and look forward to continuing our relationship with them.\"\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented:\n\"It's fantastic to have this additional qualification. We are focused on providing a cost effective and compelling solution to the regulatory-backed industry. Government targets will need to be fulfilled and we believe that the strength of our pipeline and ability to deliver increasingly large contracts to existing and new clients highlight the scalability and potential of this division.\nAs the UK's premier independent approved installer, there is significant potential for us to add to our Injectaclad pump fleet and take advantage of the growing fire safety retrofit market in the UK.\"\n1\nF1980 Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Barrier Systems and Medical Devices\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nvia Walbrook PR\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTom Griffiths / George Payne\n+44 (0)20 7408 4050\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: Passive fire protection (\"PFP\"); AgTech (\"AGT\") and contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\").

Holdings PLC\n24 March 2025\nREACH\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nPFP Division - UK \"Remediation of Dangerous Cladding\" Report\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business providing real-world solutions targeting issues including global food security and fire safety, notes the UK Committee of Public Accounts report on the remediation of dangerous cladding, published on Friday 21 March 2025, and reiterates its belief that the Injectaclad solution installed by LSTH IFB Ltd (Injecta Fire Barrier),\noffers the most practical, cost-effective and least invasive solution to rectifying non-compliant public and private buildings in the UK, requiring cavity remediation.\nThe report highlights severe delays, with work yet to start on half of identified buildings, increasing financial burdens on residents, a lack of skilled engineers, and a large increase in the expected scope of works. Initially estimated as a \u00a3600 million effort for 450 buildings, estimates have expanded to cover 9,000-12,000 medium and high-rise buildings, with projected costs between \u00a312.6 billion and \u00a322.4 billion.\nThe Injectaclad solution offers several key benefits to alternative methods, which typically require the removal of an entire brick or rendered fa\u00e7ade, and addresses many of the difficulties highlighted in the report whilst facilitating lower risk mitigations under the PAS 9980 guidance for risk-based assessments of external walls. Firstly, it is a far more cost-effective solution with a typical project quote being c.3x lower than the alternative of fa\u00e7ade removal. Installation is within the internal cavity so reduces disruption for residents and overall project length significantly, while capacity is fast to ramp up, with a large pool of UK fire safety accredited installers available.\nSince it was acquired in November 2023, Injecta Fire Barrier has worked on 11 buildings, taken orders totalling \u00a32.7million, and has built a quoted pipeline of live projects with a combined value of \u00a316.5 million. This should see the conversion of the strong quoted pipeline at a faster rate now the Building Safety Regulator has committed to clearing a backlog on 122 Gateway 2 projects by the end of April 2025.\nThe \"Remediation of Dangerous Cladding\" report can be downloaded by following the link below. This is a House of Commons committee report, which makes recommendations to the UK government. The Government has two months to respond.\nhttps://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5901/cmselect/cmpubacc/362/report.html\nCommenting on the report, Simon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer of LSTH, said:\n\"This report clearly highlights the slow progress on vital remediation work in the UK. In addition to that, public consensus is that the 2029 target for completing works is an unacceptably long time for this work to go undone. A stark reminder of this danger came only last August with the Dagenham fire.\n\"We have a compelling solution that meets new safety standards, saves money, is far faster to implement, causes significantly less disruption, and is quick to scale. Wider adoption of Injectaclad ultimately means that homes and places of work will be safer; both at a faster rate and with less financial burden.\"\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nvia Walbrook PR\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / James Harris / Rob Patrick\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital (Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\nTel: +44 (0) 203 179 5300\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: AgTech (\"AGT\"); contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\"); and passive fire protection (\"PFP\").

The company is involved in the design, manufacturing, and installation of products and customized solutions spanning various industry sectors, including commercial horticulture, pest control, lighting, audio, gas detection, and fire protection. With a focus on addressing global challenges related to food security, climate change, and fire protection, the Group is committed to developing robust solutions in these rapidly growing market sectors.\nLSTH is the holding company for Light Science Technologies Ltd (\"Light Science Technologies\") and Tomtech (UK) Limited (\"Tomtech\") in the AGT division; UK Circuits and Electronics Solutions Limited (\"UK Circuits\") in the CEM division; and LSTH IFB Limited (\"LSTH IFB\") in the PFP division.\nAgTech\nThe Group's tailored solutions encompass control systems, grow lights, sensor technology, venting, and irrigation systems, catering to both UK and global customers. Key markets include indoor, vertical, glasshouses, polytunnels, and more recently wider applications in broadacre farming.

Holdings PLC\n26 February 2025\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nCapital Markets Day and Retail Investor Presentation\nGrowth opportunities and margin improvement across all divisions\nPositioned to build upon H2 net profitability\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), the innovative technology and manufacturing business providing real-world solutions targeting issues including global food security and fire safety, is, as previously announced, hosting its Capital Markets Day for analysts and institutional investors this morning.\nBuilding on record Group revenue and gross profit margin for the 12 month period ending 30 November 2024 (unaudited), with increasing quoted pipelines across all divisions worth c.\u00a350m, the Group traded profitably during H2. Management will talk to the changing divisional mix and key growth drivers. This will include deep-dives into the various business segments and product portfolio, highlighting the continued focus on organic and acquisitive growth with the Group targeting net profitability and being operationally self-funded.\nThe slide deck from the event, which contains no new material information, will be uploaded to the Company's website\u00a0later today.\nContinued growth across the Group\nThe Group continues to perform in line with management expectations, and with a growing pipeline underpinning management's confidence.\nWith a growing product suite, incorporating turnkey solutions, software and the development of a full environmental sensor, which enables the Group to provide bespoke solutions to an increasing number of potential end users including broadacre, the Group is renaming its controlled environment agriculture division (\"CEA\") to AgTech (\"AGT\"), to better reflect the breadth of its capabilities.\nThis division continues to provide significant growth opportunities, with a quoted pipeline worth over \u00a340m - significantly boosted by the recently announced partnership with Agrolux. To this end it is commencing a trial in March for a fruit crop which could lead to an order covering over three hectares of lighting, with further projects expected in the near to medium term.\nThe forward order book within the Contract Electronics Manufacturing (\"CEM\") division is currently worth over \u00a32.7m, with sports entertainment in particular growing at pace. The Group has also recently been awarded 'Made in Britain' accreditation, which management believes will help drive further demand, with increasing levels of onshoring back to the UK.\nThe Passive Fire Protection (\"PFP\") quoted pipeline has grown to c.\u00a315m. As previously highlighted, this high margin growth is underpinned by legislative backing, with the Group benefiting from growing levels of repeat work from existing clients. Additionally, this division continues to receive orders from new clients, with recent projects wins including one in Wakefield and one in Greenwich.\nImportantly, there is a significant need for targeted, cost effective and scalable solutions, with 11,000 buildings over 18m high and 33,000 buildings between 11m and 18m high requiring remediation works, underpinning a \u00a350 billion* total estimated market opportunity.\nPlatform for growth\nThe continuing trends of increasing levels of order book conversion and growing contributions from AGT and PFP divisions are underpinning enhanced Group margin growth, which is expected to be maintained as the rebalancing of the portfolio and sales mix continues. With AGT and PFP divisional gross margins of 40-50% - approximately double those that are typically achieved within CEM, the Group is well positioned to benefit from scaling of revenues in these divisions as it focuses on building on profitable trading during H2 2024.\nRetail Investor Presentation\nAs previously announced, management will be providing a recording of the Capital Markets Day on the LSTH website following the event and investors are invited to watch this in their own time.\nThe Company will host a retail investor Q&A session to discuss the Capital Markets Day via the Investor Meet Company (\"IMC\") platform. This will take place in March, with the date to coincide with the announcement of audited results for the year ended 30 November 2024.\nInvestors can sign up to IMC for free and register to meet the Company via the following link:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/light-science-technologies-holdings-plc/register-investor\nThose investors who have already registered on the IMC platform to meet the Company will automatically be invited once the timing of the event has been finalised.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH commented:\n\"I am delighted with the continued progress across the business. Since joining the market three years ago we have worked hard to position the Group for strong organic and acquisitive growth. We are well positioned across exciting growth markets and have a team in place to bui",

Gross margins grew to c.28.0% (2023: 23.4%), with losses for the Period reducing substantially to c.\u00a30.2m (2023: \u00a31.1m loss). Group cash at the end of the Period was an improved c.\u00a31.2m (H1 2024: \u00a31.1m) with additional undrawn funds availability of c.\u00a30.7m (H1 2024: \u00a30.5m) under debt facilities with Close Brothers. Importantly, the business was net profitable during H2 2024, and management is expecting to sustain this momentum in FY 2025.\nIncreasing levels of order book conversion and, as expected, growing contributions from CEA and PFP ensured positive movement across all of the Company's key trading metrics.\nOperational Highlights\nRevenues from the CEM division grew by approximately 5% to c.\u00a39.5m with continued strong traction from sports entertainment, highlighting the benefits of the Company's investment in this division. CEM is positioned to benefit from increased automation and positioning to handle larger volume projects, which will help to further drive margin growth.\nThe CEA division generated revenues of c.\u00a30.8m - up approximately 250% year-on-year, further building on half-year revenues of c.\u00a30.4m - highlighting increased traction and the benefits of the Tomtech acquisition, which is helping drive increased cross selling opportunities. Additionally, distribution agreements are enabling low cost and low risk entry into expected high growth markets globally. As the sector advances, the Company anticipates that its sensor technologies will become relevant across a significantly broader range of markets. Beyond its current applications in Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and broadacre farming, the Company sees potential for its technologies to address critical needs in environmental monitoring, fire protection, water management, and more. This expansion would allow the Company to serve a diverse array of industries, enhancing its reach and impact.\nThe PFP division contributed c.\u00a31.8m in sales, establishing an entirely new revenue stream for the Group, which has grown rapidly, having generated revenues of c.\u00a30.3m during H1. This division is already seeing strong demand through repeat orders and follow-on contracts from existing customers, which supports higher visibility of future revenue. With growth supported by legislative backing and the recent investment in new machinery, PFP is well-positioned to leverage its momentum and enhance the Group's near-term cash generation.\nOutlook\nAs previously highlighted, the Company is well positioned to generate increasing levels of revenue from the CEA and PFP divisions, building on the strong progress achieved during the Period. This is expected to further enhance Group margins and is part of the previously highlighted rebalancing of the portfolio and sales mix.\nWith increased visibility across PFP and CEA and a strong and growing quoted pipeline - valued at over \u00a350m, the focus remains on increased levels of conversion, as the Group trends towards profitability.\nImportantly, the increased margin and revenue growth opportunity afforded by CEA and PFP will help offset a potential reduction in revenues within the CEM division during the next financial year, given current uncertainty on timing of the Company's largest customer within the pest control market bringing one of its product lines to end of life. As management continues to rebalance the business and cost base, the combination of growth outside of the pest control market within the CEM division with further strong contributions from PFP and CEA and improving margins, is expected to offset the effect of any potential revenue reduction.\nAs such, management is confident that the business remains well placed to achieve continued grow",

As with other clients within the PFP division, there is scope to generate additional revenues from this customer's portfolio of sites throughout the UK.\nThe Company has also recently completed another PFP project at an office block in the Strand, London, worth c. \u00a325,000. The division is currently working on projects in Nottingham, Manchester and Liverpool, and the PFP division has a current quoted pipeline worth in excess of \u00a37 million.\nThe PFP division is focussed on strengthening relationships with its customers, who typically are responsible for portfolios of properties requiring remedial work in respect of fire safety. With the recently expanded capacity, the Company also continues to target new projects with new clients across the UK.\nFurthermore, demand for remedial passive fire protection solutions is being driven by the Fire Safety Act 2021 and Building Safety Act 2022. Given the ongoing UK Government focus on developers, building owners, housing associations etc., undertaking remediation works continues to underpin the market, with\nover 5,000 high risk buildings nationwide over 18 metres high and a further 35,000 buildings between 11 and 18 metres* requiring urgent attention.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented:\n\"We continue to see strong demand within the PFP division. Our cost effective and non-invasive retrospective installation of cavity fire barriers will help meet Government targets in bringing buildings up to the required fire safety standards, giving building owners and their occupants peace of mind. Recent installations into office blocks, student accommodation and now the research facility in Liverpool have ranged significantly in sizes (\nbetween 6 and 18 metres plus in height\n), highlighting the flexibility of our solutions as we focus on tackling the significant need to ensure fire security measures are met\n.\n\"With 1,300 buildings in London alone needing priority remedial fire safety work**, we have an excellent opportunity to establish ourselves, and Injectaclad, as the preferred answer.\n\"As with everyone in this industry, the Company followed the findings of the Grenfell Report closely and would embrace any proposed regulatory changes. We look forward to the Government's response in due course and will fully support any legislation that is implemented.\"\n*\nEstimators price cladding replacement at 10 times government budget (theconstructionindex.co.uk)\n**\nLondon Fire Brigade calls for refit of all high-rise buildings - BBC News\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nvia Walbrook PR\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / James Harris / Rob Patrick\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital (Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\nTel: +44 (0) 203 179 5300\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: controlled environment agriculture (\"CEA\"); contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\"); and passive fire protection (\"PFP\").

Holdings PLC\n20 August 2024\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nStrong trading in Contract Electronics Manufacturing Division\nThird Sports Entertainment Order\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), comprising three divisions: Controlled Environment Agriculture (\"CEA\"); Contract Electronics Manufacturing (\"CEM\"); and Passive Fire Protection (\"PFP\"), announces that its CEM Division has received a third order from its customer in the sports entertainment segment, worth \u00a3134,000.\nSince its first order in the sports entertainment segment was announced in February 2024, Light Science has now received orders for a total of 15,000 units, worth in excess of \u00a3400,000 in revenue. The order will be completed within the current financial year. The customer currently has 14 entertainment venues in the US, four venues in the UK, and is rapidly expanding with eight new venues currently under construction in the US.\nThe Board has previously highlighted the opportunity within this sector, and believes that there is significant scope for continued growth. The Company anticipates the potential for regular new orders not only when new entertainment venues are opened, but also to replace units when lost, damaged, or having reached the end of their life cycle; which could provide the CEM division with a highly visible recurring revenue stream.\nApplication of similar compact sensor circuit technology could have potential for use in other sports markets.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH, commented:\n\"I'm delighted with the continued momentum within the CEM Division and the Group as a whole. Importantly, we are establishing long-term relationships with global clients that have the ability to underpin repeat business opportunities, which we believe will result in increased visibility as we continue to convert our strong quoted sales pipeline.\n\"The Group has really turned a corner this year in all market sectors, and we're seeing many of the changes we've made begin to yield positive results. In CEM specifically, we've invested strategically in our ability to take on larger and more significant contracts, which allows us to capitalise on the post-Covid move away from Far East manufacturing.\n\"We are excited to play a part in our customer's expansion as they bring new and innovative solutions to market and we look forward to sharing further progress in the future.\"\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nvia Walbrook PR\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / James Harris / Rob Patrick\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital (Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\nTel: +44 (0) 203 179 5300\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: controlled environment agriculture (\"CEA\"); contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\"); and passive fire protection (\"PFP\").

Holdings PLC\n22 July 2024\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU) 596 / 2014 WHICH FORMS PART OF UNITED KINGDOM LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED. UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\"LSTH\", \"Light Science\", the \"Company\" or the\u00a0\"Group\")\nContract Electronics Manufacturing Division Update\nRecord Breaking Year expected in Pest Control Market\nBusiness Wins in new segment\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc (AIM: LST), comprising three divisions: controlled environment agriculture (\"CEA\"); contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\") and passive fire protection (\"PFP\"), announces continued strong momentum at its CEM division - underpinned by an expected record breaking year for the CEM division in the pest control market.\nCurrent year pest control market anticipated revenues ahead of FY 23\nLast week the Company added \u00a3628,000 in committed forward orders within its CEM division, which are in addition to historical forward order profiles. As a result, pest control revenues already booked and committed forward orders received and to be satisfied in the current financial year are \u00a3825,000 (or 15%) higher than total revenues received from this segment during FY 23.\nStrong trading in new CEM segment\nThe CEM division has received a follow-on order from the Company's client in the sports entertainment segment worth \u00a3130,000. When this contract was initially announced in February 2024, the Company highlighted the significant potential for follow-on revenue, and this order signals the next phase of roll out.\nThis division continues to benefit from\u00a0recent positioning to handle larger volume projects and take advantage of wider market trends and the move away from Far East manufacturing.\nOverall, the Company anticipates reporting full year revenues for the CEM segment of between \u00a39m to \u00a39.5m. Trading in the Company's other two divisions remains in line with management expectations and as reported on 04 July 2024.\nSimon Deacon, CEO of LSTH commented:\n\"I'm delighted with the continued momentum within the CEM Division. Importantly we are establishing long-term relationships with clients that have the ability to underpin repeat business opportunities, which will result in increased visibility as we convert our strong quoted sales pipeline. We are excited by the significant opportunity within our existing and potential customer base and look forward to providing further updates in due course.\"\nFor additional information please contact:\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\nSimon Deacon, Chief Executive Officer\nJim Snooks, Chief Financial Officer\nAndrew Hempsall, Chief Operating Officer\nvia Walbrook PR\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / James Harris / Rob Patrick\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital (Broker)\nMike Seabrook / Nick Lovering\nTel: +44 (0) 203 179 5300\nWalbrook PR Ltd (Media & Investor Relations)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nlst@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome / Joe Walker\nNotes to Editors\n:\nAbout Light Science Technologies Holdings plc\n(\nwww.lightsciencetechnologiesholdings.com\n)\nLight Science Technologies Holdings plc operates through three divisions: controlled environment agriculture (\"CEA\"); contract electronics manufacturing (\"CEM\"); and passive fire protection (\"PFP\").

Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony. Solid British innovation that should be being rewarded with more onshore investors. Time the bigger instos took a look.",

AGT revenues grew to \u00a30.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.4m), with average gross margins of 42.0% (H1 2024: 48.4%) and CEM generated revenues of \u00a33.6m (H1 2024: \u00a34.5m). Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors. That is being fully addressed with multiple engagements focussed on the desire of UK industries to increasingly onshore, particularly in defence. Margins in the other two businesses are excellent so progress should be swift. Good time to board the train imo if not already invested and increasing.",

Given the size and backlog of projects in all three divisions it is only a matter of time before the staircase moves again. The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight.

The upside is that virtually all stale holders will now have exited and we have a raft of new investors here at prices in excess of today. Fundamentals are all sound and in place with competent and seasoned (and deeply invested) management in place. Lots of potential news triggers to relight interest here and it's a superb target for 2026 investment comment in the run up to Christmas and New Year. I can see this easily doubling to a \u00a330m MCap and above in 2026 given potential and quoted order pipeline. Injectaclad is the elephant in the room as urgency to rectify cladding issues intensifies and unlocks that side of the business book. AgTech has the ability to surprise and CEM has been courting the defence sector. Definitely not a share to be out of over the festive period. Got to be in it to benefit from the raft of RNS that could fall on the desk at any time. Given the regular and informative RNS stream, one looks imminent.",

Unless there were a lot of unannounced smaller contracts I think Fire revenue in H2 2025 could be substantially lower then the \u00a31.5m in H2 2024.

A lot has happened since then and that division has secured new contracts whilst also purposefully engaging with and targetting the defence sector (Nov RNS). The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation. This is an excellent UK small cap deserving of a rating which reflects it's pipeline, management and skillset.",

The issue of cladding remediation is top of the government list of building priorities to allow safety, reinsurance and mortgage lending on affected properties. Major real estate holders are working with LST and it would appear that funding liquidity is now flowing. This is from Avamore and I'm pretty sure though not certain it relates to a LST remediation. The funding was secured in December and  if so, could be the start of the awaited Estate roll-outs. This would certainly be excellent as part of anticipated t/u. https://benews.co.uk/avamore-capital-completes-5m-pbsa-refinance-and-remediation-facility/",

Most big builders and real estate companies signed up to the Government Building Safety Pledge giving substance to the need to rectify existing cladding issues. Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

I suppose you'll get those who want to crystallise their gain before Christmas but I expect the big jump up will come fairly soon anyway. Preliminary contracts with (at least) two big real estate companies bodes well for PFP. The upside given the minimal Capex required and ability to quickly scale is significant. The demand to address flammable cladding issues is high up the government agenda so should come sooner rather than later. Given the small MCap here, one has to expect volatility but the pendulum swings quickly on good news. Happy to be patient and great entry point before we see 10p imo. Too much going on here for the RNS feed to stay silent for long.",

I started buying here when Holliday was selling off and that was in the 3p's so not sure by any measure, that it has been a successful investment decision for him as yet. I am prepared to wait and see what happens here and still would like to add more when able. As for other Companies they will do what they do, I have had a very good year so far, but am also looking into other things that could affect stocks in general and those might be worth considering now, with the markets quite frothy and plenty ofthings that could cause a rebalancing event, that could affect every company irrespective of their individual potentials.",

The first leg of this rerate has offered opportunity for short term profit and traders have taken some off the table. Personally I prefer to look as the bigger picture unfolds. Stale holders are going and being replaced by the majority with holdings above 5p. Consolidation is all about finding the right level before the next leg.

I had hoped the market would appreciate the very positive vibes coming from the BoD but it appears to be waiting for the follow through. The oscillations are to be expected as the buy/sell balance readjusts amplified by the small number of free shares in circulation. I think we've hit the crucial reversion level now as PFP news could arrive quickly as initial contracts complete. 'IF' the 2 major real estate players do decide to roll out Injectaclad across their estates then the MCap here looks massively undervalued. Given also that CEM and AgTech are both pulling in business  it should prove rewarding for those sitting in the saddle.",

I bet if you had sold here you would have invested elsewhere and then according to your theory that share would have dropped because of wrecker Rachel.

They hold significant % of shares leaving a small free-float. That's why the shareprice can be volatile. The upside is that the next decent RNS could easily have a significant effect. The uptrend from recent lows is firmly established with increased confidence in outlook. Yes it's receded from the peak but that's a necessary element of consolidation before the next upward move. This step-like progress is the only way a decent share like this can reflect sustained buying pressure over time. Don't look day to day look at the bigger picture.",

The underlying quality and commitment of the management team is fundamental. Are their aims aligned with all shareholders and do they hold a 'significant' shareholding in their own company. Are their goals  aspirations and achievements being reflected in the company's progress. Are they organically growing and nurturing the businesses under their control whilst acquiring and assimilating good quality additions. Are the companies in high growth fields rather than mature or fading industries. Do they keep investors in touch with developments whilst not over-promising and under-delivering. Then stand back and think....has this got all the credentials to be a serious \u00a3100m turnover business in a sensible time frame? If the answer is yes, then you're already invested here. Job done.

Some fallback was essential to ensure the next upswing is stronger and sustained. The company has 3 constituent parts, all in must-have fields for future growth, and the seasoned and deeply invested management are quietly getting on with business. Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony. Solid British innovation that should be being rewarded with more onshore investors. Time the bigger instos took a look.",

Do the research and look at the interim statements: PFP revenues in the Period grew significantly to \u00a31.0m (H1 2024: \u00a30.3m), with average gross margins increased to 64.3% (H1 2024: 41.2%). AGT revenues grew to \u00a30.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.4m), with average gross margins of 42.0% (H1 2024: 48.4%) and CEM generated revenues of \u00a33.6m (H1 2024: \u00a34.5m). Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors. That is being fully addressed with multiple engagements focussed on the desire of UK industries to increasingly onshore, particularly in defence. Margins in the other two businesses are excellent so progress should be swift. Good time to board the train imo if not already invested and increasing.",

Given the size and backlog of projects in all three divisions it is only a matter of time before the staircase moves again. The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight.

A lot has happened since then and that division has secured new contracts whilst also purposefully engaging with and targetting the defence sector (Nov RNS). The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation. This is an excellent UK small cap deserving of a rating which reflects it's pipeline, management and skillset.",

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

A lot has happened since then and that division has secured new contracts whilst also purposefully engaging with and targetting the defence sector (Nov RNS). The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation. This is an excellent UK small cap deserving of a rating which reflects it's pipeline, management and skillset.",

Major real estate holders are working with LST and it would appear that funding liquidity is now flowing. This is from Avamore and I'm pretty sure though not certain it relates to a LST remediation. The funding was secured in December and  if so, could be the start of the awaited Estate roll-outs. This would certainly be excellent as part of anticipated t/u. https://benews.co.uk/avamore-capital-completes-5m-pbsa-refinance-and-remediation-facility/",

Most big builders and real estate companies signed up to the Government Building Safety Pledge giving substance to the need to rectify existing cladding issues. Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Preliminary contracts with (at least) two big real estate companies bodes well for PFP. The upside given the minimal Capex required and ability to quickly scale is significant. The demand to address flammable cladding issues is high up the government agenda so should come sooner rather than later. Given the small MCap here, one has to expect volatility but the pendulum swings quickly on good news. Happy to be patient and great entry point before we see 10p imo.

I started buying here when Holliday was selling off and that was in the 3p's so not sure by any measure, that it has been a successful investment decision for him as yet. I am prepared to wait and see what happens here and still would like to add more when able. As for other Companies they will do what they do, I have had a very good year so far, but am also looking into other things that could affect stocks in general and those might be worth considering now, with the markets quite frothy and plenty ofthings that could cause a rebalancing event, that could affect every company irrespective of their individual potentials.",

The first leg of this rerate has offered opportunity for short term profit and traders have taken some off the table. Personally I prefer to look as the bigger picture unfolds. Stale holders are going and being replaced by the majority with holdings above 5p. Consolidation is all about finding the right level before the next leg.

I had hoped the market would appreciate the very positive vibes coming from the BoD but it appears to be waiting for the follow through. The oscillations are to be expected as the buy/sell balance readjusts amplified by the small number of free shares in circulation. I think we've hit the crucial reversion level now as PFP news could arrive quickly as initial contracts complete. 'IF' the 2 major real estate players do decide to roll out Injectaclad across their estates then the MCap here looks massively undervalued. Given also that CEM and AgTech are both pulling in business  it should prove rewarding for those sitting in the saddle.",

Food security, cladding issues and the need to onshore electronic manufacturing are key and pressing issues that will not subside or go away. Light Science Tech is centred on all three of these. It is not a one-trick pony share. Look at the management, research their dedication and seasoned, prudent approach and their hands-on attitude to growth. They hold significant % of shares leaving a small free-float. That's why the shareprice can be volatile. The upside is that the next decent RNS could easily have a significant effect. The uptrend from recent lows is firmly established with increased confidence in outlook. Yes it's receded from the peak but that's a necessary element of consolidation before the next upward move. This step-like progress is the only way a decent share like this can reflect sustained buying pressure over time. Don't look day to day look at the bigger picture.",

LST is building institutional trust before chasing valuation \u2014 a slow but compounding advantage.

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

A lot has happened since then and that division has secured new contracts whilst also purposefully engaging with and targetting the defence sector (Nov RNS). The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation. This is an excellent UK small cap deserving of a rating which reflects it's pipeline, management and skillset.",

We also know that two tier 1 real estate players will now have completed initial Injectaclad contracts with the PFP division. Both of these will require major discussion with end-users which has probably been protracted due to the Christmas break. The roll-out of Injectaclad is compelling on both a cost and time basis. The deadline for starting cladding remediation is now 6 months away or owners of affected buildings face huge penalty fines. This is a solid little UK company with three active arms and good IP. For those with patience it 'should' reward handsomely.

The market isn\u2019t being impatient; it\u2019s applying a rational discount after several years where structure and pipeline visibility outpaced contracted scale. The share price reflects that history. What has changed is business quality. LST now has three coherent pillars, real revenue, granted IP, and exposure to regulated or regulation-adjacent markets where trust and provenance matter. CEM remains the low-margin base, AgTech is still early but technically validated, and Injectaclad is the high-margin option that could materially change group economics if it secures framework-level work. The case doesn\u2019t rely on all pipelines converting \u2014 it relies on one clear proof point. Either a multi-site AgTech deployment or a Tier-1 PFP framework would be enough to reset risk perception and funding assumptions. Until then, the current discount is justified. In a risk-off market, that works both ways. Weaker stories are being purged, while businesses with real revenues, government-validated IP, and structural demand drivers are being ignored. That creates asymmetry: defined downside, with the potential for a sharp re-rating if a single scale signal lands. I think that signal is very close plus CEM could surprise on the defence contract side.",

While it is true LST now has a clear three-pillar structure (CEM, AgTech, and PFP/Injectaclad), structure is merely a framework; the market prices the results that framework produces. The reality for long-term holders is a matter of record. From a 2021 IPO at 10p and peaks above 25p, the price currently sits around 4.25p. This represents a 60\u201380% erosion of capital for those in since the early days. Even for those who entered during the 2023/24 \"flatline,\" the investment hasn't yet delivered a meaningful re-rating. CEM (UK Circuits): Still the engine room, providing 70.3% of Group revenue as of the H1 2025 results. While it\u2019s diversifying into transport and medical sectors, it remains a lower-margin foundation. AgTech: Growing (revenue up to \u00a30.5m in H1 25), but still represents a small fraction of the total business. The market is waiting for the \u00a334m pipeline to move from \"quoted\" to \"contracted.\" Injectaclad (PFP): This is the high-margin hope (64% gross margins). While we have seen RNS wins totalling \u00a30.45m for hotel and school remediations recently, we haven't yet seen the Tier-1, multi-million-pound \"rollout\" that would justify a radical shift in valuation. To be fair, the maiden operating profit in H1 2025 was a step forward, but with a pre-tax loss of \u00a30.16m and a history of fundraises, the \"path to sustainability\" is still being paved with shareholder dilution. If those significant contracts in the \u00a358m pipeline finally land and the numbers move, the sentiment will shift. But until then, the market isn't being \"impatient\" it is applying a risk discount until the evidence of scale is undeniable.",

The real reward is yet to roll out as news of significant contracts comes out in the near future. How long is patient? I'm happy here. Good solid little UK business.",

That leaves the door open for the Injectaclad division to work through it's big quoted workload. Highly cost effective, good margins and cheap for LST to scale. AgTech is progressing strongly and the CEM division should have good news from its recent engagement with the defence industry. Next t/u should confirm that progress. Solid company whose MCap should be in the \u00a330m+ category given it's diversity and speciality exposure.",

The upside is that virtually all stale holders will now have exited and we have a raft of new investors here at prices in excess of today. Fundamentals are all sound and in place with competent and seasoned (and deeply invested) management in place. Lots of potential news triggers to relight interest here and it's a superb target for 2026 investment comment in the run up to Christmas and New Year. I can see this easily doubling to a \u00a330m MCap and above in 2026 given potential and quoted order pipeline. Injectaclad is the elephant in the room as urgency to rectify cladding issues intensifies and unlocks that side of the business book. AgTech has the ability to surprise and CEM has been courting the defence sector. Definitely not a share to be out of over the festive period. Got to be in it to benefit from the raft of RNS that could fall on the desk at any time. Given the regular and informative RNS stream, one looks imminent.",

Given the size and backlog of projects in all three divisions it is only a matter of time before the staircase moves again. The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight. I expect a trading update within the next few weeks and the positivity in that could be fairly transformational if related to Injectaclad roll-outs or AgriTech major adoption.",

AGT revenues grew to \u00a30.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.4m), with average gross margins of 42.0% (H1 2024: 48.4%) and CEM generated revenues of \u00a33.6m (H1 2024: \u00a34.5m). Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors. That is being fully addressed with multiple engagements focussed on the desire of UK industries to increasingly onshore, particularly in defence. Margins in the other two businesses are excellent so progress should be swift. Good time to board the train imo if not already invested and increasing.",

Some fallback was essential to ensure the next upswing is stronger and sustained. The company has 3 constituent parts, all in must-have fields for future growth, and the seasoned and deeply invested management are quietly getting on with business. Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony. Solid British innovation that should be being rewarded with more onshore investors. Time the bigger instos took a look.",

According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Most big builders and real estate companies signed up to the Government Building Safety Pledge giving substance to the need to rectify existing cladding issues. Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation.

The market isn\u2019t being impatient; it\u2019s applying a rational discount after several years where structure and pipeline visibility outpaced contracted scale. The share price reflects that history. What has changed is business quality. LST now has three coherent pillars, real revenue, granted IP, and exposure to regulated or regulation-adjacent markets where trust and provenance matter. CEM remains the low-margin base, AgTech is still early but technically validated, and Injectaclad is the high-margin option that could materially change group economics if it secures framework-level work. The case doesn\u2019t rely on all pipelines converting \u2014 it relies on one clear proof point. Either a multi-site AgTech deployment or a Tier-1 PFP framework would be enough to reset risk perception and funding assumptions. Until then, the current discount is justified. In a risk-off market, that works both ways. Weaker stories are being purged, while businesses with real revenues, government-validated IP, and structural demand drivers are being ignored. That creates asymmetry: defined downside, with the potential for a sharp re-rating if a single scale signal lands. I think that signal is very close plus CEM could surprise on the defence contract side.",

While it is true LST now has a clear three-pillar structure (CEM, AgTech, and PFP/Injectaclad), structure is merely a framework; the market prices the results that framework produces. The reality for long-term holders is a matter of record. From a 2021 IPO at 10p and peaks above 25p, the price currently sits around 4.25p. This represents a 60\u201380% erosion of capital for those in since the early days. Even for those who entered during the 2023/24 \"flatline,\" the investment hasn't yet delivered a meaningful re-rating. CEM (UK Circuits): Still the engine room, providing 70.3% of Group revenue as of the H1 2025 results. While it\u2019s diversifying into transport and medical sectors, it remains a lower-margin foundation. AgTech: Growing (revenue up to \u00a30.5m in H1 25), but still represents a small fraction of the total business. The market is waiting for the \u00a334m pipeline to move from \"quoted\" to \"contracted.\" Injectaclad (PFP): This is the high-margin hope (64% gross margins). While we have seen RNS wins totalling \u00a30.45m for hotel and school remediations recently, we haven't yet seen the Tier-1, multi-million-pound \"rollout\" that would justify a radical shift in valuation. To be fair, the maiden operating profit in H1 2025 was a step forward, but with a pre-tax loss of \u00a30.16m and a history of fundraises, the \"path to sustainability\" is still being paved with shareholder dilution. If those significant contracts in the \u00a358m pipeline finally land and the numbers move, the sentiment will shift. But until then, the market isn't being \"impatient\" it is applying a risk discount until the evidence of scale is undeniable.",

The CEM division is now focussed, supplying the expanding AgTech division and the added PFP Injectaclad division has just completed trials with two tier 1 real estate holders. I agree it's taken longer than initially anticipated but for those of us who invested in the flatline period 2 years ago it's been a decent investment. Yes it spiked on good news and impatient holders sold. Good luck to them - they took money off the table and more investors got on board at a higher price than now. The real reward is yet to roll out as news of significant contracts comes out in the near future. How long is patient? I'm happy here. Good solid little UK business.",

The share price has fallen from over 25p in 2021 to under 4p today a decline of almost 80% over four years. That isn\u2019t rewarding patient investment; it\u2019s eroding it. The hybrid model and IP story may sound compelling, but the market prices outcomes, not narratives.

A highly motivated management with skin in the game and multiple near term inflection drivers to propel the MCap upwards. Primarily, the government is currently addressing the issue of flammable cladding on many buildings. It said that funding  and the backlog would be cleared by the end of 2025. That leaves the door open for the Injectaclad division to work through it's big quoted workload. Highly cost effective, good margins and cheap for LST to scale. AgTech is progressing strongly and the CEM division should have good news from its recent engagement with the defence industry. Next t/u should confirm that progress. Solid company whose MCap should be in the \u00a330m+ category given it's diversity and speciality exposure.",

The upside is that virtually all stale holders will now have exited and we have a raft of new investors here at prices in excess of today. Fundamentals are all sound and in place with competent and seasoned (and deeply invested) management in place. Lots of potential news triggers to relight interest here and it's a superb target for 2026 investment comment in the run up to Christmas and New Year. I can see this easily doubling to a \u00a330m MCap and above in 2026 given potential and quoted order pipeline. Injectaclad is the elephant in the room as urgency to rectify cladding issues intensifies and unlocks that side of the business book. AgTech has the ability to surprise and CEM has been courting the defence sector. Definitely not a share to be out of over the festive period. Got to be in it to benefit from the raft of RNS that could fall on the desk at any time. Given the regular and informative RNS stream, one looks imminent.",

The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight. I expect a trading update within the next few weeks and the positivity in that could be fairly transformational if related to Injectaclad roll-outs or AgriTech major adoption.",

AGT revenues grew to \u00a30.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.4m), with average gross margins of 42.0% (H1 2024: 48.4%) and CEM generated revenues of \u00a33.6m (H1 2024: \u00a34.5m). Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors. That is being fully addressed with multiple engagements focussed on the desire of UK industries to increasingly onshore, particularly in defence. Margins in the other two businesses are excellent so progress should be swift. Good time to board the train imo if not already invested and increasing.",

Some fallback was essential to ensure the next upswing is stronger and sustained. The company has 3 constituent parts, all in must-have fields for future growth, and the seasoned and deeply invested management are quietly getting on with business. Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony. Solid British innovation that should be being rewarded with more onshore investors. Time the bigger instos took a look.",

(This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Most big builders and real estate companies signed up to the Government Building Safety Pledge giving substance to the need to rectify existing cladding issues. Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation.

The market isn\u2019t being impatient; it\u2019s applying a rational discount after several years where structure and pipeline visibility outpaced contracted scale. The share price reflects that history. What has changed is business quality. LST now has three coherent pillars, real revenue, granted IP, and exposure to regulated or regulation-adjacent markets where trust and provenance matter. CEM remains the low-margin base, AgTech is still early but technically validated, and Injectaclad is the high-margin option that could materially change group economics if it secures framework-level work. The case doesn\u2019t rely on all pipelines converting \u2014 it relies on one clear proof point. Either a multi-site AgTech deployment or a Tier-1 PFP framework would be enough to reset risk perception and funding assumptions. Until then, the current discount is justified. In a risk-off market, that works both ways. Weaker stories are being purged, while businesses with real revenues, government-validated IP, and structural demand drivers are being ignored. That creates asymmetry: defined downside, with the potential for a sharp re-rating if a single scale signal lands. I think that signal is very close plus CEM could surprise on the defence contract side.",

The reality for long-term holders is a matter of record. From a 2021 IPO at 10p and peaks above 25p, the price currently sits around 4.25p. This represents a 60\u201380% erosion of capital for those in since the early days. Even for those who entered during the 2023/24 \"flatline,\" the investment hasn't yet delivered a meaningful re-rating. CEM (UK Circuits): Still the engine room, providing 70.3% of Group revenue as of the H1 2025 results. While it\u2019s diversifying into transport and medical sectors, it remains a lower-margin foundation. AgTech: Growing (revenue up to \u00a30.5m in H1 25), but still represents a small fraction of the total business. The market is waiting for the \u00a334m pipeline to move from \"quoted\" to \"contracted.\" Injectaclad (PFP): This is the high-margin hope (64% gross margins). While we have seen RNS wins totalling \u00a30.45m for hotel and school remediations recently, we haven't yet seen the Tier-1, multi-million-pound \"rollout\" that would justify a radical shift in valuation. To be fair, the maiden operating profit in H1 2025 was a step forward, but with a pre-tax loss of \u00a30.16m and a history of fundraises, the \"path to sustainability\" is still being paved with shareholder dilution. If those significant contracts in the \u00a358m pipeline finally land and the numbers move, the sentiment will shift. But until then, the market isn't being \"impatient\" it is applying a risk discount until the evidence of scale is undeniable.",

Given that Capex to expand is minimal that goes straight to the bottom line if all goes to plan. The other two divisions AgTech and CEM are also looking at increased work. A trading update has been issued in either Dec or Jan historically so anticipation will come into play I'm sure.

Primarily, the government is currently addressing the issue of flammable cladding on many buildings. It said that funding  and the backlog would be cleared by the end of 2025. That leaves the door open for the Injectaclad division to work through it's big quoted workload. Highly cost effective, good margins and cheap for LST to scale. AgTech is progressing strongly and the CEM division should have good news from its recent engagement with the defence industry. Next t/u should confirm that progress.

Fundamentals are all sound and in place with competent and seasoned (and deeply invested) management in place. Lots of potential news triggers to relight interest here and it's a superb target for 2026 investment comment in the run up to Christmas and New Year. I can see this easily doubling to a \u00a330m MCap and above in 2026 given potential and quoted order pipeline. Injectaclad is the elephant in the room as urgency to rectify cladding issues intensifies and unlocks that side of the business book. AgTech has the ability to surprise and CEM has been courting the defence sector. Definitely not a share to be out of over the festive period.

It can be frustrating for short-term holders who jump from loss to loss not realising that the amplification works much more as news is released. The upward trend and progress of the company is key which are both positive over the last year. Given the size and backlog of projects in all three divisions it is only a matter of time before the staircase moves again. The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight. I expect a trading update within the next few weeks and the positivity in that could be fairly transformational if related to Injectaclad roll-outs or AgriTech major adoption.",

AGT revenues grew to \u00a30.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.4m), with average gross margins of 42.0% (H1 2024: 48.4%) and CEM generated revenues of \u00a33.6m (H1 2024: \u00a34.5m). Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors. That is being fully addressed with multiple engagements focussed on the desire of UK industries to increasingly onshore, particularly in defence. Margins in the other two businesses are excellent so progress should be swift. Good time to board the train imo if not already invested and increasing.",

Some fallback was essential to ensure the next upswing is stronger and sustained. The company has 3 constituent parts, all in must-have fields for future growth, and the seasoned and deeply invested management are quietly getting on with business. Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony. Solid British innovation that should be being rewarded with more onshore investors. Time the bigger instos took a look.",

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation.

With the end of life of one of the Pest Control products I think revenue in the electronics division will be substantially lower in H2 2025 than H2 2024. The only new Fire contracts announced in H2 2025 were the \u00a30.45m announced in August. Unless there were a lot of unannounced smaller contracts I think Fire revenue in H2 2025 could be substantially lower then the \u00a31.5m in H2 2024. It seems good progress is being made in the Ag Tech division but I think overall revenues for the company in 2025 could be substantially lower than 2024.",

The market isn\u2019t being impatient; it\u2019s applying a rational discount after several years where structure and pipeline visibility outpaced contracted scale. The share price reflects that history. What has changed is business quality. LST now has three coherent pillars, real revenue, granted IP, and exposure to regulated or regulation-adjacent markets where trust and provenance matter. CEM remains the low-margin base, AgTech is still early but technically validated, and Injectaclad is the high-margin option that could materially change group economics if it secures framework-level work. The case doesn\u2019t rely on all pipelines converting \u2014 it relies on one clear proof point. Either a multi-site AgTech deployment or a Tier-1 PFP framework would be enough to reset risk perception and funding assumptions. Until then, the current discount is justified. In a risk-off market, that works both ways. Weaker stories are being purged, while businesses with real revenues, government-validated IP, and structural demand drivers are being ignored. That creates asymmetry: defined downside, with the potential for a sharp re-rating if a single scale signal lands. I think that signal is very close plus CEM could surprise on the defence contract side.",

          "content": "I understand the focus on long-term timeframes, but the fundamentals eventually have to justify that patience. While it is true LST now has a clear three-pillar structure (CEM, AgTech, and PFP/Injectaclad), structure is merely a framework; the market prices the results that framework produces. The reality for long-term holders is a matter of record. From a 2021 IPO at 10p and peaks above 25p, the price currently sits around 4.25p. This represents a 60\u201380% erosion of capital for those in since the early days. Even for those who entered during the 2023/24 \"flatline,\" the investment hasn't yet delivered a meaningful re-rating. CEM (UK Circuits): Still the engine room, providing 70.3% of Group revenue as of the H1 2025 results. While it\u2019s diversifying into transport and medical sectors, it remains a lower-margin foundation. AgTech: Growing (revenue up to \u00a30.5m in H1 25), but still represents a small fraction of the total business. The market is waiting for the \u00a334m pipeline to move from \"quoted\" to \"contracted.\" Injectaclad (PFP): This is the high-margin hope (64% gross margins). While we have seen RNS wins totalling \u00a30.45m for hotel and school remediations recently, we haven't yet seen the Tier-1, multi-million-pound \"rollout\" that would justify a radical shift in valuation. To be fair, the maiden operating profit in H1 2025 was a step forward, but with a pre-tax loss of \u00a30.16m and a history of fundraises, the \"path to sustainability\" is still being paved with shareholder dilution. If those significant contracts in the \u00a358m pipeline finally land and the numbers move, the sentiment will shift. But until then, the market isn't being \"impatient\" it is applying a risk discount until the evidence of scale is undeniable.",

Primarily, the government is currently addressing the issue of flammable cladding on many buildings. It said that funding  and the backlog would be cleared by the end of 2025. That leaves the door open for the Injectaclad division to work through it's big quoted workload. Highly cost effective, good margins and cheap for LST to scale.

Fundamentals are all sound and in place with competent and seasoned (and deeply invested) management in place. Lots of potential news triggers to relight interest here and it's a superb target for 2026 investment comment in the run up to Christmas and New Year. I can see this easily doubling to a \u00a330m MCap and above in 2026 given potential and quoted order pipeline. Injectaclad is the elephant in the room as urgency to rectify cladding issues intensifies and unlocks that side of the business book. AgTech has the ability to surprise and CEM has been courting the defence sector. Definitely not a share to be out of over the festive period.

The upward trend and progress of the company is key which are both positive over the last year. Given the size and backlog of projects in all three divisions it is only a matter of time before the staircase moves again. The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight. I expect a trading update within the next few weeks and the positivity in that could be fairly transformational if related to Injectaclad roll-outs or AgriTech major adoption.",

AGT revenues grew to \u00a30.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.4m), with average gross margins of 42.0% (H1 2024: 48.4%) and CEM generated revenues of \u00a33.6m (H1 2024: \u00a34.5m). Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors. That is being fully addressed with multiple engagements focussed on the desire of UK industries to increasingly onshore, particularly in defence. Margins in the other two businesses are excellent so progress should be swift. Good time to board the train imo if not already invested and increasing.",

Some fallback was essential to ensure the next upswing is stronger and sustained. The company has 3 constituent parts, all in must-have fields for future growth, and the seasoned and deeply invested management are quietly getting on with business. Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony. Solid British innovation that should be being rewarded with more onshore investors. Time the bigger instos took a look.",

The huge  quoted  pipeline for sorting these buildings out by LST's PFP division  will come to fruition sooner rather than later. At the same time water and energy are under stress globally and the relatively low prices for natural gas, fertilisers and so forth is unlikely to persist - to the likely benefit of the Agtech business.

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Most big builders and real estate companies signed up to the Government Building Safety Pledge giving substance to the need to rectify existing cladding issues. Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

A lot has happened since then and that division has secured new contracts whilst also purposefully engaging with and targetting the defence sector (Nov RNS). The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation. This is an excellent UK small cap deserving of a rating which reflects it's pipeline, management and skillset.",

With the end of life of one of the Pest Control products I think revenue in the electronics division will be substantially lower in H2 2025 than H2 2024. The only new Fire contracts announced in H2 2025 were the \u00a30.45m announced in August. Unless there were a lot of unannounced smaller contracts I think Fire revenue in H2 2025 could be substantially lower then the \u00a31.5m in H2 2024. It seems good progress is being made in the Ag Tech division but I think overall revenues for the company in 2025 could be substantially lower than 2024.",

The market isn\u2019t being impatient; it\u2019s applying a rational discount after several years where structure and pipeline visibility outpaced contracted scale. The share price reflects that history. What has changed is business quality. LST now has three coherent pillars, real revenue, granted IP, and exposure to regulated or regulation-adjacent markets where trust and provenance matter. CEM remains the low-margin base, AgTech is still early but technically validated, and Injectaclad is the high-margin option that could materially change group economics if it secures framework-level work. The case doesn\u2019t rely on all pipelines converting \u2014 it relies on one clear proof point. Either a multi-site AgTech deployment or a Tier-1 PFP framework would be enough to reset risk perception and funding assumptions. Until then, the current discount is justified. In a risk-off market, that works both ways. Weaker stories are being purged, while businesses with real revenues, government-validated IP, and structural demand drivers are being ignored. That creates asymmetry: defined downside, with the potential for a sharp re-rating if a single scale signal lands. I think that signal is very close plus CEM could surprise on the defence contract side.",

          "content": "I understand the focus on long-term timeframes, but the fundamentals eventually have to justify that patience. While it is true LST now has a clear three-pillar structure (CEM, AgTech, and PFP/Injectaclad), structure is merely a framework; the market prices the results that framework produces. The reality for long-term holders is a matter of record. From a 2021 IPO at 10p and peaks above 25p, the price currently sits around 4.25p. This represents a 60\u201380% erosion of capital for those in since the early days. Even for those who entered during the 2023/24 \"flatline,\" the investment hasn't yet delivered a meaningful re-rating. CEM (UK Circuits): Still the engine room, providing 70.3% of Group revenue as of the H1 2025 results. While it\u2019s diversifying into transport and medical sectors, it remains a lower-margin foundation. AgTech: Growing (revenue up to \u00a30.5m in H1 25), but still represents a small fraction of the total business. The market is waiting for the \u00a334m pipeline to move from \"quoted\" to \"contracted.\" Injectaclad (PFP): This is the high-margin hope (64% gross margins). While we have seen RNS wins totalling \u00a30.45m for hotel and school remediations recently, we haven't yet seen the Tier-1, multi-million-pound \"rollout\" that would justify a radical shift in valuation. To be fair, the maiden operating profit in H1 2025 was a step forward, but with a pre-tax loss of \u00a30.16m and a history of fundraises, the \"path to sustainability\" is still being paved with shareholder dilution. If those significant contracts in the \u00a358m pipeline finally land and the numbers move, the sentiment will shift. But until then, the market isn't being \"impatient\" it is applying a risk discount until the evidence of scale is undeniable.",

Primarily, the government is currently addressing the issue of flammable cladding on many buildings. It said that funding  and the backlog would be cleared by the end of 2025. That leaves the door open for the Injectaclad division to work through it's big quoted workload. Highly cost effective, good margins and cheap for LST to scale.

Fundamentals are all sound and in place with competent and seasoned (and deeply invested) management in place. Lots of potential news triggers to relight interest here and it's a superb target for 2026 investment comment in the run up to Christmas and New Year. I can see this easily doubling to a \u00a330m MCap and above in 2026 given potential and quoted order pipeline. Injectaclad is the elephant in the room as urgency to rectify cladding issues intensifies and unlocks that side of the business book. AgTech has the ability to surprise and CEM has been courting the defence sector. Definitely not a share to be out of over the festive period.

The upward trend and progress of the company is key which are both positive over the last year. Given the size and backlog of projects in all three divisions it is only a matter of time before the staircase moves again. The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight. I expect a trading update within the next few weeks and the positivity in that could be fairly transformational if related to Injectaclad roll-outs or AgriTech major adoption.",

AGT revenues grew to \u00a30.5m (H1 2024: \u00a30.4m), with average gross margins of 42.0% (H1 2024: 48.4%) and CEM generated revenues of \u00a33.6m (H1 2024: \u00a34.5m). Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors. That is being fully addressed with multiple engagements focussed on the desire of UK industries to increasingly onshore, particularly in defence. Margins in the other two businesses are excellent so progress should be swift. Good time to board the train imo if not already invested and increasing.",

The company has 3 constituent parts, all in must-have fields for future growth, and the seasoned and deeply invested management are quietly getting on with business. Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony.

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Most big builders and real estate companies signed up to the Government Building Safety Pledge giving substance to the need to rectify existing cladding issues. Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

A lot has happened since then and that division has secured new contracts whilst also purposefully engaging with and targetting the defence sector (Nov RNS). The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation. This is an excellent UK small cap deserving of a rating which reflects it's pipeline, management and skillset.",

The only new Fire contracts announced in H2 2025 were the \u00a30.45m announced in August. Unless there were a lot of unannounced smaller contracts I think Fire revenue in H2 2025 could be substantially lower then the \u00a31.5m in H2 2024.

We also know that two tier 1 real estate players will now have completed initial Injectaclad contracts with the PFP division. Both of these will require major discussion with end-users which has probably been protracted due to the Christmas break. The roll-out of Injectaclad is compelling on both a cost and time basis. The deadline for starting cladding remediation is now 6 months away or owners of affected buildings face huge penalty fines. This is a solid little UK company with three active arms and good IP. For those with patience it 'should' reward handsomely. It's obvious that some holders can't wait - fair enough, but volumes are still low, shares are tightly held and no holdings notices have been declared. Just a sit and await developments pe\u0155iod.",

The market isn\u2019t being impatient; it\u2019s applying a rational discount after several years where structure and pipeline visibility outpaced contracted scale. The share price reflects that history. What has changed is business quality. LST now has three coherent pillars, real revenue, granted IP, and exposure to regulated or regulation-adjacent markets where trust and provenance matter. CEM remains the low-margin base, AgTech is still early but technically validated, and Injectaclad is the high-margin option that could materially change group economics if it secures framework-level work. The case doesn\u2019t rely on all pipelines converting \u2014 it relies on one clear proof point. Either a multi-site AgTech deployment or a Tier-1 PFP framework would be enough to reset risk perception and funding assumptions. Until then, the current discount is justified. In a risk-off market, that works both ways. Weaker stories are being purged, while businesses with real revenues, government-validated IP, and structural demand drivers are being ignored. That creates asymmetry: defined downside, with the potential for a sharp re-rating if a single scale signal lands. I think that signal is very close plus CEM could surprise on the defence contract side.",

While it is true LST now has a clear three-pillar structure (CEM, AgTech, and PFP/Injectaclad), structure is merely a framework; the market prices the results that framework produces. The reality for long-term holders is a matter of record. From a 2021 IPO at 10p and peaks above 25p, the price currently sits around 4.25p. This represents a 60\u201380% erosion of capital for those in since the early days. Even for those who entered during the 2023/24 \"flatline,\" the investment hasn't yet delivered a meaningful re-rating. CEM (UK Circuits): Still the engine room, providing 70.3% of Group revenue as of the H1 2025 results. While it\u2019s diversifying into transport and medical sectors, it remains a lower-margin foundation. AgTech: Growing (revenue up to \u00a30.5m in H1 25), but still represents a small fraction of the total business. The market is waiting for the \u00a334m pipeline to move from \"quoted\" to \"contracted.\" Injectaclad (PFP): This is the high-margin hope (64% gross margins). While we have seen RNS wins totalling \u00a30.45m for hotel and school remediations recently, we haven't yet seen the Tier-1, multi-million-pound \"rollout\" that would justify a radical shift in valuation. To be fair, the maiden operating profit in H1 2025 was a step forward, but with a pre-tax loss of \u00a30.16m and a history of fundraises, the \"path to sustainability\" is still being paved with shareholder dilution. If those significant contracts in the \u00a358m pipeline finally land and the numbers move, the sentiment will shift. But until then, the market isn't being \"impatient\" it is applying a risk discount until the evidence of scale is undeniable.",

The upside is that virtually all stale holders will now have exited and we have a raft of new investors here at prices in excess of today. Fundamentals are all sound and in place with competent and seasoned (and deeply invested) management in place. Lots of potential news triggers to relight interest here and it's a superb target for 2026 investment comment in the run up to Christmas and New Year. I can see this easily doubling to a \u00a330m MCap and above in 2026 given potential and quoted order pipeline. Injectaclad is the elephant in the room as urgency to rectify cladding issues intensifies and unlocks that side of the business book. AgTech has the ability to surprise and CEM has been courting the defence sector. Definitely not a share to be out of over the festive period. Got to be in it to benefit from the raft of RNS that could fall on the desk at any time. Given the regular and informative RNS stream, one looks imminent.",

Given the size and backlog of projects in all three divisions it is only a matter of time before the staircase moves again. The spike was the result of good news so expect more and a rising base level after each. If you've done the research here and the case for is vesting is still there ( or hugely increased at this level) then just hold tight.

Importantly, CEM achieved gross margins of 27.8% (H1 2024: 23.7%), as the sales mix was more diverse and targeted. This resulted in an increased Group gross profit margin of 36.3% for the Period, up considerably from 26.6% in the first six months of 2024 and up from 30.3% for the 2024 full year. Clearly CEM is the arm that was underperforming due to various factors.

The company has 3 constituent parts, all in must-have fields for future growth, and the seasoned and deeply invested management are quietly getting on with business. Each of the 3 arms could be next to RNS progress and a t/u is usually given in either Dec or Jan. If I had to guess, Injectaclad should be the first to herald a big increase in order conversion as the government ploughs money and effort into resolving the cladding issue. It is prioritising this in order to free up renting and mortgage bottlenecks and has said Dec or Jan should see very positive indications of movement. This should feed directly to LST bottom line. Also the engagement of CEM directly with defence companies in November should start to show progress. AgTech is also at the forefront as the northern hemisphere dark nights are here and food production increases come to the fore. All in all I'm confident this will resume it's upward trajectory. It's one of the few companies that are running into sustained profitability with a clear runway and isn't a one-trick pony.

Its closest structural peers are integrated, IP-led systems suppliers rather than single-product vendors. LST\u2019s hybrid model (manufacture + IP + data + compliance-driven markets) is harder to value but more resilient if executed properly. LST\u2019s IP supports product families and upgrades, which is a prerequisite for repeat orders, retrofits and subscription data layers.  LST is building institutional trust before chasing valuation \u2014 a slow but compounding advantage. This is fundamental because risk is low relative to many AIM tech names because real revenue exists, multiple end markets exist and most importantly,  IP is not single-point-of-failure. In short, it' the profile of a company that frustrates short-term traders but rewards patient capital investment.",

          "content": "The original Government Building Safety Pledge was aimed at major developers committing to pay for or remediate unsafe cladding and other life-critical fire safety defects on residential buildings over 11 m tall that they built in the past 30 years. According to official government records, around 49 developers had signed the pledge (also referred to as the developer remediation contract) committing to fix unsafe buildings they developed or refurbished. Examples of signatories include: Barratt, Bellway, Berkeley Group, Crest Nicholson, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Wimpey and many others \u2014 50+ major housebuilders across the sector. (This pledge is separate from other government remediation plans involving social landlords (which saw at least 110 social landlords sign a joint plan). Developers who signed up have agreed to identify buildings they developed that have life-critical fire safety defects (including unsafe cladding) and fund or carry out remediation. Those who failed to sign risk restrictions on their ability to operate (e.g., planning permissions and building control) until they comply. Its meant to protect leaseholders \u2014 so they are not left with the bills for safety fixes they had no role in creating. The pledge ensures the industry pays rather than leaseholders (in many cases) under schemes like the Cladding Safety Scheme or Building Safety Fund. It creates legal obligations and enforcement mechanisms if developers fail to act. There are thousands of buildings needing cladding remediation; as of late 2025, only about 35 % had completed works, and around 49 % had at least started remedial works. A significant number of buildings still haven\u2019t been identified or assessed (government estimates suggest hundreds to potentially thousands remain to be fully catalogued). The Building Safety Pledge represents significant industry commitment to remediate dangerous cladding, but sheer scale, regulatory bottlenecks, legal complexities, backlog in approvals and data gaps mean remediation is still slow \u2014 much slower than early political statements implied. With most major firms signed up, practical delivery on the ground continues to lag a timeline many leaseholders hoped would be met sooner but latest information appears to indicate that the situation is now a priority issue and funding congestion is being speedily addressed. Hopefully this will be confirmed in next LST RNS.",

Initial projects have been carried out by LST's PFP Injectaclad division and roll-outs should be in hand. Big decisions and release of funding should be happening as we enter 2026. I suspect the next RNS will confirm those decisions (big companies move slowly but government pressure is there). Once those contracts are cemented then momentum should rapidly increase. Given that PFP work is very CapEx light, it should have a big effect on the bottom line. The other two divisions are also in similar positions regarding inflection points. Interesting year ahead.",

A lot has happened since then and that division has secured new contracts whilst also purposefully engaging with and targetting the defence sector (Nov RNS). The AgTech division has also been very active with substantial partnerships in a rapidly expanding field. The big news, I expect, will come from the PFP division. It has been commissioned by and has worked on 'initial' projects for two large real estate companies. These were due to complete in Q4 2025 and then roll-outs for Injectaclad would be considered for the wider estates. This could be the real elephant in the room given where we are at the moment. For my pennyworth: CEM flat but prospects on the increase from defence and onshoring due to global unrest;  AgTech gaining traction good outlook; PFP major rollouts at minimal Capex rapidly escalating profits. Will be interesting update when it arrives and I expect the outlook to be very good given global situation. This is an excellent UK small cap deserving of a rating which reflects it's pipeline, management and skillset.",

The only new Fire contracts announced in H2 2025 were the \u00a30.45m announced in August. Unless there were a lot of unannounced smaller contracts I think Fire revenue in H2 2025 could be substantially lower then the \u00a31.5m in H2 2024.
