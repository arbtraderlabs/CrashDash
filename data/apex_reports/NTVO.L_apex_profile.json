      "The crash signal labels the stock as a \u201cCRASH ZONE BOTTOM\u201d with a 92.8% drawdown, but the entry price of 0.00p means the bottom is essentially a zero\u2011price floor, not a tradable market bottom."

      "Zero ATR and zero 20\u2011day StdDev coupled with a 92.8% drawdown imply that the company has either ceased trading or has been stripped of tradable shares, which is often a prelude to a reverse takeover or a corporate restructuring."

      "A spike in search interest (despite zero absolute volume) can precede a relisting or reverse takeover \u2013 a situation where the market is poised to flip the company\u2019s status from dormant to active.",

A sudden, albeit low\u2011volume, rise in Google Trends search interest suggests an upcoming corporate event \u2013 possibly a reverse takeover or relisting \u2013 that could revive the ticker. However, liquidity, regulatory, and data integrity risks are extremely high, so any investment should be approached with caution and only after confirming a genuine corporate action."
