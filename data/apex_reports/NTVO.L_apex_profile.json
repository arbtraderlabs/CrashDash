      "The 92.8% drawdown paired with an entry price of 0.00p signals a catastrophic price collapse, yet Google Trends shows a 693% momentum spike, indicating a potential rebound that is not reflected in retail chatter.",
      "Zero ATR and 20\u2011day standard deviation suggest either a data gap or extreme illiquidity; the stock may be trading with negligible volume or could be suspended, creating a liquidity risk that can amplify price swings.",

    "hidden_patterns": [
      "A classic 'crash\u2011zone bottom' pattern: the price fell to near zero, but the Google trend surge shows that a small, possibly institutional, group is already betting on a rebound.",
      "Disparity between high momentum (+693%) and low overall interest (28/100) indicates a niche, high\u2011confidence crowd that may be orchestrating a short\u2011term rally rather than a sustainable recovery."

    "contrarian_signals": [
      "While most market metrics flag a bottom, the Google momentum suggests an upcoming upside; a contrarian trader might consider a long position once liquidity improves.",
