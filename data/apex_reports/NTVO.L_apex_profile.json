      "The crash signal flags a 92.8% drawdown from the all\u2011time high, yet the entry price is listed as 0.00p, which is inconsistent with any realistic price level and points to data corruption or a ticker that never traded above 1p."
    ],
    "hidden_patterns": [
      "The combination of a dead\u2011ticker classification with an upward Google Trends signal creates a paradoxical pattern: the market is technically dead, yet the algorithm interprets a sudden spike as bullish.",
      "Zero volatility metrics (ATR = 0, StdDev = 0) coupled with a high crash score imply that the price has been flat for an extended period, which is a classic sign of a suspended or delisted security rather than a normal trading asset."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [
      "While conventional analysis would dismiss the ticker as worthless, the sudden +1013% momentum could be an early warning of a relisting or a reverse\u2011split event that re\u2011introduces the stock at a new price level.",
      "The absence of social sentiment (0 posts) combined with a high crash score suggests that any future price movement is likely to be driven by institutional rather than retail activity."
    ],
    "risk_warnings": [
      "Liquidity risk: the security is effectively illiquid; any attempt to trade will likely be impossible or subject to extreme slippage.",
      "Regulatory risk: the ticker may have been suspended or delisted by the LSE AIM; any future trading could be subject to a freeze or forced sale.",
      "Data integrity risk: the contradictory entry price and crash signal indicate potential data errors in the source feeds."
    ],
    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If the company announces a restructuring, reverse\u2011split, or relisting, the stock could re\u2011enter trading at a price above 1p, creating a short\u2011term arbitrage window.",

    "narrative_summary": "NTVO.L appears to be a dormant or delisted AIM security with zero trading activity and no recent corporate disclosures. The anomalous Google Trends spike and crash signal are likely artefacts of data processing, not genuine market interest. The primary risk is liquidity and regulatory, but a potential catalyst such as a reverse\u2011split or relisting could create a contrarian trading opportunity if identified early."
