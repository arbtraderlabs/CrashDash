      "Zero ATR and 20\u2011day standard deviation confirm the stock is currently illiquid or halted, creating a liquidity risk that can amplify price swings or lock in positions.",
      "The crash\u2011zone bottom signal (92.8% drawdown, base score 9/21) combined with a 0.00p entry price indicates a data anomaly: the algorithm flagged a crash bottom but the market price has already collapsed to zero."
    ],
    "hidden_patterns": [
      "High retail FOMO signal juxtaposed with zero social media posts suggests retail attention is in the early hype stage, not yet translated into active discussion or trading.",
      "The absence of any recent RNS or catalysts, yet a strong search\u2011interest spike, implies a hidden catalyst (e.g., a pending regulatory filing, reverse split, or restructuring) that is not publicly disclosed."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [
      "Retail investors are clamoring (FOMO peak) while the stock shows no trading activity or official news \u2013 a situation that could trigger a short squeeze if the company relists or announces a reverse split.",
      "The crash\u2011bottom score is moderate (9/21), but the price is already at zero, which contradicts typical bottom\u2011price logic and may signal that the algorithm misinterprets a zero\u2011price event as a crash bottom."
    ],
    "risk_warnings": [
      "Illiquidity: zero ATR and StdDev mean no price discovery; any trade could be executed at a price far from market reality or may not execute at all.",
      "Data integrity: 0.00p entry price and zero volatility metrics raise the possibility of a reporting glitch or that the company has ceased trading entirely.",
      "No RNS or catalysts: absence of official communication increases the risk of unanticipated adverse events (e.g., delisting, insolvency)."
    ],
    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If the company is about to reverse\u2011split or relist, early entry at zero could yield a massive upside once trading resumes.",

    "narrative_summary": "NTVO.L is currently trading at zero with zero volatility, yet retail search interest has exploded, pointing to a looming corporate event that hasn\u2019t been disclosed. The illiquidity and data anomalies make the stock highly speculative, but if a reverse split or relisting occurs, the upside could be significant. Traders should monitor regulatory filings closely and be prepared for extreme price swings or a complete halt in trading."
