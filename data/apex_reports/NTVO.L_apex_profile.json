      "The crash signal (92.8% drawdown from peak) is likely a data artifact: the entry price is listed as 0.00p and ATR/StdDev are zero, indicating no recorded price activity.",
      "Google Trends shows a +420% momentum surge and a current interest score of 17/100, a stark contrast to the absence of any price movement or news filings.",
      "The absence of social posts and RNS announcements suggests either a complete lack of public engagement or a reporting gap, which is unusual for a listed AIM company.",
      "The combination of zero price data and rising search interest strongly hints at a pending corporate event (e.g., IPO, reverse takeover, or regulatory filing) that has not yet been reflected in market data.",
      "The lack of volatility metrics (ATR = 0, StdDev = 0) is a red flag for data integrity or a delisting scenario, rather than a genuine market stagnation."
    ],
    "hidden_patterns": [
      "Cross\u2011signal incongruence: positive momentum in search data versus null price/volatility signals indicates a data lag between public interest and trading activity.",
      "Temporal anomaly: the crash signal is flagged at the bottom of a crash zone while simultaneously Google Trends shows a build\u2011up, implying the price may have already hit an artificial floor before the surge in interest.",
      "Zero\u2011price anomaly: a 0.00p entry price coupled with a high crash score suggests the algorithm mis\u2011interpreted a zero\u2011share\u2011price event (e.g., a share suspension) as a crash."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [
      "Despite a reported 92.8% drawdown, search momentum is +420%; this contradiction suggests the stock may be poised for a rebound rather than continued decline."
    ],
    "risk_warnings": [
      "Data quality risk: the zero price and zero volatility metrics likely reflect a reporting glitch or a suspended trading status, not a true market condition.",
      "Fundamental risk: no RNS announcements or social chatter mean there is no publicly disclosed catalyst; the company may be in a liquidation or restructuring phase.",
      "Regulatory risk: a zero share price on the AIM often precedes a delisting or mandatory redemption, exposing investors to total loss if the company is wound up."
    ],
    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If the upcoming event (e.g., IPO or reverse takeover) materializes, the current price floor could provide a low entry point for contrarian investors.",
      "The surge in Google Trends indicates growing investor curiosity; early participation before the market fully reacts could capture upside."

    "narrative_summary": "NTVO.L displays a classic data\u2011inconsistency scenario: a reported 92.8% crash with zero price and volatility metrics contrasts sharply with a +420% build\u2011up in Google search interest and no public disclosures. This suggests a pending corporate event rather than a genuine market collapse, but data integrity and regulatory risks loom large. Investors should treat the stock as a high\u2011risk, high\u2011potential contrarian play pending confirmation of any forthcoming filings or price activity."
