These updates collectively improve the understanding of the Project's nickel sulphide potential and significantly refine the technical foundation for the next phase of exploration.\nThe data highlights a magmatic conduit system linking the Uitloop ultramafic bodies and defines multiple high-priority drill targets, several of which are supported by coincident gravity-magnetic-electromagnetic anomalies and remain untested. The presentation also outlines the Project's exploration strategy, geological interpretation updates, and the upcoming work programme designed to unlock further resource potential.\nCEO John Zorbas commented:\n\"\nWe are very pleased to release this updated presentation, which consolidates two years of geological and geophysical work into a comprehensive technical package. The integration of the airborne gravity, magnetic, and EM data materially enhances our understanding of the Zeb Nickel Project and highlights several compelling sulphide targets that have never been drill tested. These results position the Company to advance into the next phase of exploration with greatly increased confidence.\n\"\nURU Metals Limited\nJohn Zorbas\n(Chief Executive Officer)\n+1 416 504 3978\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nEwan Leggat / Jen Clarke\n+ 44 (0) 203 470 0470\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.
