This view is also shared by major publishers, as shown by CNN's decision in June to extend its relationship with Dianomi from CNN Business to the whole of CNN.

The Group operates from its offices in London, New York and Sydney. The Group enables premium brands to deliver advertisements to a targeted audience on the desktop and mobile websites, mobile and tablet applications of premium publishers. It provides premium advertisers, including blue chip names such as Charles Schwab, Invesco and Baillie Gifford, with access to an international audience of over 400 million devices per month through its partnerships with over 250 premium publishers, including blue chip names such as Reuters, CNN Business, the Times and WSJ. Adverts served are contextually relevant to the content of the webpages on which they appear and mirror the style of the page, which enhances reader engagement\n.\nChief Executive's Statement\nIntroduction\nThe first half of 2025 unfolded against a backdrop of cautious advertiser sentiment and macroeconomic volatility. Nonetheless, we continued to attract a growing number of leading new advertisers and publishers to our expanded full-service digital advertising platform, a clear testament to the appeal of our unique, premium offering. Alongside this, we have been investing significantly behind our global sales team, to broaden our advertiser base and into developing our product portfolio to extend our capabilities and offering. All whilst retaining a healthy cash position, leaving us well positioned to pursue growth opportunities as they arise and strengthen our operations.\nOperating Review\nAverage advertiser spend remained broadly stable at \u00a3113.1k (H1 2024: \u00a3117.7k) despite the tough market environment reflecting the underlying resilience of the business. We are also encouraged by the new business momentum we have seen, with over 40 new advertisers joining our platform in the period, up 59% year-on-year. Whilst the overall number of advertisers was down from 221 in the first half of 2024 to 197 in the current period, since the period end, we have welcomed back a number of previous advertisers and added over 20 new ones.\nOur publisher base decreased to 285 (H1 2024: 289), with mainly smaller publishers coming off the platform demonstrated by the publisher churn by revenue lost standing at only 2.8% (H1 2024: 4.6%). Furthermore, we continued to strengthen our base with a number of new tier-one relationships. During the period, we secured agreements with CNN News and AP News, both of which we have continued to scale in the second half of the year and present further opportunity for Dianomi. These partnerships underline Dianomi's ability to attract world-class media brands and extend the reach and quality of our network.\nWe also secured a new partnership with Microsoft Monetize, which gives us access to their network of over 500,000 advertisers across 170 countries. Subject to meeting our brand-safety standards, these advertisers are able to bid on our publisher inventory, which will increase advertiser access to our supply and further enhance our platform. The revenue being generated from this partnership is currently small but growing.\nOur programmatic capabilities allow advertisers to access our premium publisher network and the wider web through automated, data-driven buying, enabling greater scale, efficiency and precision in campaign delivery. Programmatic distribution increased during the period, with an Aramco campaign in Q1 targeting non-core countries, which drove programmatic supply revenue to \u00a3857k, a 310% increase on the previous period (H1 2024: \u00a3209k).\nIn the last two years, we have worked effectively to expand our offering from our historic native-only position to become a full-format digital advertising platform. This gives advertisers the ability to deliver contextual messaging that targets readers via a comprehensive suite of ad units.\nDianomi Audiences, being buyable audiences built using curated publisher lists, contextual keyword targeting, and Dianomi's 1st-party historical campaign data to optimize performance continue to be developed. Ad spend on our platform targeting contextual audiences using Dianomi Audiences continued to grow throughout the period.\nIn 2025 we introduced Dianomi Insights, an analytics tool designed to help brands view how their media coverage truly compares with industry peers; revealing not simply the number of articles published but more importantly how many readers the articles attracted. This new level of data has proved to be an effective marketing tool, and this year Dianomi Insights has published a series of industry reports. With the help of AI, we continue to work on enhancing our categorisation of publisher pages to provide deeper insights for our advertisers about their brands and the sectors they operate in.\nTo further invest behind our full-service offering, we have expanded our demand and supply teams, targeting a broader range of industry verticals beyond just business and finance. In the period, we welcomed two senior hires to the business; a Director of Luxury & Lifestyle Partnerships and a Global Head of Publisher Partnerships. We are confident that they will help drive our commitment to global collaboration across UK, US, and APAC regions.\nWe have also identified the affiliate advertising vertical as an area of opportunity. Historically this sector focused on paying publishers purely on a cost per sale basis, but with a recent expansion into cost per click advertising and focus on performance marketing, it has now become a natural opportunity for the Group. Dianomi has formed strong working relationships with leading players such as Rakuten and Awin and the first project in this market segment will be in the Gift space and will launch in October.\nMarket commentary\nOur market is not changing in terms of macroeconomics, but perhaps more prevalently we are seeing artificial intelligence (AI) influence, and perhaps even rewire, the habits of both consumers and suppliers. Readership levels across non-subscription publishers are being affected by the issue of \"zero click search\" results, meaning readers are opting to scan AI summaries on search engines, rather than click on and access full articles, which also impacted our impression levels which were down 16% compared to the same period last year. However, Dianomi is proving well placed to benefit from both publishers and advertisers who, in the face of falling traffic levels across non-subscription websites, are seeking the certainty of a premium platform, with a captive market and a transparent cost structure. Furthermore, native advertising often thrives in the early stages of any new platform, therefore we believe that there is an opportunity to work with AI platforms to help to monetise their content with targeted, contextual advertising and this is something being explored.\nInternally, Dianomi is exploring how AI can make our operations more efficient and help the business grow. The engineering team has developed a\nnew AI-driven bidder trained on years of Dianomi campaign click data forming our unique embeddings space. A cascade of deep neural network models is used to select the best ad and compute an optimal bid at the per-request level. This combination of our historical data with modern artificial intelligence techniques enables Dianomi to set competitive bids while honouring budget and pacing constraints.\nFurthermore, as referred to above, the team is also working on implementing an AI powered tool which is capable of delivering a much better categorisation of our publisher content pages which in turn will mean that ads can be targeted in a more efficient way and enable Dianomi to build more reliable insights for advertisers about their brands and the sectors they operate in.\nFinancial Review\nGroup revenue was\n\u00a3\n13.2 million\n(H1 2024: \u00a3\n14.2 million)\u00a0in the six months to\n30 June\n2025\nreflecting lower publisher traffic volumes, fewer advertisers using the platform (197 vs 221 in the six months to 30 June 2024) and FX headwinds due to the strengthening of the pound against the dollar in the period as c.80% of the Group's revenue is generated in the US. Revenue per click and CTR both increased compared to the prior period at \u00a30.53 and 0.119% (H1 2024: \u00a30.51 and 0.117%)\nGross\nmargin stood at 25.3%\n% (H1 2024: 26.2%) with the higher margin in the previous year\nreflecting the\nenhanced revenue share during the period arising from a contract amendment with one of the Group's largest publishers. Gross\nprofit for the period was therefore lower than H1 2024 at \u00a33.3 million (H1 2024: \u00a3\n3.7\nmillion) which, combined with the higher operating cost base of the Group following the decision to accelerate investment into the sales team, meant that the Group recognised a loss at Adjusted EBITDA* level of \u00a30.6 million compared to a profit of \u00a30.1 million in H1 2024.\nLoss before tax was \u00a30.7 million against a loss of \u00a30.1 million in H1 2024. There was a tax charge in the period of \u00a30.1 million relating to the Group's US subsidiary (H1 2024: tax credit of \u00a30.1 million). Loss after tax was \u00a30.8 million vs a loss after tax of \u00a30.1 million in H1 2024. Basic loss per share was 2.63 pence per share compared to a basic loss per share of 0.22 pence in H1 2024.\nCash used in operations was \u00a32.6 million (H1 2024: cash generated from operations of \u00a30.3 million) predominantly due to the decrease in trade and other payables of \u00a31.9 million due to payments to publishers who were late to invoice the Company in respect of balances owed relating to FY24 and the operating loss\n.\nA\ns at 30 June 2025 the Company had no borrowings and cash of \u00a35.7 million (31 December 2024: \u00a38.8 million,\n30 June 2024: \u00a38.1 million\n). As the Group holds the majority of its cash reserves in USD, cash was also impacted by\nadverse\nforeign exchange movements as a result of the strengthening of the pound against the dollar during the period (negative impact of \u00a30.4 million).\nNet assets as at 30 June 2025 amounted to \u00a37.3 million (31 December 2024: \u00a38.4 million, 30 June 2024: \u00a38.9 million).\nOutlook\nOur focus remains on serving the world's most premium brands and amplifying their content to targeted audiences. Trading patterns from the first half of the year continued over the summer with advertisers still remaining cautious given the uncertain economic backdrop, with revenue in July and August flat compared to 2024. However, September has seen new budgets from both new and existing advertisers coming on to the platform and the pipeline for the remainder of the year gives the Board confidence that the second half

PLC\nNOTES TO THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n1. General information\nDianomi plc (the \"Company\") and its subsidiaries' (together the \"Group\") principal activity is the delivery of premium native advertising for the financial services, technology, corporate sand lifestyle sectors. The Company was incorporated on 16 August 2002 in England and Wales as a private company limited by shares under the name Data-ID Limited. On 17 December 2002, the Company changed its name to Dianomi Limited. On 17 May 2021, the Company re-registered as a public limited company and changed its name to Dianomi plc.\nThe address of the registered office is 6th Floor, 60 Gracechurch Street, London, EC3V 0HR and the limited company number is 04513809.\n2.\nBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n2.1. Basis of preparation\nThe financial information relating to the half year ended 30 June 2025 is unaudited and does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information set out in this Interim Report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, prepared under IFRS, have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified and did not contain a statement under Section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as used in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, subject to the introduction of any new accounting standards applicable in the period.\nWhilst the financial information included in these interim accounts has been prepared in accordance with IFRS, they do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS. In addition, this report is not prepared in accordance with IAS 34.\nThis interim report was approved by the board of directors on 23 September 2025 and is available on the Company's website,\ndianomi.com\nThe presentational currency of these financial statements and the functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling.\n2.2. Measurement convention\nThe consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial information in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and management judgements in applying the accounting policies. The significant estimates and judgements that have been made and their effect is disclosed in note 3.\n2.3. Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial information incorporates the financial information of Dianomi Plc and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings include entities over which the Group has effective control. The Group controls a group when it is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns from its involvement with the Group and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the Group. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights.\n2.4. Going concern\nThe Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As at 30 June 2025 the Group had net assets of \u00a37.3 million (30 June 2024: \u00a38.9 million) and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a35.7 million (30 June 2024: \u00a38.1 million). The Group has no debt outstanding or facilities in place (30 June 2024: \u00a3nil).\nThe Group's forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group has sufficient working capital and available funds to honour all of its obligations to creditors as and when they fall due. Accordingly, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\n2.5.\nPrincipal Accounting Policies\n2.5.1.1. Revenue\nThe Group's customers are direct advertisers, affiliate advertisers and advertising agencies with whom the Group will enter into a contract or insertion order.\nThe Group generates revenue by charging advertisers for advertising campaigns delivered through its platform. The customer's total spend on advertising is determined by multiplying an agreed performance metric option, such as cost per mil (CPM), cost per impression (CPI), click (CPC) or action (CPA) with the volumes of units delivered.\nRevenue is recognised on completion of the performance criteria which, in most cases, is when an internet user clicks through to an advertisement that has been displayed on a web page.\nWhere advanced payments are made in advance of satisfying the performance obligation, these amounts are transferred to deferred revenue (contract liabilities) and recognised when the performance obligation has been met.\nThe Group's standard payment terms require settlement of invoices within 60-90 days of receipt.\nThe Group does not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money as it does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised services to the client and the payment by the client exceeds one year.\n.\n2.5.1.2. Cost of sales\nCost of sales represents the direct expenses that are attributable to the services sold. They consist primarily of payments to publishers under the terms of the revenue share agreements that the Group has with them. Depending on the terms of the revenue share agreements, cost of sales can include commissions where applicable.\n2.5.1.3.\nForeign currency translation\na) Function and presentational currency\nItems included in the financial information of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial information is presented in 'sterling', which is the Group's functional currency and the Group's presentation currency.\nOn consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income.\nb) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.\n2.5.1.4. Employee Benefits\nPost-retirement benefits\nThe Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Group has no further payment obligations.\nThe contributions are recognised as an expense in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Group in independently administered funds.\nShare based payments\nWhere share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to profit or loss over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each Statement of Financial Position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.\nThe fair value of the award also takes into account non-vesting conditions. These are either factors beyond the control of either party (such as a target based on an index) or factors which are within the control of one or other of the parties (such as the group keeping the scheme open or the employee maintaining any contributions required by the scheme).\nWhere the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to profit or loss over the remaining vesting period.\nWhere equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, profit or loss is charged with fair value of goods and services received.\n2.6. Alternative performance measures\nIn order to provide better clarity to the underlying performance of the Group, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are used as alternative performance measures. These measures are not defined under IFRS. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance, but have been included as the Directors consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share to be key measures used within the business for assessing the underlying performance of the Group's ongoing business across periods. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from operating profit non-cash depreciation and share based payment charges and non-recurring exceptional costs. Adjusted EPS excludes from profit after tax, share based payment charges and non-recurring exceptional items and their related tax impacts.\n3. Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial information requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and revenue in the consolidated financial information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.\nThe judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial information are:\nEstimations:\n-\nShare-based payments:\nthe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted and requires assumptions to be made in particular the value of the shares at the date of options granted. Management have had to apply judgement when selecting assumptions.\n-\nReceivables provision\n: the Group reviews the amount of credit loss associated with its trade receivables, intercompany receivables and other receivables based on historical default rates as well as forward looking estimates that consider current and forecast credit conditions.\nJudgements\n:\n-\nDeferred tax:\nthe extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilised. In addition, significant judgement is required in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties\n.\n-\nGoing concern:\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis based on a judgement by the Directors that the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 18 months from the date of signing these financial statements. In this context, the Directors have prepared detailed cash flow forecasts for the next 18 months that indicate the existing activities of the Group do not require additional funding during that period. The forecasts were challenged by various downside scenarios to stress test the estimated future cash position. The Directors note that the stress tests did not have a significant impact on the cash flow or cash position of the Group. In addition, current trading is in line with the forecast.\n4. Revenue\nRevenue arises from:\n6 months to\n30 Jun\n2025\n6 months to\n30 Jun\n2024\nYear to\n31 Dec\n2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nEMEA\n2,499\n2,664\n5,054\nAPAC\n444\n323\n857\nU.S.A.\n10,227\n11,197\n22,138\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\n13,169\n14,184\n28,049\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\n5. Operating segments\nThe Group is operated as one global business by its executive team, with key decisions being taken by the same leaders irrespective of the geography where work for clients is carried out. The Directors consider that the geographies where the Group operates have similar economic and operating characteristics and the products and services provided in each region are all related to premium native advertising\n.\nManagement therefore consider that the Group has one operating segment. The Group report is\u00a0presented and measured\u00a0to the Board as a single segment\u00a0and is consistent with the\u00a0financial\u00a0statements. As such, no additional disclosure has been recorded under IFRS.\n6. Earnings per share\nThe Group presents non-adjusted and adjusted basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted EPS takes into consideration the Company's dilutive contingently issuable shares. The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the diluted EPS calculation is inclusive of the number of share options that are expected to vest subject to performance criteria as appropriate, being met.\nThe (loss) / profit and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 25\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 24\nYear\nended\n31 Dec 2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n(Loss)/ profit attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Group used in calculating basic and diluted EPS\n(759)\n(66)\n419\nBasic (loss)/ profit per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n(0.22)\n1.40\nDiluted (loss)/ profit per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n(0.22)\n1.40\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 25\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 24\nYear\nended\n31 Dec 24\nAdjusted basic and diluted EPS\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nReconciliation of earnings used in calculating adjusted EPS:\nLoss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Group used in calculating basic and diluted EPS\n(759)\n(66)\n419\nAdjusting items:\nShare-based payments\n-\n153\n(737)\nTax impact of adjusting items\n-\n(15)\n-\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\n(Loss)/ profit attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Group used in calculating adjusted basic and diluted EPS\n(759)\n72\n(318)\nAdjusted basic (loss)/ earnings per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n0.24\n(1.06)\nAdjusted diluted (loss)/ earnings per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n0.23\n(1.06)\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 25\nSix months\nended\n30 Jun 24\nYear\nended\n31 Dec 24\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating non-adjusted and adjusted basic EPS\n30,027,971\n30,027,971\n30,027,971\nWeighted share option dilution impact\n-\n1,420,017\n-\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating non-adjusted and adjusted diluted EPS\n30,027,971\n31,447,988\n30,027,971\n7. Share based payments\nAt the time of the Company's IPO in May 2021, the Company introduced share option schemes (the \"IPO Option Schemes\") in order to retain, incentivise and align employees with shareholders. Under the IPO Option Schemes employees were granted share options with an exercise price equal to the IPO price (or for those granted post IPO equal to the then current share price), a vesting period of 3 years and a non-market performance condition.\nIn 2023, it became clear that the performance condition for those options granted at IPO was not going to be met and for those options granted in\n2022 under the same scheme it was unlikely to be met.\nTherefore, in November 2023 it was decided that employees who were granted options in 2021 and 2022 would be given the option to have their original options cancelled (the \"Cancellation\"), and replacement option schemes (the \"Replacement Option Schemes\") would be introduced under which employees would be issued with new options with a revised performance condition, exercise price and extended vesting period but at a lower number than those originally issued.\nDuring 2024, 43,034 options lapsed due to employees leaving the Group and of the total number of options outstanding at the end of 2024, nil had vested and were exercisable at the end of the year (31 Dec 23: Nil). As at 31 December 2024, it was considered unlikely that the performance criteria relating to the options in issue would be met, therefore share based payment charges recognised in previous years relating to these options have been reversed. No share-based payment charges have been recognised in the six months to 30 June 2025 as it is still considered unlikely that the performance criteria relating to the options in issue will be met.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to value the equity-settles share-based payment awards as it was considered that this approach would result in materially accurate estimate of the fair value of the options granted.\nThe inputs into the model for 2024 were as follows:\nOptions granted under IPO Option Schemes\nWeighted average share price at grant date (\u00a3)\n2.78\nWeighted average exercise price (\u00a3)\n2.78\nVolatility (%)\n44.00%\nWeighted average vesting period (years)\n3\nRisk free rate (%)\n3.482%\nExpected dividend yield (%)\n-\nOptions granted under Replacement Option Schemes\nWeighted average share price at grant date (\u00a3)\n48\nWeighted average exercise price (\u00a3)\n50\nVolatility (%)\n52.91%\nWeighted average vesting period (years)\n3\nRisk free rate (%)\n3.595%\nExpected dividend yield (%)\n-\nThe share-based remuneration (expense)/ credit comprises:\nAs at 30 Jun 2025\nAs at 30 Jun 2024\nAs at 31 Dec 2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nEquity-settled schemes\n-\n(153)\n737\n==========================================\n==========================================\n==========================================\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

That said, we continued to attract new, premium advertisers and publishers. Furthermore, behind our headline numbers, we have been investing in expanding the team, particularly our global sales function, launching new sector-targeted products and harnessing AI to drive operational efficiencies. These key and significant investments reflect our belief in the unique strengths of the Dianomi platform. No other digital ad company can offer the same premium collection of leading US financial mega-brands under one roof. This view is also shared by major publishers, as shown by CNN's decision in June to extend its relationship with Dianomi from CNN Business to the whole of CNN. While there is still work to do, we expect the benefit of the investments being made will start to come through in the current year and in full during 2026.\"\n* Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss or profit after tax before deducting net finance costs, tax, depreciation and share-based payment charges\n** Adjusted to exclude share-based payments\n.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.\nFor further information contact:\nDianomi\nRupert Hodson (Chief Executive Officer)\nCharlotte Stranner (Chief Financial Officer)\nTel: +44 (0)207 802 5530\nPanmure Liberum (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/ Freddy Crossley, Corporate Finance\nRupert Dearden, Corporate Broking\nTel: +44 (0)207 886 2500\nNovella Communications\nTim Robertson / Safia Colebrook\ndianomiplc@novella-comms.com\nTel: +44 (0)203 151 7008\nAbout Dianomi\nDianomi, established in 2003, is a leading provider of native digital advertising services to premium clients in the Business, Finance and Lifestyle sectors.

A key focus has been expanding our sales function to better capitalise on market opportunities. Our unique platform reaches 500 million predominantly affluent readers each month - a highly attractive audience for premium advertisers seeking performance at scale. We are continuing our transition from being a provider of pure native advertising formats into a comprehensive full-spectrum digital advertising platform to unlock greater value from our curated base of premium publishers and advertisers, built over the past twenty years. The start to 2025 has had its challenges due to macroeconomic headwinds but we have had some encouraging developments, with two significant new publisher wins and the signing of a deal with Microsoft Monetise to expand our addressable advertiser base. While the investments we are making will result in a near-term increase in our cost-base and a temporary impact on profitability, we are confident they will strengthen our market position, help to drive sustainable growth and deliver long-term returns for shareholders.\"\n[1]\nCalculated as profit after tax before charging interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the financial year, adjusted for share-based payment charges/credits, non-recurring income and costs relating to the 2023 reorganisation.

The potential to significantly improve from here is clear, principally through the conversion of our pipeline of significant new business opportunities. Alongside this, to augment the premium market positioning of our platform and to facilitate the demands of a wider client base, we continue to evolve from being a native ad platform to a full-format a",

During the period, new advertisers included PwC, the London Business School, Polen Capital and Northern Trust. However, some brands held back spending in the first half, leading to a lower number of advertisers on the platform compared to the same period last year. On the publisher side, the Group was pleased to expand its partnership with Dow Jones with the serving of Dianomi direct demand ads into display formats on the Wall Street Journal and other Dow Jones' properties to their audience of over 100 million monthly unique visitors. Shortly after the period end, Dianomi also signed a new agreement with a leading US financial news aggregator to test integrating bespoke format ads onto their site, which, if successful, could lead to a permanent integration. There is a further strong pipeline of publisher prospects which includes a host of premium brands and other US global publishing leaders with the potential to drive the Group's future growth. The US election in November also provides the potential for increased traffic and therefore monetisation opportunities.\nRevenue for the first six months of the year was at a similar level to the comparative period last year. Gross margin was impacted by the publisher mix during the period, with a greater proportion of revenue coming from lower margin publishers resulting in a gross margin of c. 26%. The successful cost reduction programme implemented in the prior year combined with a more stable market environment ensured the Group maintained the profitability it returned to in the second half of 2023, albeit at a lower level due to the decrease in gross margin.\nCash as at 30 June 2024 stood at \u00a38.1 million (31 December 2023: \u00a37.7 million).\nWhilst the pipeline of publisher prospects is as strong as it has ever been, the certainty and timing of converting these opportunities can vary. The business is reliant on closing new contracts with both publishers and advertisers to deliver its second half growth expectations. Reflecting the trend in publisher mix seen in H1, gross margin for the full year is expected to remain at a similar level for the second half of the year at circa. 26% which will impact profitability leading to lower EBITDA (2023: gross margin of 24.7% which was impacted by a one off cost associated with a publisher contract amendment).\nCEO of Dianomi, Rupert Hodson, commented\n: \"Following a challenging 2023, this year our markets have stabilised albeit a level of caution remains. That said, we are attracting the interest of leading global publisher brands and our new pipeline of prospects is extremely encouraging.\nI believe this reflects the growing demand from major publishers to secure privacy-first demand across both native and display, as they continue to future-proof their business in preparation for cookie deprecation and the loss of identity signals. Whether we can monetise this potential fully in 2024 remains to be seen but our longer-term market position is strong.\"\nChange of Name of Nominated Adviser\nThe Company announces that its Nominated Adviser and Broker has changed its name to Panmure Liberum Limited following completion of its corporate merger.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014.

Digital traffic across news publications over the course of the year reduced by between 10% to 30%. This naturally translated into lower revenues for the business which is reflected in the results we report today. It is important to highlight that demand from many of our advertisers was unchanged but lower traffic levels reduced our ability to monetise this demand. In response, during 2023 we focused on expanding our distribution channels, scaling up both new and existing publisher partnerships, and moving to become a full format advertising platform. These actions together with reducing our cost base by \u00a31m on an annualised basis and reorganising our management and sales teams means the Group is well placed to drive scale and profitability.\"\n* Calculated as profit after tax before charging interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the financial year, adjusted for share-based payments, non-recurring income and costs relating to the reorganisation. This metric provides a more comparable indication of the Group's core business performance by removing the impact of non-trading items that are reported separately.\n** Adjusted to exclude costs relating to the reorganisation, non-recurring income, the derecognition of the deferred tax asset and share-based payments.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014.

Profitability improved in the second half of the year as the Company benefitted both from the cost savings from the restructuring in the first half of the year and the enhanced revenue share resulting from a contract amendment with one of the Company's largest publishers, as announced in September 2023. Unaudited cash as at the 31 December 2023 was \u00a37.7 million (30 June 2023: \u00a37.1 million), demonstrating improved cash conversion in the second half of the year.\nAs previously reported, the decline in traffic volumes has been a key issue for publishers in 2023 and, despite the fact that demand from Dianomi's 400+ premium financial and lifestyle advertisers has remained consistent, the reduced traffic made fully monetising this demand more challenging. Looking ahead, we expect to add key new publishers, extend our programmatic distribution and potentially benefit from increased traffic during a US election year.\nThe Company expects to report full year audited results for the year to 31 December 2023 around mid-April 2023.\nRupert Hodson, CEO of Dianomi, said\n: \"Traffic levels across major publications were significantly down and this unsurprisingly impacted our business in 2023. That said, we enter 2024 in a good position. Backed by a well-capitalised balance sheet, we have an encouraging pipeline of prospective advertisers and publishers, combined with new product launches which are expected to make contributions over the next 12 months.\"\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit after tax before deducting net finance costs, tax, depreciation, exceptional items\nrelating to the restructuring\nand share based payment charges\nFor further information contact:\nDianomi\nRupert Hodson (Chief Executive Officer)\nCharlotte Stranner (Chief Financial Officer)\nTel: +44 (0)207 802 5530\nPanmure Gordon (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nEmma Earl/ Freddy Crossley, Corporate Finance\nRupert Dearden, Corporate Broking\nTel: +44 (0)207 886 2500\nNovella Communications\nTim Robertson\nClaire de Groot\nSafia Colebrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 151 7008\nAbout Dianomi\nDianomi, established in 2003, is a leading provider of native digital advertising services to premium clients in the Financial Services and Business sectors.

The Options granted at IPO under the IPO Option Plans were exercisable at the IPO price of \u00a32.73 after the later of the third anniversary of the date on which they were granted and the satisfaction of the applicable performance condition.\nAgainst a challenging market and macro-economic backdrop, Dianomi has underperformed financial forecasts for the previous and current financial year. To address the challenges it has faced, as previously announced, the Group has undertaken an organisational restructuring resulting in cost reductions and has focused its strategic initiatives to re-invigorate growth and profitability.\nThe Group's financial performance over the past and current year means the Options granted at IPO under the IPO Option Plans are unlikely to be exercised as the performance condition will not be met and strike prices are significantly above the Group's current share price.\nTherefore the Group's Remuneration Committee and Board were of the view that the IPO Option Plans did not meet the three principles of its remuneration strategy (the \"Remuneration Principles\"), namely; alignment with shareholders, and incentivisation and retention of employees and have therefore cancelled the Options granted at IPO under the IPO Option Plans (the \"Cancellation\") and introduced the New Option Plans.\nNew Option Plans\nConscious that the reason that the Remuneration Principles are not being met is due to the Group's financial performance, in introducing the New Option Plans, the Remuneration Committee has sought to introduce areas of compromise to promote alignment and protect shareholder dilution. These measures include a reduction in quantum of options granted to individuals, and a principle that until financial performance recovers to IPO levels, there is no reward to participants.\nTherefore, employees have been granted new Options under the New Option Plans representing 75% in number of the Options granted at IPO. Certain employees have been granted Options under the New Option Plans who did not previously hold Options under the IPO Option Plans. Prior to the Cancellation, the total number of Options in issue represented 5.5% of the issued share capital of the Company whereas the total Options in issue following the new Option grants represent 4.6%. Furthermore, under the New Option Schemes, the vesting period has been extended so that the new Options will vest in October 2026. Alongside the reduction to the number of Options granted and extension of the vesting period, the performance criteria have been amended as well as the exercise price which is 50 pence.\nCertain Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibilities (\"PDMRs\") have been granted Options under the New Option Schemes as follows:\nDirector/ PDMR\nRole\nNumber of Options Cancelled\nNumber of Options Granted\nCharlotte Stranner\nChief Financial Officer\n175,824\n131,868\nMichael Smith\nHead of Platform Engineering\n114,469\n85,852\nJulian Peterson\nManaging Director, APAC\n85,165\n63,874\nPaul Hughes\nHead of Product and Engineering\n91,575\n68,681\nMichael Kelly, Non-Executive Chairman of the Company, whose Options have been cancelled along with all Options granted at IPO, declined to be granted new Options under the New Option Plans and as such no longer holds any Options.\nRupert Hodson, Chief Executive Officer, has also not been granted Options under the New Option Plans and does not hold any Options.\nChair of Remuneration Committee and Non-Executive Chairman of Dianomi, Michael Kelly, commented\n: \"\nWhilst the business has been through a period of underperformance, we believe that the New Option Schemes strike the right balance between re-incentivising employees to drive shareholder value creation, whilst putting in place appropriately stretching performance criteria and other protections to ensure alignment with shareholders and mitigate the risk of rewarding underperformance. Our experienced leadership team and the wider talent base across the Group are the key to our success and it is therefore essential that we retain, motivate and strengthen the team over the next three years\n.\"\nNOTIFICATION AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTIONS BY PERSONS DISCHARGING MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERSONS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED ",

As has been widely reported, in the year to date, traffic volumes have been significantly lower across all media, such that the publisher minimum traffic levels in the six months to 30 June 2023 were not met, resulting in an overpayment by Dianomi to the publisher of $1 million (\"overpayment\") for the period which was due to be recouped in the second half of the year.\nFollowing discussions, the Company and the publisher have entered into an amendment to the Agreement (the \"Amendment\") whereby Dianomi has agreed not to recoup the overpayment, in return for which the publisher will provide Dianomi with an enhanced revenue share as from 1 July 2023 and, in addition to its existing permanent ad units, will provide Dianomi with additional premium ad inventory, including a new in-article unit. The Company will recognise the one-off overpayment as an additional cost of sale in H1.\nThe new ad inventory and enhanced revenue share will allow Dianomi to generate additional revenue and margin which is expected to at least offset the one-off additional cost of sale over the next 12 to 18 months.\nThe Amendment is expected to increase revenue and profitability in the second half of the current financial year and beyond. However, for the six months to 30 June 2023, it will result in a lower gross margin and an increased loss at adjusted EBITDA* level of \u00a31.0 million (loss of \u00a30.2 million before the Amendment). The Company expects to be profitable at an adjusted EBITDA* level in the second half of the current financial year.\nThere will be a short-term impact on cash of c.\u00a30.5 million in the current financial year which will unwind during 2024. Without the Amendment, the business is trading in line with the update the Company published on 17 July 2023 (\"Trading Update\") with revenue guidance for the full year 2023 currently remaining within the range included in the Trading Update.\nCEO of Dianomi, Rupert Hodson, commented\n: \"Whilst the revised contract will impact our earnings this year, we feel the enhanced potential for the remainder of this year and next year is a good trade-off and one that suits both parties, especially as we come into election year for the US. We are looking forward to demonstrating how well we can monetise the new in-article unit which is in high demand across our advertiser base.\"\nFor further information contact:\nDianomi\nRupert Hodson (Chief Executive Officer)\nCharlotte Stranner (Chief Financial Officer)\nTel: +44 (0)207 802 5530\nPanmure Gordon (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nEmma Earl/ Freddy Crossley, Corporate Finance\nRupert Dearden, Corporate Broking\nTel: +44 (0)207 886 2500\nNovella Communications\nTim Robertson\nClaire de Groot\nSafia Colebrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 151 7008\nAbout Dianomi\nDianomi, established in 2003, is a leading provider of native digital advertising services to premium clients in the Financial Services and Business sectors.

This trend is clear across Dianomi's direct publisher inventory with traffic levels across key publishers down by between 10-30% in the six months to 30 June 2023 vs the same period in 2022. As a consequence, while demand from Dianomi's 400+ premium financial and lifestyle advertisers has remained consistent with the backdrop announced at full year 2022 results, the reduced traffic across its publishers naturally impacts Dianomi's ability to generate revenue from the adverts it places on their digital properties. Furthermore, certain new publisher partnerships did not materialise in the expected timeframe to offset the decline in traffic across existing publishers, though they remain future opportunities.\nReadership levels are also perhaps finding a new 'normal' level post pandemic.\nReflecting these lower traffic levels, revenue for the six months to 30 June 2023 is expected to show a c.18% decrease on the same period in the previous year which benefitted from a strong Q1 before advertiser caution set in in Q2 2022. As a result, the Group expects revenue for the year ended 31 December 2023 to be lower than market expectations and is providing new revenue guidance of between \u00a330.5 and \u00a332.5 million (2022: \u00a335.9 million).\nImportantly, from a Company perspective, Dianomi continues to expand its distribution channels in order to generate increased and more predictable future income streams through:\n\u00b7\nFurther developing programmatic distribution, a key driver of future growth; and\n\u00b7\nContinuing to scale both existing and new publisher partnerships.\nDianomi's continues to develop its programmatic distribution capability with a 6 fold growth in programmatic revenue in the six months to 30 June 2023 compared to the same period last year, albeit from a relatively modest base. This provides opportunities for Dianomi to unlock further demand from its premium advertisers and scale the budgets they spend via the Company's trusted and brand safe platform. Alongside programmatic, scaling its core direct publisher inventory through expanding existing relationships and attracting new publishers remains a key priority for Dianomi.\nRetention of both publishers and advertisers has remained strong in 2023 and year to date the Company has continued to attract new publishers and advertisers to the platform providing the opportunity to scale these new relationships alongside converting new pipeline opportunities.\nThe operational cost base of the Group has been significantly improved following the restructuring of the Group's global management and sales teams in March, resulting in the cost base reducing by \u00a31 million on an annualised basis. Given the challenging market backdrop, the Group continues to carefully monitor its cost base whilst ensuring that sufficient investment is made to support future growth. Cash as at 30 June 2023 was \u00a37.1 million (31 December 2022: \u00a311.7 million), reflecting the unwinding of the working capital benefit highlighted at the time of the Company's final results for the year ended 31 December 2022, the delay in receipt of certain overdue debtor balances amounting to c. \u00a31.2 million (received shortly after the period end), one-off restructuring costs of \u00a30.8 million and foreign exchange movement as a result of the strengthening of the pound against the dollar during the period. The Company remains debt free and expects improved cash generation in the second half of the year.\nCEO of Dianomi, Rupert Hodson, commented\n: \"The fall in traffic levels will impact our business and the wider industry this year, nevertheless, it also serves to highlight the importance of developing our ability to scale distribution on a programmatic basis through the intelligent use of our deep understanding of context and engagement. As mentioned, we are continuing to attract new customers and expanding distribution through programmatic initiatives. We are therefore in a solid position with a strong balance sheet but as a business we are looking beyond the near term and focusing on our future ability to offer our existing customer base the option to substantially increase their spend with us.\"\nFor further information contact:\nDianomi\nRupert Hodson (Chief Executive Officer)\nCharlotte Stranner (Chief Financial Officer)\nTel: +44 (0)207 802 5530\nPanmure Gordon (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nEmma Earl/ Freddy Crossley, Corporate Finance\nRupert Dearden, Corporate Broking\nTel: +44 (0)207 886 2500\nNovella Communications\nTim Robertson\nClaire de Groot\nSafia Colebrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 151",

(FY21: 2.5%) and 2.8 per cent. (FY21: 4.1 per cent.) respectively\n\u00b7\nContinue to add new publishers to our client base with the number of publishers at year end standing at 336 (FY21: 326)\n\u00b7\nThis year, we counted Goldman Sachs, EY and Porsche amongst our new premium advertisers and the overall number of advertisers who used our platform during the year stood at 387 (FY21: 427)\n\u00b7\nOur client focus remains the premium segment of the Business and Finance sector where our client base today includes all of the top 10 asset management companies in the US, 7 of the top ten largest wealth management firms in the US and 5 of the top 10 largest US banks\n\u00b7\nWe continued to roll out our new partnership with CNN Business as its exclusive content recommendation partner and CNN is now our second largest publisher with further integration and potential for growth to be completed in 2023\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully developing our programmatic offering with positive trials with the likes of Morgan Stanley and Porsche leading to material uplift in programmatic sales to stand at \u00a31.2 million this year (2021: \u00a30.2 million)\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nAs the contextual native advertising partner of choice in the business and finance sectors, we are in an optimal position to benefit from a return of confidence amongst advertisers as well as new opportunities with publishers\n\u00b7\nContinued development and expansion of our programmatic offering to a larger number of publishers across the platform over the course of the year\n\u00b7\nStrong balance sheet positioning the Company well for growth, and cost base aligned with current unpredictable environment and uncertain levels of spend in order to protect profitability\n\u00b7\nCurrent year has started in line with management expectations\nRupert Hodson, CEO of Dianomi commented:\n\"\n2022 started well for Dianomi and growth in revenues in the first half was solid. However, the macro-economic backdrop proved more challenging as we moved into the second half of the year and the advertising sector was not immune to this. Given a tougher than expected environment, I am encouraged to see that the Dianomi platform remains as relevant and robust as ever. Client retention remains one of our key strengths and we have also added some very impressive premium names to our advertiser and publisher base. Our programmatic trials have gone well and we look forward to rolling this out to a broader client base.\n2023 has started well and in line with management expectations. As we move through the year, we believe that we are well placed to capitalise on a return of confidence amongst advertisers. We are entering a new chapter for Dianomi given recent management changes which has led to new talent joining the Company providing fresh impetus across the business. Our pipeline of new prospects is good and we continue to enjoy a strong balance sheet which underpins our ability to invest in strategic opportunities as they arise.\"\n* Calculated as profit after tax before charging interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the financial year, adjusted for share-based payments, other, non-recurring income and costs which were IPO related.

Unaudited cash as at the 31 December 2022 was \u00a311.6 million (30 June 2022: \u00a310.4 million), demonstrating high levels of cash conversion.\nThe Company expects to report full year results for the year to 31 December 2022 around mid-April 2023.\nDianomi has entered 2023 with a strong pipeline of publishers looking to join or extend and expand their presence on Dianomi's contextual platform. A high publisher and advertiser retention rate has long been a key business strength, with publishers and advertisers choosing Dianomi's platform for its ability to deliver attractive returns combined with high quality content from global business and lifestyle brands.\nHowever, a recent report from e-Marketer suggested that publishers' advertising businesses are having a difficult start to the year, though indications of Q2 budgets are looking more positive. Furthermore, due to the challenging macro-economic environment, market forecasts for overall digital ad spending have been reduced to show modest levels of growth for this year. Whilst Dianomi is confident that the quality of its offering will continue to attract publishers and advertisers alike, due to the cautious market outlook, in order to maintain profit margins, the Company is ensuring that its cost base is appropriate for an unpredictable trading environment.\nRupert Hodson, Chief Executive Officer of Dianomi, said\n:\n\"We have an impressive core of existing publishers and advertisers who continue to trust us and work with us, resulting in a low churn rate. There is some understandable caution amongst advertisers relating to the general economic environment, and so we are ensuring that the Company is well-placed to adapt to uncertain levels of spend whilst continuing to expand and develop our offering.\"\n* adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit after tax before deducting net finance costs, tax, depreciation and share based payment charges\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014.

Goldman Sachs, Porsche and Ameriprise all became advertisers this year on the Dianomi ad platform. Distribution of ads continues to be supported by the Group's deep partnerships with premium publishers throughout the world. Dianomi currently works with 387 premium publishers, including those accessed programmatically.\nThe average spend for the top 100 advertisers is at similar levels to 2021, despite newsletter spend decreasing significantly as highlighted in the results for the six months to 30 June 2022. New advertiser spend in the second half of the year has not grown as anticipated, with the changes to the economic and political landscape over the course of 2022 creating a general global slowdown. While revenues are expected to be in line with 2021 levels, the decrease in gross margin as previously announced on 21 September 2022, alongside the Group's investment in developing the talent base of the business to support future growth, means that Adjusted EBITDA* for the year to 31 December 2022 is expected to be lower than consensus market expectations at approximately half of that for the prior year. Unaudited cash at 30 November remains strong at \u00a310.8 million.\nThe strength of the Dianomi proposition for both advertisers and publishers remains unchanged. The investment made in new talent which has expanded the Company's sales and engineering capabilities is key to the roll-out of Dianomi's contextually-led programmatically enabled platform, and an important driver for future growth. The platform has been trialled by Porsche and Morgan Stanley, initial results from both have been positive and programmatic revenues are expected to build in 2023.\nMacroeconomic headwinds and privacy legislation have caused short-term industry digital ad spending forecasts to be lowered from those published in March. However, total US digital ad spend is still forecast to grow in 2023 and beyond and, furthermore, privacy changes including the deprecation of cookies are set to benefit the Group given Dianomi's premium positioning, the quality of its inventory, the transparency of performance and its contextual platform.\nRupert Hodson, Chief Executive Officer of Dianomi, said\n:\n\"The Group remains well placed for future growth, with strong cash generation and a robust balance sheet. Though we are disappointed that the growth originally forecast for this year has not materialised, we are encouraged by the stickiness of both our advertiser and publisher base and the new names which have joined our platform this year. The market environment is challenging, but we are confident that the quality of our platform as well as its contextual nature will prove to be an advantage in light of the expected changes in privacy legislation. Furthermore, the roll-out of our programmatic capabilities provides further opportunity for growth next year and beyond. Alongside this, our investment in talent is for the long-term. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, digital advertising remains a growth sector, Dianomi is a leader in its chosen markets, and we are very focused on further expanding our share.\"\n* Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit after tax before deducting net finance costs, tax, depreciation, exceptional items and share based payment charges\n** Source: eMarketer December 2022\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014.

          "full_content": "18 Jul 2022 07:00\nRNS Number : 7252S\nDianomi PLC\n18 July 2022\n18\nJuly 2022\nDianomi plc\n(\"Dianomi\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nTrading Update\nEncouraging H1 performance. Strong pipeline of opportunities with revenues for the full year expected to be broadly in line with market expectations.\nDianomi,\na leading provider of native digital advertising services to premium clients in the Business, Finance and Lifestyle sectors, is pleased to announce the following trading update for the first six months to 30 June 2022.\nThe Group has delivered a good first half, with revenues expected to be up 4% against a particularly strong comparative period last year, despite a negative macro environment.\nBoth the advertiser and publisher base have expanded so far in 2022, including the successful rollout of the contract with CNN Business, which, even though it is yet to be fully implemented, is already a top 5 publisher.\nWhilst it is too early to determine with certainty, the Company still currently expects revenues for the full year to be broadly in line with market expectations.\nThere are significant prospective publisher contracts being pursued, representing a solid pipeline of new business. The business is reliant on closing new contracts in the pipeline within expected timeframes to deliver its second half growth expectations, and whilst the timing to convert these opportunities varies, there are several opportunities being pursued which provides confidence in the outlook.\nIn Q2, some advertisers spent more cautiously; however, historical patterns consistently show trading to be weighted to the second half of the year for both native and video campaigns, although there remains a risk that weaker advertising spend persists. Trials are underway amongst new advertisers across contextual and programmatic channels. Whilst the programmatic platform is nascent, early results are encouraging and it is expected that increased revenue will be generated through this solution in the second half of the year. Video campaigns represent another growth area which generates ad hoc income but can be significant, and a number of conversations with key advertisers with video demand are ongoing.\nThe Group made investments in FY21 and in the first half of year to support future growth, including the roll-out of Dianomi's contextually-led programmatic platform. These investments were predominantly in marketing and people, including a new Head of Programmatic. However, these investments as well as the additional costs associated with being a public company, have contributed to a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA* margin from 10% for the six months to June 2021 to approximately 5% for the six months to 30 June 2022. Adjusted EBITDA* margin is expected to improve in the second half of the year. Unaudited cash at 30 June 2022 was \u00a310.4 million.\nRupert Hodson, Chief Executive Officer of Dianomi, said\n:\n\"Given our significant growth in 2020 and 2021 and the uncertain macro environment, we are encouraged by the Group's performance in the first half of the year.\n\"With the investments made in future growth, as well as healthy pipelines and historical track record, Dianomi is well placed going into the second half of the year, and we are optimistic for a solid result for the year. In the medium term, the market opportunities for the Group are expanding significantly,\nas the advertising world adjusts to a cookie-less environment and increasing numbers of potential clients reassess the power and accuracy of contextual solutions.\"\n* Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit after tax before deducting net finance costs, tax, depreciation, exceptional items and share based payment charges\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014.
