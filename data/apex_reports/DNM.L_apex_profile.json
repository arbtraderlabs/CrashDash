These key and significant investments reflect our belief in the unique strengths of the Dianomi platform.

This view is also shared by major publishers, as shown by CNN's decision in June to extend its relationship with Dianomi from CNN Business to the whole of CNN.

The Group operates from its offices in London, New York and Sydney. The Group enables premium brands to deliver advertisements to a targeted audience on the desktop and mobile websites, mobile and tablet applications of premium publishers. It provides premium advertisers, including blue chip names such as Charles Schwab, Invesco and Baillie Gifford, with access to an international audience of over 400 million devices per month through its partnerships with over 250 premium publishers, including blue chip names such as Reuters, CNN Business, the Times and WSJ. Adverts served are contextually relevant to the content of the webpages on which they appear and mirror the style of the page, which enhances reader engagement\n.\nChief Executive's Statement\nIntroduction\nThe first half of 2025 unfolded against a backdrop of cautious advertiser sentiment and macroeconomic volatility. Nonetheless, we continued to attract a growing number of leading new advertisers and publishers to our expanded full-service digital advertising platform, a clear testament to the appeal of our unique, premium offering. Alongside this, we have been investing significantly behind our global sales team, to broaden our advertiser base and into developing our product portfolio to extend our capabilities and offering. All whilst retaining a healthy cash position, leaving us well positioned to pursue growth opportunities as they arise and strengthen our operations.\nOperating Review\nAverage advertiser spend remained broadly stable at \u00a3113.1k (H1 2024: \u00a3117.7k) despite the tough market environment reflecting the underlying resilience of the business. We are also encouraged by the new business momentum we have seen, with over 40 new advertisers joining our platform in the period, up 59% year-on-year. Whilst the overall number of advertisers was down from 221 in the first half of 2024 to 197 in the current period, since the period end, we have welcomed back a number of previous advertisers and added over 20 new ones.\nOur publisher base decreased to 285 (H1 2024: 289), with mainly smaller publishers coming off the platform demonstrated by the publisher churn by revenue lost standing at only 2.8% (H1 2024: 4.6%). Furthermore, we continued to strengthen our base with a number of new tier-one relationships. During the period, we secured agreements with CNN News and AP News, both of which we have continued to scale in the second half of the year and present further opportunity for Dianomi. These partnerships underline Dianomi's ability to attract world-class media brands and extend the reach and quality of our network.\nWe also secured a new partnership with Microsoft Monetize, which gives us access to their network of over 500,000 advertisers across 170 countries. Subject to meeting our brand-safety standards, these advertisers are able to bid on our publisher inventory, which will increase advertiser access to our supply and further enhance our platform. The revenue being generated from this partnership is currently small but growing.\nOur programmatic capabilities allow advertisers to access our premium publisher network and the wider web through automated, data-driven buying, enabling greater scale, efficiency and precision in campaign delivery. Programmatic distribution increased during the period, with an Aramco campaign in Q1 targeting non-core countries, which drove programmatic supply revenue to \u00a3857k, a 310% increase on the previous period (H1 2024: \u00a3209k).\nIn the last two years, we have worked effectively to expand our offering from our historic native-only position to become a full-format digital advertising platform. This gives advertisers the ability to deliver contextual messaging that targets readers via a comprehensive suite of ad units.\nDianomi Audiences, being buyable audiences built using curated publisher lists, contextual keyword targeting, and Dianomi's 1st-party historical campaign data to optimize performance continue to be developed. Ad spend on our platform targeting contextual audiences using Dianomi Audiences continued to grow throughout the period.\nIn 2025 we introduced Dianomi Insights, an analytics tool designed to help brands view how their media coverage truly compares with industry peers; revealing not simply the number of articles published but more importantly how many readers the articles attracted. This new level of data has proved to be an effective marketing tool, and this year Dianomi Insights has published a series of industry reports. With the help of AI, we continue to work on enhancing our categorisation of publisher pages to provide deeper insights for our advertisers about their brands and the sectors they operate in.\nTo further invest behind our full-service offering, we have expanded our demand and supply teams, targeting a broader range of industry verticals beyond just business and finance. In the period, we welcomed two senior hires to the business; a Director of Luxury & Lifestyle Partnerships and a Global Head of Publisher Partnerships. We are confident that they will help drive our commitment to global collaboration across UK, US, and APAC regions.\nWe have also identified the affiliate advertising vertical as an area of opportunity. Historically this sector focused on paying publishers purely on a cost per sale basis, but with a recent expansion into cost per click advertising and focus on performance marketing, it has now become a natural opportunity for the Group. Dianomi has formed strong working relationships with leading players such as Rakuten and Awin and the first project in this market segment will be in the Gift space and will launch in October.\nMarket commentary\nOur market is not changing in terms of macroeconomics, but perhaps more prevalently we are seeing artificial intelligence (AI) influence, and perhaps even rewire, the habits of both consumers and suppliers. Readership levels across non-subscription publishers are being affected by the issue of \"zero click search\" results, meaning readers are opting to scan AI summaries on search engines, rather than click on and access full articles, which also impacted our impression levels which were down 16% compared to the same period last year. However, Dianomi is proving well placed to benefit from both publishers and advertisers who, in the face of falling traffic levels across non-subscription websites, are seeking the certainty of a premium platform, with a captive market and a transparent cost structure. Furthermore, native advertising often thrives in the early stages of any new platform, therefore we believe that there is an opportunity to work with AI platforms to help to monetise their content with targeted, contextual advertising and this is something being explored.\nInternally, Dianomi is exploring how AI can make our operations more efficient and help the business grow. The engineering team has developed a\nnew AI-driven bidder trained on years of Dianomi campaign click data forming our unique embeddings space. A cascade of deep neural network models is used to select the best ad and compute an optimal bid at the per-request level. This combination of our historical data with modern artificial intelligence techniques enables Dianomi to set competitive bids while honouring budget and pacing constraints.\nFurthermore, as referred to above, the team is also working on implementing an AI powered tool which is capable of delivering a much better categorisation of our publisher content pages which in turn will mean that ads can be targeted in a more efficient way and enable Dianomi to build more reliable insights for advertisers about their brands and the sectors they operate in.\nFinancial Review\nGroup revenue was\n\u00a3\n13.2 million\n(H1 2024: \u00a3\n14.2 million)\u00a0in the six months to\n30 June\n2025\nreflecting lower publisher traffic volumes, fewer advertisers using the platform (197 vs 221 in the six months to 30 June 2024) and FX headwinds due to the strengthening of the pound against the dollar in the period as c.80% of the Group's revenue is generated in the US. Revenue per click and CTR both increased compared to the prior period at \u00a30.53 and 0.119% (H1 2024: \u00a30.51 and 0.117%)\nGross\nmargin stood at 25.3%\n% (H1 2024: 26.2%) with the higher margin in the previous year\nreflecting the\nenhanced revenue share during the period arising from a contract amendment with one of the Group's largest publishers. Gross\nprofit for the period was therefore lower than H1 2024 at \u00a33.3 million (H1 2024: \u00a3\n3.7\nmillion) which, combined with the higher operating cost base of the Group following the decision to accelerate investment into the sales team, meant that the Group recognised a loss at Adjusted EBITDA* level of \u00a30.6 million compared to a profit of \u00a30.1 million in H1 2024.\nLoss before tax was \u00a30.7 million against a loss of \u00a30.1 million in H1 2024. There was a tax charge in the period of \u00a30.1 million relating to the Group's US subsidiary (H1 2024: tax credit of \u00a30.1 million). Loss after tax was \u00a30.8 million vs a loss after tax of \u00a30.1 million in H1 2024. Basic loss per share was 2.63 pence per share compared to a basic loss per share of 0.22 pence in H1 2024.\nCash used in operations was \u00a32.6 million (H1 2024: cash generated from operations of \u00a30.3 million) predominantly due to the decrease in trade and other payables of \u00a31.9 million due to payments to publishers who were late to invoice the Company in respect of balances owed relating to FY24 and the operating loss\n.\nA\ns at 30 June 2025 the Company had no borrowings and cash of \u00a35.7 million (31 December 2024: \u00a38.8 million,\n30 June 2024: \u00a38.1 million\n). As the Group holds the majority of its cash reserves in USD, cash was also impacted by\nadverse\nforeign exchange movements as a result of the strengthening of the pound against the dollar during the period (negative impact of \u00a30.4 million).\nNet assets as at 30 June 2025 amounted to \u00a37.3 million (31 December 2024: \u00a38.4 million, 30 June 2024: \u00a38.9 million).\nOutlook\nOur focus remains on serving the world's most premium brands and amplifying their content to targeted audiences. Trading patterns from the first half of the year continued over the summer with advertisers still remaining cautious given the uncertain economic backdrop, with revenue in July and August flat compared to 2024. However, September has seen new budgets from both new and existing advertisers coming on to the platform and the pipeline for the remainder of the year gives the Board confidence that the second half of the year will see growth vs the first half with a return to profitability in Q4.\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as profit after tax before deducting net finance costs, tax, depreciation and

PLC\nNOTES TO THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n1. General information\nDianomi plc (the \"Company\") and its subsidiaries' (together the \"Group\") principal activity is the delivery of premium native advertising for the financial services, technology, corporate sand lifestyle sectors. The Company was incorporated on 16 August 2002 in England and Wales as a private company limited by shares under the name Data-ID Limited. On 17 December 2002, the Company changed its name to Dianomi Limited. On 17 May 2021, the Company re-registered as a public limited company and changed its name to Dianomi plc.\nThe address of the registered office is 6th Floor, 60 Gracechurch Street, London, EC3V 0HR and the limited company number is 04513809.\n2.\nBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n2.1. Basis of preparation\nThe financial information relating to the half year ended 30 June 2025 is unaudited and does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe financial information set out in this Interim Report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, prepared under IFRS, have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified and did not contain a statement under Section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as used in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, subject to the introduction of any new accounting standards applicable in the period.\nWhilst the financial information included in these interim accounts has been prepared in accordance with IFRS, they do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS. In addition, this report is not prepared in accordance with IAS 34.\nThis interim report was approved by the board of directors on 23 September 2025 and is available on the Company's website,\ndianomi.com\nThe presentational currency of these financial statements and the functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling.\n2.2. Measurement convention\nThe consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial information in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and management judgements in applying the accounting policies. The significant estimates and judgements that have been made and their effect is disclosed in note 3.\n2.3. Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial information incorporates the financial information of Dianomi Plc and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings include entities over which the Group has effective control. The Group controls a group when it is exposed to, or has right to, variable returns from its involvement with the Group and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the Group. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights.\n2.4. Going concern\nThe Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. As at 30 June 2025 the Group had net assets of \u00a37.3 million (30 June 2024: \u00a38.9 million) and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a35.7 million (30 June 2024: \u00a38.1 million). The Group has no debt outstanding or facilities in place (30 June 2024: \u00a3nil).\nThe Group's forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group has sufficient working capital and available funds to honour all of its obligations to creditors as and when they fall due. Accordingly, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\n2.5.\nPrincipal Accounting Policies\n2.5.1.1. Revenue\nThe Group's customers are direct advertisers, affiliate advertisers and advertising agencies with whom the Group will enter into a contract or insertion order.\nThe Group generates revenue by charging advertisers for advertising campaigns delivered through its platform. The customer's total spend on advertising is determined by multiplying an agreed performance metric option, such as cost per mil (CPM), cost per impression (CPI), click (CPC) or action (CPA) with the volumes of units delivered.\nRevenue is recognised on completion of the performance criteria which, in most cases, is when an internet user clicks through to an advertisement that has been displayed on a web page.\nWhere advanced payments are made in advance of satisfying the performance obligation, these amounts are transferred to deferred revenue (contract liabilities) and recognised when the performance obligation has been met.\nThe Group's standard payment terms require settlement of invoices within 60-90 days of receipt.\nThe Group does not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money as it does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised services to the client and the payment by the client exceeds one year.\n.\n2.5.1.2. Cost of sales\nCost of sales represents the direct expenses that are attributable to the services sold. They consist primarily of payments to publishers under the terms of the revenue share agreements that the Group has with them. Depending on the terms of the revenue share agreements, cost of sales can include commissions where applicable.\n2.5.1.3.\nForeign currency translation\na) Function and presentational currency\nItems included in the financial information of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial information is presented in 'sterling', which is the Group's functional currency and the Group's presentation currency.\nOn consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income.\nb) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.\n2.5.1.4. Employee Benefits\nPost-retirement benefits\nThe Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Group has no further payment obligations.\nThe contributions are recognised as an expense in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Group in independently administered funds.\nShare based payments\nWhere share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to profit or loss over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each Statement of Financial Position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.\nThe fair value of the award also takes into account non-vesting conditions. These are either factors beyond the control of either party (such as a target based on an index) or factors which are within the control of one or other of the parties (such as the group keeping the scheme open or the employee maintaining any contributions required by the scheme).\nWhere the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to profit or loss over the remaining vesting period.\nWhere equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, profit or loss is charged with fair value of goods and services received.\n2.6. Alternative performance measures\nIn order to provide better clarity to the underlying performance of the Group, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are used as alternative performance measures. These measures are not defined under IFRS. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance, but have been included as the Directors consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share to be key measures used within the business for assessing the underlying performance of the Group's ongoing business across periods. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from operating profit non-cash depreciation and share based payment charges and non-recurring exceptional costs. Adjusted EPS excludes from profit after tax, share based payment charges and non-recurring exceptional items and their related tax impacts.\n3. Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial information requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and revenue in the consolidated financial information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.\nThe judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial information are:\nEstimations:\n-\nShare-based payments:\nthe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted and requires assumptions to be made in particular the value of the shares at the date of options granted. Management have had to apply judgement when selecting assumptions.\n-\nReceivables provision\n: the Group reviews the amount of credit loss associated with its trade receivables, intercompany receivables and other receivables based on historical default rates as well as forward looking estimates that consider current and forecast credit conditions.\nJudgements\n:\n-\nDeferred tax:\nthe extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilised. In addition, significant judgement is required in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties\n.\n-\nGoing concern:\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis based on a judgement by the Directors that the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 18 months from the date of signing these financial statements. In this context, the Directors have prepared detailed cash flow forecasts for the next 18 months that indicate the existing activities of the Group do not require additional funding during that period. The forecasts were challenged by various downside scenarios to stress test the estimated future cash position. The Directors note that the stress tests did not have a significant impact on the cash flow or cash position of the Group. In addition, current trading is in line with the forecast.\n4. Revenue\nRevenue arises from:\n6 months to\n30 Jun\n2025\n6 months to\n30 Jun\n2024\nYear to\n31 Dec\n2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nEMEA\n2,499\n2,664\n5,054\nAPAC\n444\n323\n857\nU.S.A.\n10,227\n11,197\n22,138\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\n13,169\n14,184\n28,049\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\n5. Operating segments\nThe Group is operated as one global business by its executive team, with key decisions being taken by the same leaders irrespective of the geography where work for clients is carried out. The Directors consider that the geographies where the Group operates have similar economic and operating characteristics and the products and services provided in each region are all related to premium native advertising\n.\nManagement therefore consider that the Group has one operating segment. The Group report is\u00a0presented and measured\u00a0to the Board as a single segment\u00a0and is consistent with the\u00a0financial\u00a0statements. As such, no additional disclosure has been recorded under IFRS.\n6. Earnings per share\nThe Group presents non-adjusted and adjusted basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted EPS takes into consideration the Company's dilutive contingently issuable shares. The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the diluted EPS calculation is inclusive of the number of share options that are expected to vest subject to performance criteria as appropriate, being met.\nThe (loss) / profit and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 25\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 24\nYear\nended\n31 Dec 2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n(Loss)/ profit attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Group used in calculating basic and diluted EPS\n(759)\n(66)\n419\nBasic (loss)/ profit per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n(0.22)\n1.40\nDiluted (loss)/ profit per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n(0.22)\n1.40\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 25\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 24\nYear\nended\n31 Dec 24\nAdjusted basic and diluted EPS\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nReconciliation of earnings used in calculating adjusted EPS:\nLoss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Group used in calculating basic and diluted EPS\n(759)\n(66)\n419\nAdjusting items:\nShare-based payments\n-\n153\n(737)\nTax impact of adjusting items\n-\n(15)\n-\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\n(Loss)/ profit attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Group used in calculating adjusted basic and diluted EPS\n(759)\n72\n(318)\nAdjusted basic (loss)/ earnings per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n0.24\n(1.06)\nAdjusted diluted (loss)/ earnings per ordinary share (p)\n(2.63)\n0.23\n(1.06)\nSix months ended\n30 Jun 25\nSix months\nended\n30 Jun 24\nYear\nended\n31 Dec 24\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating non-adjusted and adjusted basic EPS\n30,027,971\n30,027,971\n30,027,971\nWeighted share option dilution impact\n-\n1,420,017\n-\n======================================================\n======================================================\n======================================================\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in calculating non-adjusted and adjusted diluted EPS\n30,027,971\n31,447,988\n30,027,971\n7. Share based payments\nAt the time of the Company's IPO in May 2021, the Company introduced share option schemes (the \"IPO Option Schemes\") in order to retain, incentivise and align employees with shareholders. Under the IPO Option Schemes employees were granted share options with an exercise price equal to the IPO price (or for those granted post IPO equal to the then current share price), a vesting period of 3 years and a non-market performance condition.\nIn 2023, it became clear that the performance condition for those options granted at IPO was not going to be met and for those options granted in\n2022 under the same scheme it was unlikely to be met.\nTherefore, in November 2023 it was decided that employees who were granted options in 2021 and 2022 would be given the option to have their original options cancelled (the \"Cancellation\"), and replacement option schemes (the \"Replacement Option Schemes\") would be introduced under which employees would be issued with new options with a revised performance condition, exercise price and extended vesting period but at a lower number than those originally issued.\nDuring 2024, 43,034 options lapsed due to employees leaving the Group and of the total number of options outstanding at the end of 2024, nil had vested and were exercisable at the end of the year (31 Dec 23: Nil). As at 31 December 2024, it was considered unlikely that the performance criteria relating to the options in issue would be met, therefore share based payment charges recognised in previous years relating to these options have been reversed.
