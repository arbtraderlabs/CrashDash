This has been achieved despite trading conditions remaining challenging.\nAt the same time, as macroeconomic uncertainty has continued this has impacted certain project completions in some business lines, most noticeably in our integrated consumer marketing agencies. Pipelines remain strong and growing, but completions of certain major projects have carried over from H2 2025 into H1 2026, which has impacted FY2025 revenues. As a consequence, we expect FY2025 revenues to be \u00a368.0m and headline operating profit to be \u00a35.1m, below market expectations1.\nOur balance sheet improved over the year, with net bank debt on 31 December 2025 at \u00a39.0m (31 December 2024: \u00a39.5m). Total debt including outstanding acquisition liabilities at 31 December 2025 is \u00a310.3m, a substantial reduction and improvement on the 31 December 2024 balance of \u00a314.2m following strong cash conversion.\nPlan for future strategic success\nFollowing the appointment of John Carey as Chief Executive in September 2025, the Board has undertaken a review of the Group's strategy to position the Company for its next chapter of growth and achieve a positive net cash position.\nAs outlined in the Group's Interim Results presentation in September 2025, this review has centred around three key focus areas: simplification, prioritisation and investment.\nAs part of the review the Board has assessed the Group's approach to investment in its core strategic assets to ensure that they retain relevance and scale in a fast-evolving marketplace to deliver enhanced, sustained operating margins and cashflows for the Group.\nAfter assessing the existing structure of the Group through this lens and working closely with agency leadership teams, the Group is rationalising its B2C and B2B advertising agencies and will consolidate capabilities and leadership across these. Simultaneously, the Group will also consolidate the capabilities of its Sports Marketing and Events businesses under one leader.\nThis simplified structure alongside our continued investment in AI will unlock significant opportunities, broaden geographic reach, enable more effective deployment of talent and investment, and improved delivery for Clients.\nAnnualised cost savings of between \u00a31.5m and \u00a32m are expected, with operational efficiencies achieved through shared infrastructure, streamlined processes, and the consolidation of office and technology platforms.\nNotice of FY25 Results\nThe Board expects to announce Full Year results on 24 March 2026.\nPLC Board\nAs announced separately this morning, the Group is pleased to welcome Jon Kempster and Emma Wright as Non-Executive Directors of the Group, effective 1 February 2026. Alongside the recent appointment of Claudine Collins as a Non-Executive Director they bring vast experience and expertise in their respective fields, with extensive Boardroom experience and leadership in emerging technology such as AI.\nJon will also take over as Audit Committee Chair, replacing Mark Lund OBE who will step down from the Board, effective today. These appointments complete the strengthening and refreshment of our PLC Board.\nChange in accounting reference date\nThe Group's business activities and revenues are weighted towards the second half of the calendar year and particularly the final quarter. After engagement with certain Shareholders and having considered our internal processes, the Board has decided to change the accounting reference date to achieve a more balanced first half and second half weighting. Accordingly, the Group's next financial year (which would otherwise end on 31 December 2026), will be reduced by three months to 30 September 2026. The changes to the Company's reporting timetable are set out in the appendix below.\nJohn Carey, MISSION'S Chief Executive, commented:\n\"As widely reported across the industry, trading remained challenging in Q4 and I would like to thank all of our people for their continued commitment to delivering for our Clients.\nWe have not been immune from the impact of uncertainty on Client decision-making, which impacted our FY2025 result. But I am encouraged by the resilience of our underlying performance and the outcomes of our strategy review as we look into 2026 and beyond.\nThe actions we have taken to significantly simplify the structure are an exciting first step in the next phase of the Group's growth and we look forward to providing further updates in due course. The management team and Board are laser focused on unlocking the growth potential in the Group.\"\n1. For the purpose of this announcement, the Group believes market consensus for FY25 to be revenues of \u00a373.0 million and operating profit of \u00a38.5 million.\n2. Headline results are calculated before acquisition and disposal adjustments, start-up costs, goodwill and business impairment, bank refinancing, equity placing and restructuring costs.\nInside Information: This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\nENDS\nJohn Carey, Chief Executive\nGiles Lee, Chief Financial Officer\nVia Houston\nThe\nMISSION\nGroup PLC\nSimon Bridges/Andrew Potts/Harry Rees\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Financial Adviser, Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n020 7523 8000\nPeter Tracey\nBlackdown Partners Limited\n(Financial Adviser)\n020 3807 8484\nKate Hoare/Charlie Barker\nHouston PR\n077 3303 2695 / 0204 529 0549\nE:\nmission@houston.co.uk\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nThe\nMISSION\nGroup Plc. is the Alternative Group for Ambitious Brands.\nDelivering measurable, results-driven campaigns as the preferred creative partner for real business growth.

We offer top-tier agencies, strategic specialisms and global reach delivering outstanding performance for brands. We call it Work That Counts\u2122\nwww.themission.co.uk\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nOVERVIEW\nThe successful completion of\nMISSION\n's Value Restoration Plan (\"VRP\") in the prior year, combined with the restructuring of its operations in early 2025, has positioned the Group to move forward as a much leaner and less complex business. This underpinned a positive headline performance in H1, despite an ongoing challenging trading backdrop.\nThe restructure and reorganisation programme outlined earlier this year by Interim CEO, Mark Lund, was completed quickly and as a result the platform for significantly improving operating margins is now very much in place. This has been achieved through the simplification of the Group structure, reduction of central operating units and the organisation of the Group around four key Agency segments of Business & Corporate, Consumer, Sports & Entertainment and Property. These segments are focused on the growth of their agency brands, driving efficiency and so improving operating margins.\nThe Group is therefore encouraged to report total H1 revenue of \u00a334.1m and revenue from continuing operations of \u00a333.7m (30 June 2024: \u00a335.3m from continuing operations**, \u00a342.2m from all operations). Whilst overall revenues were inevitably impacted by the challenging trading backdrop, headline operating profit before adjustments for the Period of \u00a32.2m (30 June 2024: \u00a31.9m from continuing operations, \u00a32.6m from all operations) was driven by margin improvements in the Business & Corporate and Property segments alongside a significant reduction in central function costs resulting from the restructuring behind the key Agency brands.\nHeadline profit before tax for the Period has benefitted from much reduced interest charges compared to 2024 and is \u00a31.1m (30 June 2024: \u00a30.6m from continuing operations, \u00a31.3m from all operations).\nPerformance and progress\nThe Group's trading environment continued to be challenging in H1 2025 with the global macro and political uncertainty continuing to manifest in client caution and reduced marketing spend\n,\nresulting in a reduction in Group revenue from continuing operations of 4%.\nWhilst the majority of this reduction was felt in the Consumer & Lifestyle segment where the market remains more challenged, it was pleasing to see a more resilient performance from other market segments including Property, highlighting the diversification benefits of the Group's portfolio.\nClient retention across the Group remained strong with\nadditional Client wins secured across the business throughout the period including Google, TikTok International, Accenture and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\nSince the period end, the Group has secured several notable new business wins including Marlink, Co-op, Boehringer Seraquin, Amaala Yacht Club and The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The robust and high-quality new business pipeline for H2 provides some encouraging momentum despite broader macro-economic uncertainty and a challenging trading environment.\nFinally, the Group AI transformation steering team continues to make good progress in driving the continuous enhancement of our Client offering and business operations through the integration of AI. Initial areas of focus have centred on driving efficiencies across the Group's management systems, the enhancement of content and production, improvements to our Client insight reporting and the roll out of an AI learning and development plan for our teams. Whilst early in our plans we are encouraged by the pace of adoption and implementation of these various initiatives which are running to plan and we look forward to providing more updates in due course.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nBillings and Revenue:\nTotal turnover (\"billings\") for H1 was \u00a383.4m (H1 2024: \u00a394.4m) while total operating income (\"revenue\") of \u00a334.1m compares to \u00a342.2m for the period to 30 June 2024. The major reductions reflect the disposal of April Six Ltd and related subsidiaries at the end of December 2024.\nTaking continuing operations only, turnover (\"billings\") for H1 increased by 3% to \u00a382.8m (2024: \u00a380.4m) while operating income (\"revenue\") of \u00a333.7m has reduced compared to the \u00a335.3m for the period to 30 June 2024.\nProfit, Margins and Earnings Per Share\nThe Group has focused on margin improvement and in so doing has restructured and reengineered the business to be more efficient and focused on revenue delivery. This firm, but future-focused cost control, alongside a continued commitment to transforming our infrastructure through the\nMISSION\nShared Services initiatives, has enabled the Group to deliver a \u00a31.9m reduction in operating expenditure for the period to 30 June 2025 compared to the 2024 equivalent. As a direct result of this the Group has delivered an operating profit from continuing operations that is ahead of the prior year comparison.\nHeadline operating profits from continuing operations for H1 increased by 15% to \u00a32.2m (30 June 2024: \u00a31.9m from continuing operations, \u00a32.6m from all operations). Headline operating margin from continuing operations increased to 6.5% (H1 2024 equivalent: 5.4%). Continuing activities in 2024 exclude the results of April Six Ltd which was sold in December 2024 and the Group's 70% interest in the Asian business Bray Leino Splash PTE Ltd which was disposed of in Q1 2025.\nThe Segmental Analysis for the new Group structure is summarised in the following table.\nH1 2025 \u00a3m\nBusiness & Corporate\nConsumer & Lifestyle\nHealth & Wellness\nProperty\nSports & Entert'mnt\nCentral\nTotal Continuing\nRevenue\n10.9\n10.1\n1.3\n7.7\n3.8\n0.0\n33.7\nHeadline operating profit\n1.1\n0.3\n-0.1\n1.1\n0.2\n-0.4\n2.2\nmargin %\n10%\n3%\n-11%\n15%\n4%\n6.5%\nH1 2024 \u00a3m\nBusiness & Corporate\nConsumer & Lifestyle\nHealth & Wellness\nProperty\nSports & Entert'mnt\nCentral\nTotal Continuing\nRevenue\n11.0\n11.2\n1.7\n7.5\n4.0\n0.0\n35.3\nHeadline operating profit\n0.8\n0.5\n0.0\n1.0\n0.5\n-1.0\n1.9\nmargin %\n7%\n5%\n0%\n13%\n13%\n5.4%\nChange \u00a3m\nBusiness & Corporate\nConsumer & Lifestyle\nHealth & Wellness\nProperty\nSports & Entert'mnt\nCentral\nTotal Continuing\nRevenue\n-0.1\n-1.1\n-0.4\n0.2\n-0.2\n0.0\n-1.6\nRev %+/-\n-1%\n-10%\n-22%\n3%\n-6%\n-4%\nHeadline operating profit\n0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.1\n-0.4\n0.6\n0.3\nmargin %\n2.4%\n-1.6%\n-10.6%\n1.5%\n-8.5%\n1.1%\nThe Property and Business & Corporate segments have both performed well in H1, with profits and margins ahead of H1 2024. Operating income (revenue) in the Consumer & Lifestyle segment reduced by \u00a31.1m in an undoubtedly tough marketplace, however the work on simplification and effectiveness means that the profit reduction year-on-year has been mitigated to \u00a30.2m. The Sports & Entertainment segment was also down somewhat year on year reflecting the timing of new rights deals being approved. As noted above, significant savings have been made within central function costs (\u00a30.6m year on year).\nFinancing costs reduced to \u00a31.1m (H1 2024: \u00a31.5m). Within this total, net interest on bank loans, overdrafts and deposits reduced to \u00a30.6m (H1 2024 \u00a31.0m), reflecting a lower average level of debt in the period. Amortisation of bank debt arrangement fees increased by \u00a30.1m to \u00a30.1m (H1 2024: \u00a30.0m) as a result of the Group agreeing a new revolving credit facility on 21 March 2025 and expensing all unamortised arrangement fees relating to the previous credit agreement. Underlying financing costs for H2 are expected to remain at similar levels to H1.\nHeadline profit before tax increased by 97% to \u00a31.1m (30 June 2024: \u00a30.6m from continuing operations, \u00a31.3m from all operations), as a result of the reduced financing costs and resilient operating profit.\nH1 Adjustments:\nFollowing the disposal of April Six in December 2024 the Board commenced a restructuring programme with the objective of further streamlining the Group and driving efficiency. This has been completed, and the Group is now organised by four primary Agency pillars, each of which are focused on securing the growth potential of their respective agency brands and, importantly, on improving their respective operating margin. The \u00a31.7m cost incurred as part of this restructure, both at the Agency level as well as central, are directly related to reducing ongoing operating expenditure (primarily headcount) and improving efficiency and operating margin. As a result, the payback on this cost is expected to be recovered within 12 months and has supported the overall improved operating margin and reduction in operating expenditure of \u00a31.9m in the period.\nAs part of this restructuring the Group also disposed of its 70% majority shareholding of Bray Leino Splash PTE Ltd and related subsidiaries, the Bray Leino Asia operations, for a nominal sum and below the last reported book value, which further simplifies the Group's operations.\nThe disposal of April Six Ltd, our US Technology specialist agency, on 31 December 2024 included an earn-out component based on earnings for December 2024, January 2025 and February 2025. The earn-out was capped at \u00a34.2m and estimated in the 2024 report and accounts at \u00a32.0m, but the downturn in Q1 2025 in the US Technology sector has resulted in a final payment of only \u00a30.1m. As a consequence, a \u00a31.9m reduction to the reported profit/loss on the sale of April Six has been recognised in H1.\nSummary of H1 Adjustments:\nAs detailed above, adjustments of \u00a35m have been incurred in H1 as follows\n\u00b7\n\u00a31.7m cash cost of the Group restructuring following the April Six disposal, including associated redundancy costs.\n\u00b7\n\u00a32.8m non-cash adjustment related to the disposal of Splash Interactive PTE (\u00a30.9m) and April Six (\u00a31.9m).\n\u00b7\n\u00a30.3m of amortisation and other acquisition costs\n\u00b7\n\u00a30.2m of start-up costs relating to the geographical expansion of the Sports & Entertainment business.\nThe Group estimates an effective tax rate on headline profits before tax of 25% (H1 2024: 25%), resulting in an increase in headline earnings to \u00a30.8m for the six months (H1 2024: \u00a30.5m from continuing operations, \u00a30.9m from all operations) and reported loss after tax on all operations of \u00a33.7m (H1 2024: \u00a30.0m).\nHeadline diluted EPS from continuing operations increased to 0.9 pence (H1 2024: 0.6 pence). Fully diluted EPS from all operations decreased to a loss of 4.1 pence (H1 2024: loss of 0.1 pence).\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe key balance sheet ratio measured and monitored by the Board is the ratio of net bank debt to headline EBITDA (\"leverage ratio\"). The Group closed the half year at 2.8x (30 June 2024: 3.5x, 31 December 2024: 2.2x) based on the trailing 12-month headline EBITDA. The ratio offers significant headroom against the facility limit of 3.5x for the period.\nThe Board also monitors the ratio of total debt, including outstanding acquisition obligations, to headline EBITDA and this ratio has also decreased year on year, to 3.1x (30 June 2024: 3.9x, 31 December 2024: 2.6x). Again, there is significant headroom against the facility limit of 4.0x for the period.\nThe Group spent \u00a3nil on acquisitions during the period (2024 \u00a3nil) and a total of \u00a32.2m of acquisition obligations from prior years were settled in the first half of the year all of which were in cash (30 June 2024: \u00a31.1m of which \u00a30.6m were cash and the remainder settled in shares). After adjustments to estimated future contingent consideration payments the total estimated acquisition liability at 30 June 2025 totalled \u00a32.5m (30 June 2024: \u00a34.4m). Of this \u00a31.0m is due for payment in the second half of 2025.\nCapital expenditures continue to be strictly controlled with spend of \u00a30.3m (H1 2024 \u00a30.3m).\nTrade and other receivables from continuing operations increased by \u00a39.8m across the first six months of 2025 compared to an increase of \u00a35.8m in the equivalent period in 2024. Payables have also increased and by a similar amount, \u00a39.6m (H1 2024: \u00a32.8m). The net result is a reduction in net working capital from continuing operations of \u00a32.7m compared to H1 2024.\nNet bank debt was \u00a313.7m on 30 June 2025. This compares to \u00a319.6m on 30 June 2024, and \u00a39.5m on 31 December 2024 following the April Six disposal. The increase from 31 December 2024 is primarily a result of the settlement of outstanding acquisition obligations of \u00a32.2m in H1, the cash cost of the restructuring programme noted (\u00a31.7m) and the shares bought back in the Period totalling \u00a30.4m.\nTotal debt (being net bank debt plus outstanding acquisition obligations) closed at \u00a316.2m (30 June 2024: \u00a324.0m), and\n\u00a314.2m on 31 December 2024.\nDividend\nThe Board has made the decision to keep dividend payments paused alongside other major capital allocations until balance sheet strength is restored and net debt is reduced (2024: 0 pence per share). The Board will keep this decision under regular review.\nShare buyback\nOn 2 January 2025 the Company announced a share buyback programme\nf\nor on market purchases of up to \u00a31.5 million. Shares bought back in the Period totalled \u00a30.4m. The Board has paused the share buyback programme but remains alert to resuming the buyback should opportunities arise over the remaining half year.\nBOARD\nThe Company has recently announced a number of changes to its Board composition.\nOn 1 July 2025 the Board was\npleased to announce that following an external process,\u00a0John Carey\u00a0had been appointed to the Board as Chief Executive Officer with effect from\u00a01 September 2025.\nA highly experienced international leader, John brings a diverse breadth of commercial and business transformation expertise most recently\nholding executive leadership positions at Castrol, BP plc and\nAbu Dhabi National Oil Corporation for Distribution, where he led the company's IPO in 2017.\nFollowing John's appointment, Mark Lund, Interim Chief Executive, has resumed his previous role as Non-Executive Director and\nChair of the Board's Audit and Risk Committee\n.\nOn 12 September 2025 the Board announced the appointment of Claudine Collins as Non-Executive Director of the Group and Chair of the Remuneration Committee. Claudine draws on a career spanning over 30 years in the media industry having held several leadership positions in media agencies, and most recently Chief Client Officer at EssenceMediacom UK, part of WPP.\nShe will replace Eliza Filby who has informed the Board that she will be stepping down from her role as Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 30th September 2025 following over three years of service to the Board.\nMAKING POSITIVE CHANGE\nOver the course of the period, we have made further progress against our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments, outlined in our manifesto 'Making Positive Change'.\nTraction against our social goals, focused on building diverse and healthy teams and supporting the communities we work within, has been a key priority. The impactful community work across the Group through pro bono support, donations and volunteering has been tremendous helping to address key social challenges from elderly care and homelessness to conservation and education entry pathways into the creative industries.\nAnother important priority has been positive traction in our commitment to reduce carbon emissions as a Group. We have benchmarked and set our emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and validated these targets via the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard. We have a near-term (2029) target of reducing all emissions from our baseline of 2019 by 44%. Although we have seen an increase in emissions by 13% from 2023 to 2024, due to an increase in office presence and travel combined with enhanced accuracy in our carbon reporting, we are on track to meet our near-term targets with an overall 32% reduction on 2019 emissions as at the end of 2024.\nThe next six months will be key in our ESG journey as we prepare for ISSB updating its sustainability rules (IFRS S2 and SASB Standards) to make climate and industry disclosures clearer and more consistent worldwide. We will be developing a Materiality Assessment and reviewing current reporting - especially Scope 3 emissions and industry-specific metrics - so we can adapt smoothly when the new rules take effect in 2026.\nOUTLOOK\nAs in previous years, Group profitability is heavily weighted to the second half of the year.\nWhile we remain very mindful of the challenging trading environment, the Group currently remains on track to meet full-year headline operating profit and margin expectations.\nRecent new business wins and continued support from our loyal Client base should hold us in good stead given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevails that is exemplified by increasing approval periods especially within new business assignments.\nOur Agencies continue to punch above their weight and our Client roster has been further strengthened with a number of blue-chip brands.\nCondensed Consolidated Income Statement for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nContinuing operations\nSix months to\nDiscontinued operations*\nSix months to\nTotal\nSix months to\nContinuing operations Six months to\nDiscontinued operations**\nSix months to\nTotal\nSix months to\nContinuing operations Year ended\nDiscontinued operations**\nYear ended\nTotal\nYear ended\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2024\n30 June\n2024\n30 June\n2024\n31 December 2024\n31 December 2024\n31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nAudited\nAudited\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTURNOVER\n2\n82,830\n529\n83,359\n80,414\n13,978\n94,392\n155,949\n34,363\n190,312\nCost of sales\n(49,106)\n(171)\n(49,277)\n(45,102)\n(7,058)\n(52,160)\n(81,871)\n(20,757)\n(102,628)\nOPERATING INCOME\n2\n33,724\n358\n34,082\n35,312\n6,920\n42,232\n74,078\n13,606\n87,684\nHeadline operating expenses\n(31,547)\n(359)\n(31,906)\n(33,413)\n(6,195)\n(39,608)\n(66,439)\n(12,175)\n(78,614)\nHEADLINE OPERATING PROFIT / (LOSS)\n2,177\n(1)\n2,176\n1,899\n725\n2,624\n7,639\n1,431\n9,070\nLoss on sale of subsidiaries (Note 11.2)\n-\n(959)\n(959)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(209)\n(209)\nStart-up costs\n3\n(216)\n-\n(216)\n(86)\n-\n(86)\n(458)\n-\n(458)\nAcquisition and disposal adjustments\n4\n(248)\n(1,950)\n(2,198)\n(626)\n-\n(626)\n(2,090)\n-\n(2,090)\nRestructuring costs\n3\n(1,736)\n-\n(1,736)\n-\n(203)\n(203)\n-\n(243)\n(243)\nBank refinancing and equity raise costs\n-\n-\n-\n(242)\n-\n(242)\n(242)\n-\n(242)\nOPERATING (LOSS) / PROFIT\n(23)\n(2,910)\n(2,933)\n945\n522\n1,467\n4,849\n979\n5,828\nShare of results of associates and joint ventures\n40\n-\n40\n75\n-\n75\n80\n-\n80\nPROFIT / (LOSS) BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXATION\n17\n(2,910)\n(2,893)\n1,020\n522\n1,542\n4,929\n979\n5,908\nNet finance costs\n5\n(1,117)\n-\n(1,117)\n(1,474)\n(20)\n(1,494)\n(2,962)\n(35)\n(2,997)\n(LOSS) / PROFIT BEFORE TAXATION\n(1,100)\n(2,910)\n(4,010)\n(454)\n502\n48\n1,967\n944\n2,911\nTaxation\n6\n268\n18\n286\n219\n(305)\n(86)\n(952)\n(759)\n(1,711)\n(LOSS) / PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD\n(832)\n(2,892)\n(3,724)\n(235)\n197\n(38)\n1,015\n185\n1,200\nAttributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n(867)\n(2,889)\n(3,756)\n(275)\n187\n(88)\n889\n164\n1,053\nNon-controlling interests\n35\n(3)\n32\n40\n10\n50\n126\n21\n147\n(832)\n(2,892)\n(3,724)\n(235)\n197\n(38)\n1,015\n185\n1,200\nBasic earnings per share (pence)\n7\n(1.0)\n(3.2)\n(4.1)\n(0.3)\n0.2\n(0.1)\n1.0\n0.2\n1.2\nDiluted earnings per share (pence)\n7\n(1.0)\n(3.2)\n(4.1)\n(0.3)\n0.2\n(0.1)\n1.0\n0.2\n1.2\nHeadline basic earnings per share (pence)\n7\n0.9\n0.0\n0.9\n0.6\n0.4\n1.0\n3.7\n0.1\n3.8\nHeadline diluted earnings per share (pence)\n7\n0.9\n0.0\n0.9\n0.6\n0.4\n1.0\n3.7\n0.1\n3.7\n* Discontinued operations in 2025 consist of the results of Splash, sold on 31 March 2025 (see note 11.2)\n** Discontinued operations in 2024 include the results of April Six, sold in 2024, and the results of Splash.

Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2025\n1.\nAccounting Policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" and the Group's accounting policies.\nThe Group's accounting policies are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom and are set out in the Group's Annual Report and Accounts 2024 on pages 76-80. These are consistent with the accounting policies which the Group expects to adopt in its 2025 Annual Report. The Group has not early-adopted any Standard, Interpretation or Amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.\nThe information relating to the six months ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 is unaudited and does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been extracted from the Group's Annual Report and Accounts 2024, on which the auditors gave an unqualified opinion and did not include a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The Group Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have considered the financial projections of the Group, including cash flow forecasts, the availability of committed bank facilities and the headroom against covenant tests for the coming 12 months. The Directors have also considered and understood the mitigating actions that would be required in the event of reduced revenue profiles and any consequential difficulties with covenant compliance. Such potential mitigating actions would include a review of headcount, particularly in the areas impacted by any downturn. The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these interim financial statements.\nAccounting estimates and judgements\nThe Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future and the resulting estimates may, by definition, vary from the actual results. The Directors considered the critical accounting estimates and judgements used in the interim financial statements and concluded that the main areas of judgement are:\n\u00b7\nPotential impairment of goodwill;\n\u00b7\nContingent payments in respect of acquisitions and disposals;\n\u00b7\nRevenue recognition policies in respect of contracts which straddle the period end; and\n\u00b7\nRevenue recognised in respect of incomplete contracts involving commission or success fee arrangements.\n2. Segmental Information\nBusiness segmentation\nFor management purposes the Board monitors the performance of its individual agencies and groups them into service segments based on the sectors in which they operate. Each reportable segment therefore includes a number of agencies with similar characteristics.\nThe Board assesses the performance of each segment by looking at turnover, operating income and headline operating profit. The headline operating profit shown below is after the reallocation to the agencies of certain head office costs relating to the Shared Services function. These costs include a significant portion of the total operating costs which are now centrally managed.\nThe Board does not review the assets and liabilities of the Group on a segmental basis.

In 2025, restructuring costs consist of redundancy, PILON and TUPE related costs, as well as other related costs associated with the restructuring and reorganisation of the Group.\nStart-up costs derive from organically started businesses or loss-making businesses acquired and comprise the trading losses of such entities until the earlier of two years from commencement or when they show evidence of becoming sustainably profitable. Start-up costs in 2024 related to the launch of Turbine and the launch of the US and Saudi offices of the Influence business.

This upward revision is driven by improved performance by the recent acquisitions. The movement in fair value of consideration on disposals relates to a net downward revision in the estimate receivable from the sale of April Six. Acquisition and disposal transaction costs relate to professional fees in connection with disposals and acquisitions made or contemplated, including reverse acquisitions.\n5.

In addition, the remaining unamortised bank debt arrangement fees relating to the replaced facility were fully written off during the period. These additional bank debt arrangement fees, over and above what would have been amortised had the Group not refinanced, were classified as a headline adjustment.\n6. Taxation\nThe taxation charge for the period ended 30 June 2025 has been based on an estimated effective tax rate on headline profit on ordinary activities of 25% (30 June 2024: 25%).\n7.

This has been achieved despite trading conditions remaining challenging.\nAt the same time, as macroeconomic uncertainty has continued this has impacted certain project completions in some business lines, most noticeably in our integrated consumer marketing agencies. Pipelines remain strong and growing, but completions of certain major projects have carried over from H2 2025 into H1 2026, which has impacted FY2025 revenues. As a consequence, we expect FY2025 revenues to be \u00a368.0m and headline operating profit to be \u00a35.1m, below market expectations1.\nOur balance sheet improved over the year, with net bank debt on 31 December 2025 at \u00a39.0m (31 December 2024: \u00a39.5m). Total debt including outstanding acquisition liabilities at 31 December 2025 is \u00a310.3m, a substantial reduction and improvement on the 31 December 2024 balance of \u00a314.2m following strong cash conversion.\nPlan for future strategic success\nFollowing the appointment of John Carey as Chief Executive in September 2025, the Board has undertaken a review of the Group's strategy to position the Company for its next chapter of growth and achieve a positive net cash position.\nAs outlined in the Group's Interim Results presentation in September 2025, this review has centred around three key focus areas: simplification, prioritisation and investment.\nAs part of the review the Board has assessed the Group's approach to investment in its core strategic assets to ensure that they retain relevance and scale in a fast-evolving marketplace to deliver enhanced, sustained operating margins and cashflows for the Group.\nAfter assessing the existing structure of the Group through this lens and working closely with agency leadership teams, the Group is rationalising its B2C and B2B advertising agencies and will consolidate capabilities and leadership across these. Simultaneously, the Group will also consolidate the capabilities of its Sports Marketing and Events businesses under one leader.\nThis simplified structure alongside our continued investment in AI will unlock significant opportunities, broaden geographic reach, enable more effective deployment of talent and investment, and improved delivery for Clients.\nAnnualised cost savings of between \u00a31.5m and \u00a32m are expected, with operational efficiencies achieved through shared infrastructure, streamlined processes, and the consolidation of office and technology platforms.\nNotice of FY25 Results\nThe Board expects to announce Full Year results on 24 March 2026.\nPLC Board\nAs announced separately this morning, the Group is pleased to welcome Jon Kempster and Emma Wright as Non-Executive Directors of the Group, effective 1 February 2026. Alongside the recent appointment of Claudine Collins as a Non-Executive Director they bring vast experience and expertise in their respective fields, with extensive Boardroom experience and leadership in emerging technology such as AI.\nJon will also take over as Audit Committee Chair, replacing Mark Lund OBE who will step down from the Board, effective today. These appointments complete the strengthening and refreshment of our PLC Board.\nChange in accounting reference date\nThe Group's business activities and revenues are weighted towards the second half of the calendar year and particularly the final quarter. After engagement with certain Shareholders and having considered our internal processes, the Board has decided to change the accounting reference date to achieve a more balanced first half and second half weighting. Accordingly, the Group's next financial year (which would otherwise end on 31 December 2026), will be reduced by three months to 30 September 2026. The changes to the Company's reporting timetable are set out in the appendix below.\nJohn Carey, MISSION'S Chief Executive, commented:\n\"As widely reported across the industry, trading remained challenging in Q4 and I would like to thank all of our people for their continued commitment to delivering for our Clients.\nWe have not been immune from the impact of uncertainty on Client decision-making, which impacted our FY2025 result. But I am encouraged by the resilience of our underlying performance and the outcomes of our strategy review as we look into 2026 and beyond.\nThe actions we have taken to significantly simplify the structure are an exciting first step in the next phase of the Group's growth and we look forward to pr",

We enter H2 with a strong new business pipeline which provides the Board with confidence in delivering profitable growth across all business segments. The Group remains on track to deliver full year revenue targets broadly in line with expectations* and at least to meet full-year headline operating profit and margin expectations*.\nFINANCIALS\nProfit & Loss\nThe Group expects to report H1 organic revenue of \u00a334.5m\u00a0(30 June 2024:\u00a0\u00a335.3m from continuing operations**, \u00a342.2m from all operations) for the Period, with improved headline\u00a0operating profit before adjustments of \u00a32.1m\u00a0(30 June 2024:\u00a0\u00a31.9m\u00a0from continuing operations, \u00a32.6m from all operations).\nHeadline profit before tax for the Period has benefitted from much reduced interest charges compared to 2024 and is expected to be \u00a31.0m\u00a0(30 June 2024:\u00a0\u00a30.5m from continuing operations, \u00a31.3m from all operations).\nBalance Sheet\nTotal debt has reduced compared to the equivalent period in 2024 with debt\u00a0including outstanding acquisition obligations estimated to be \u00a316.1m\u00a0on\u00a030 June 2025. This represents a reduction of\u00a0\u00a37.9m\u00a0compared to the position of\u00a0\u00a324.0m\u00a0on\u00a030 June 2024. Total debt (including outstanding acquisition obligations) on 31 December 2024 stood at \u00a314.2m.\nNet bank debt is estimated to be \u00a313.6m\u00a0on\u00a030 June 2025. This compares to \u00a319.6m on 30 June 2024, and \u00a39.5m on 31 December 2024 following the April Six disposal. The increase from 31 December 2024 is primarily a result of the settlement of outstanding acquisition obligations of \u00a32.2m in H1, the cash cost of the restructuring programme noted below (\u00a31.6m) and the shares bought back in the Period totalling \u00a30.4m. The Board has paused the share buyback programme announced on 2 January 2025 but remains alert to resume the buyback should opportunities arise over the remaining half year.\nH1 Adjustments\nFollowing the disposal of April Six in December 2024 we commenced a restructuring programme with the objective of further streamlining the Group and driving efficiency. This has been completed, and the Group is now organised by four Agency pillars, each of which are focused on securing the growth potential of their respective agency brands and, importantly, on improving their respective operating margin. The \u00a31.6m cost incurred as part of this restructure, both at the Agency level as well as central, are directly related to reducing ongoing operating expenditure (primarily headcount) and improving efficiency and operating margin. As a result, the payback on this cost is expected to be recovered within 12 months and should support an overall improved operating margin.\nAs part of this restructuring we also disposed of our 70% majority shareholding of Bray Leino Splash PTE Ltd, our Bray Leino Asia operations, for a nominal sum and below our last reported book value, which further simplifies the Group's operations.\nThe disposal of April Six Ltd, our US Technology specialist agency, on 31 December 2024 included an earn-out component based on earnings for December 2024, January 2025 and February 2025. The earn-out was capped at \u00a34.2m and estimated in the 2024 report and accounts at \u00a32.0m, but the downturn in Q1 2025 in the US Technology sector has resulted in a final payment of only \u00a30.1m. As a consequence, a \u00a31.9m reduction to the reported profit/loss on the sale of April Six will be recognised in H1.\nSummary of H1 Adjustments\nAs detailed above, adjustments of \u00a34.4m will be incurred in H1 as follows\n-\n\u00a31.6m cash cost of the Group restructuring following the April Six disposal, including associated redundancy costs.\n-\n\u00a32.8m non-cash adjustment related to the disposal of Splash Interactive PTE (\u00a30.9m) and April Six (\u00a31.9m).\nNOTICE OF RESULTS\nThe Group expects to announce its interim results for ",

The Company will provide instructions to buy back Shares as and when its management believes that, at the time of instruction, these repurchases are at or below the Board's view of the intrinsic value of the Company and be in the best interests of shareholders generally. From time to time, the Company may also provide one or more time-limited, irrevocable, non-discretionary instructions to Canaccord Genuity to make trading decisions and repurchase Shares within those instructions independently of the Company. Any purchases of shares made during closed periods pursuant to the Share Buyback Programme shall be made independently of and uninfluenced by the Company.\nFurther details of the Share Buyback Programme\n\u00b7\nThe purpose of the Share Buyback Programme is to return capital to those shareholders wishing to participate in the Share Buyback.\n\u00b7\nThe Share Buyback will be financed from existing cash resources.\n\u00b7\nThe aggregate number of Shares acquired by the Company pursuant to the Share Buyback shall not exceed the maximum number of ordinary shares which the Company is authorised to purchase pursuant to the General Authority, set out above.\n\u00b7\nIn accordance with the General Authority, the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each Share is an amount equal to the higher of (i) 105 per cent of the average of the middle market quotations for a Share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the Company agrees to buy the shares concerned; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade of any Share and the highest current independent bid for a Share in the trading venue where the purchase is carried out. Furthermore, in accordance with the General Authority, the minimum price which may be paid for each Share is 10 pence.\n\u00b7\nIt is intended that the Share Buyback Programme will, insofar as is possible, be conducted in accordance with the safe harbour parameters of MAR (as defined below); however, given the limited liquidity in the Shares, the Share Buyback may on any given trading day represent a significant proportion of the daily trading volume in the Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange and could exceed 25 per cent of the average daily trading volume. Accordingly, the Group may not benefit from the exemption contained in Article 5(1) in the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulations (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) as incorporated into UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\")\n\u00b7\nThe Share Buyback will commence on the date of this announcement and is anticipated to end at the earlier of the 2025 annual general meeting or until the number of Shares equal to the Maximum Monetary Amount have been purchased under the Share Buyback or the process is terminated or paused.\n\u00b7\nThe purchased Shares will be held by the Company in treasury for later reissue or cancellation, at the Company's discretion. Shares held in treasury are, subject to the Companies Act 2006, not entitled to distributions or dividends and the rights and obligations of such shares shall be suspended (including any voting rights at the Company general meetings).\n\u00b7\nShare bu",

(\"Marketbridge\") for a total gross consideration of up to \u00a317.4 million (\"Total Consideration\").\nThe Total Consideration comprises (1) an initial payment on a cash free, debt free normalised working capital basis and adjusted for Client prepayments, costs, fees and incentives of \u00a310.5 million received in cash and (2) an earn out of up to \u00a34.2 million payable in cash calculated at the lesser of\n\u00a34.2 million\nor 7.0x Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (\n\"EBITDA\")\nfor the period from and including 1st December 2024 to 28th February 2025 with payment scheduled for June 2025 (the \"Earn Out Payment\").\nApril Six, with offices across the US as well as in London, is a full-service integrated agency specialising in technology and science, with a strong, blue chip Client base. The Board believes that April Six will benefit from ownership by a US headquartered owner who can support its plans in the US, its largest market opportunity for growth. April Six's 2024 financial performance has seen a steady recovery over 2023, but remains below levels achieved in 2022.\nFurther details on historical April Six performance and an illustrative pro-forma are included at the end of this announcement.\nFiona Shepherd, founder and CEO of April Six will remain with April Six and steps down from the board of the Company with immediate effect following 14 years' service as a Board member.\nThe disposal of April Six marks the completion of the Group's Value Restoration Plan (\"VRP\") announced on 20th December 2023. Through self-help actions the VRP has delivered \u00a35 million of annualised operational improvements in 2024 and has significantly strengthened\nMISSION\n's financial position with two business disposals.\nThe net proceeds received by the Group will be used to pay down bank debt with NatWest and results in a material reduction in net debt, with significant positive improvements to both the net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio and the interest cover ratio, which we believe will both further improve once the final earn out payment is received. Under the terms of the NatWest facility agreement, the transaction is considered a 'deleveraging event' which results in a better covenant package for the Group.\nNet bank debt at 30 December 2024 was \u00a317.0 million, and therefore the pro forma net bank debt at 30 December 2024 including the \u00a310.5 million net proceeds from the sale of April Six will be \u00a36.5 million.\nCAPITAL ALLOCATION POLICY - DEBT REPAYMENT, SHARE BUYBACKS, DIVIDENDS\nHaving delivered annualised cost savings and profit improvements and a material reduction in the Group's debt burden through business disposals the Board believes it is appropriate to update Shareholders on the Board's intentions for future uses of cash generated from operations by presenting the Group's Capital Allocation policy:\n1. Maintain a strong balance sheet with target leverage ratio\nbetween net cash and\n1.0x headline EBITDA over the medium-term with flexibility on occasions to move above this as the business needs' demands.\n2. Invest in organic growth across the Group, funding projects and initiatives which the Directors believe will have a demonstrably high return and/or improve quality of earnings.\n3.\nOver time, surplus free cashflow should be returned to shareholders either by share buybacks and/or dividends (ordinary and/or special).\nShare buybacks will be undertaken when they are at or below the Board's view of the intrinsic value of the Company. Shares acquired through the share buyback will be held in treasury and their use reviewed periodically.\nThe Board expects to return to paying ordinary dividends in 2026 and will maintain dividend cover\nbetween 3x to 4x headline earnings per share.\nThe Board is pleased to announce it intends to return up to \u00a31.5m to Shareholders via an on-market share buyback expected to commence immediately in accordance with its Capital Allocation policy.\nA trading update for the year ended 31 December 2024 will be announced during the week commencing 20 January 2025.\nDavid Morgan, MISSION's Non-Executive Chair, commented:\n\"Over the past 12 months we have taken steps that have restored value to\nMISSION\nshareholders through operational improvement and business disposals.

          "full_content": "10 Jun 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 7025R\nBrave Bison Group PLC\n10 June 2024\nNOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT FALLING UNDER RULE 2.8 OF THE CITY CODE ON TAKEOVERS AND MERGERS (THE \" CODE\").\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.\n10 June 2024\nBrave Bison Group plc\n(\"Brave Bison\", together with its subsidiaries \"the Group\")\nUpdate on Possible Offer\nfor\nThe Mission Group plc\nNo Intention to Make a Firm Offer\nOn 13 May 2024 Brave Bison announced it was considering an offer to acquire The Mission Group plc (the \"\nPossible Offer\n\" and \"\nMission\n\"). On 3 June 2024, Brave Bison announced that it had submitted a revised proposal with enhanced terms to Mission (the \"\nRevised Proposal\n\"), which was subsequently rejected by the Mission Board on 6 June 2024.\nThe Revised Proposal provided for an exchange ratio of 13.9 Brave Bison shares for each Mission share. Based on the undisturbed Brave Bison share price of 2.525 pence per share on 10 May, the Revised Proposal represented a value for each Mission share of approximately 35.1 pence, representing a 55 per cent. premium to the undisturbed share price of 22.7 pence on 10 May 2024. The Revised Proposal also included a partial cash alternative of up to 50% of the offer value.\nAs part of the potential transaction, Brave Bison stated its intention to pay down a portion of Mission's \u00a326.8 million of net debt to create a sustainable capital structure for the enlarged company.\nThe Mission Board, led by the Chairman, rejected Brave Bison's attempts for constructive dialogue and chose not to provide access to due diligence information or key management personnel. Further, the Mission Board has not offered an extension to the PUSU deadline by which Brave Bison would be required to make a firm offer for Mission pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the Code.\nThe Board of Brave Bison is disappointed by the lack of engagement from the Mission Board and does not believe that the Mission Board's strategy to deleverage the business will deliver value for Mission shareholders in excess of the Revised Proposal.\nBrave Bison is a disciplined acquirer and is not willing to advance the Possible Offer without due diligence or access to key management. As such, Brave Bison confirms that it does not intend to make an offer for Mission under Rule 2.7 of the Code. This is a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies.\nFor the purposes of Note 2 on Rule 2.8 of the Code, Brave Bison, and any person(s) acting in concert with it, reserve the right to make or participate in an offer or possible offer for Mission (and/or take any other action which would otherwise be restricted under Rule 2.8 of the Code) within six months of the date of this announcement in the following circumstances:\na) with the agreement of the Mission Board;\nb) following the announcement of a firm intention to make an offer for Mission by or on behalf of a third party;\nc) following the announcement by Mission of a Rule 9 waiver proposal (as described in Note 1 of the Notes on Dispensations from Rule 9 of the Code) or a reverse takeover (as defined in the Code); or\nd) where the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers has determined that there has been a material change of circumstances.\nFor further information please contact:\nBrave Bison Group plc\nvia Hannam & Partners\nOliver Green, Executive Chairman\nTheo Green, Chief Growth Officer\nPhilippa Norridge, Chief Financial Officer\nHannam & Partners\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7907 8500\nFinancial Adviser\nAndrew Chubb\nErnest Bell\nLucia Sviatkova\nCavendish Capital Markets\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNominated Adviser & Broker\nBen Jeynes\nDan Hodkinson\nPowerscourt\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7250 1446\nFinancial PR\nElly Williamson\nPete Lambie\nOllie Simmonds\nBravebison@powerscourt-group.com\nImportant information\nThis announcement does not constitute a prospectus or prospectus equivalent document.\nThis announcement is not intended to, and does not, constitute or form part of any offer, invitation or the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of, any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction, pursuant to this announcement or otherwise.

THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT ANY OFFER WILL BE MADE\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.\n6 June 2024\nThe MISSION Group plc\n(\"MISSION\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nRESPONSE TO REVISED POSSIBLE OFFER ANNOUNCEMENT BY BRAVE BISON GROUP PLC\nMISSION\nGroup plc\u00a0(AIM: TMG)\n, notes the announcement released on 3 June 2024 by Brave Bison Group plc (\"\nBrave Bison\n\") in accordance with Rule 2.4 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"\nCode\n\") and confirms, in line with the announcement it made on 4 June 2024, that on 25 May 2024, it received a further unsolicited conditional proposal regarding a possible offer by Brave Bison for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of\nMISSION\n. Such possible offer comprised an all-share offer at an exchange ratio of 13.9 Brave Bison shares for each ordinary share in\nMISSION,\na partial cash alternative of up to 50 per cent. of the potential offer price and the intention to undertake an underwritten share placing to reduce indebtedness of the proposed combined group (the \"\nRevised Possible Offer\n\").\nThe board of\nMISSION\n(\"\nBoard\n\") understands that the amount of such partial cash alternative and the quantum of any proposed reduction in indebtedness for the proposed combined group is not certain and will be determined by Brave Bison following a period of due diligence.\nBased on the terms of the Revised Possible Offer and the closing market prices of\nMISSION\nand Brave Bison shares on 10 May 2024, being the last trading day prior to Brave Bison's 12 May 2024 announcement of the initial possible offer, the Revised Possible Offer values each\nMISSION\nshare at approximately 35 pence1. Were the Revised Possible Offer to be implemented on its indicative terms, prior to any proposed equity fundraising, this would result in\nMISSION's\nshareholders holding approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group.\nOn 6 June 2024, the Board of\nMISSION\n,\nfollowing consultation with its financial advisers and a period of engagement with certain of its shareholders, unanimously rejected the Revised Possible Offer which it believes to be opportunistic and undervalues the Group and its prospects. Moreover, it is dilutive to\nMISSION's\nshareholders as it does not reflect the relevant contributions of each party to the proposed combined group.\nIn that regard, the Board of\nMISSION\nwould like to bring shareholders' attention to the following points:\n\u00b7\nThe Board continues to believe that the Revised Possible Offer does not fully reflect the inherent value in\nMISSION\nwhich, has been reflected in a 62.1 per cent. increase in the\nMISSION\nshare price to 10 May 20243.\n\u00b7\nMoreover, the Board believes that the Revised Possible Offer undervalues the contribution of\nMISSION\nto the proposed combined group. Based on the respective net revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted pre-tax profit contributions of\nMISSION\nand Brave Bison as set out in their respective results for their financial years ending 31 December 2023,\nMISSION\nwould contribute approximately 81 per cent. of revenues, approximately 71 per cent. of adjusted EBITDA and approximately 54 per cent. of adjusted pre-tax profits to the proposed combined group2. The proposed exchange ratio under the terms of the Revised Possible Offer and of\nMISSION's\nshareholders holding approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group does not reflect that contribution.\n\u00b7\nThe proposed holding by\nMISSION\nshareholders of approximately 50 per cent. of the proposed combined group also only represents the position before any potential dilution from the proposed equity fundraising outlined by Brave Bison in its 3 June possible offer announcement. The Board of\nMISSION\nunderstands that, while subject to due diligence, the size of this fundraising is anticipated to be between \u00a310 - 15 million at a price of 2.53 pence per Brave Bison share. Brave Bison has indicated to\nMISSION\nthat the proceeds of the equity fundraising, together with Brave Bison's existing cash (approximately \u00a37 million at 31 December 2023), would be used to deleverage the proposed combined group and to satisfy a cash alternative of up to 17.5 pence per\nMISSION\nshare. Brave Bison's current assumption based on publicly available information is that a minimum of \u00a34 million and a maximum of \u00a310 million would be required to reduce indebtedness, therefore providing between \u00a310 million and \u00a316 million for a cash alternative. The effect of any such equity fundraising could therefore further dilute\nMISSION's\nshareholders' interest in the proposed combined group below the proposed approxima",

Covid is partly responsible of course, but they got carried away with borrowing, and made some acquisitions at the wrong time IMHO.  The old board had learned that being over indebted when things go quiet is dangerous, my buys then at sub 10p were highly risky. Having said that, I don't see the barmily named company as doing anything other than either biting off more than they can chew, or trying to destabilise a rival.  They do have a shareholder with clout, but other than that I can't see any compelling reason to do anything except send them back out on the prairies to graze.  Or \" go eat ***^\"in other words",

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

The share buy-back details take some digesting (deferred by me for now) but on the face of it seem to suggest that TMG will effectively make a market in its own shares when the Board believes the SP is below the net value of the business.  Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

The old board had learned that being over indebted when things go quiet is dangerous, my buys then at sub 10p were highly risky. Having said that, I don't see the barmily named company as doing anything other than either biting off more than they can chew, or trying to destabilise a rival.  They do have a shareholder with clout, but other than that I can't see any compelling reason to do anything except send them back out on the prairies to graze.  Or \" go eat ***^\"in other words",

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

The share buy-back details take some digesting (deferred by me for now) but on the face of it seem to suggest that TMG will effectively make a market in its own shares when the Board believes the SP is below the net value of the business.  Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

The old board had learned that being over indebted when things go quiet is dangerous, my buys then at sub 10p were highly risky. Having said that, I don't see the barmily named company as doing anything other than either biting off more than they can chew, or trying to destabilise a rival.  They do have a shareholder with clout, but other than that I can't see any compelling reason to do anything except send them back out on the prairies to graze.  Or \" go eat ***^\"in other words",

The share buy-back details take some digesting (deferred by me for now) but on the face of it seem to suggest that TMG will effectively make a market in its own shares when the Board believes the SP is below the net value of the business.  Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

It would also load them with fairly sizeable debt which would take some time to pay off, unless they could quickly improve Missions profits.

Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.

Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

Covid is partly responsible of course, but they got carried away with borrowing, and made some acquisitions at the wrong time IMHO.  The old board had learned that being over indebted when things go quiet is dangerous, my buys then at sub 10p were highly risky. Having said that, I don't see the barmily named company as doing anything other than either biting off more than they can chew, or trying to destabilise a rival.  They do have a shareholder with clout, but other than that I can't see any compelling reason to do anything except send them back out on the prairies to graze.  Or \" go eat ***^\"in other words",

The share buy-back details take some digesting (deferred by me for now) but on the face of it seem to suggest that TMG will effectively make a market in its own shares when the Board believes the SP is below the net value of the business.  Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.

The share buy-back details take some digesting (deferred by me for now) but on the face of it seem to suggest that TMG will effectively make a market in its own shares when the Board believes the SP is below the net value of the business.  Could this be, f or example (only), in the region of 40pps? I need to check this out and would welcome the views of others. The value of April6 to TMG seems to be greater as \"cash now\" than the contribution it is making to profits - so a well chosen deal to cash in the goodwill premium - whilst wishing the new owners good fortune in the States.

Looking at the historical SP chart and the detailed reports and accounts suggests that substantial cost savings have already been found and implemented and some hard pruning of the substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet has already taken place.   Until the summer of 2023 the SP hadn't been below 40p (and historically far above that figure). If DM can consolidate a robust profitability throughout the group then the burden of the indebtedness would lighten quickly and give the market confidence and open a range of financing options including perhaps a further share issue.  That at least  would knock out the considerable interest cost being incurred at the moment. Just one month to go for the FY 2024 - so not long to wait to see if the ship has been steadied.
