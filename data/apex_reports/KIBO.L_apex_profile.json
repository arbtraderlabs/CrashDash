The primary resource of the project locations is onshore wind which has the capacity to co-locate Solar PV and Battery Energy Storage Solutions (BESS) to support delivering a firm power solution.\n\u00b7\nThe portfolio's\npotential capacity of over 14 GW\nrepresents a significant opportunity to advance\nclimate change mitigation\n, drive\neconomic growth through job creation\nin both construction and long-term operations, and deliver\ncommunity benefits\nthrough employment and regional revitalization with\nlarge-scale, firmed clean power solutions\nthat will support\ngrid supply, industrial electrification, data centres, critical minerals processing, green steel production, and low-carbon liquid fuels\n.\n\u00b7\nConditions Precedent: Completion of the SPA is conditional upon, inter alia:\no\nPublication of an AIM admission document including audited historical financial information for both Kibo and the Target;\no\nApproval of the Transaction by Kibo shareholders at a General Meeting; and\no\nSuch other standard conditions precedent including, inter alia, completion of satisfactory mutual due diligence by all parties, board approvals, AIM the JSE & other relevant regulatory authority approvals including obtaining a waiver from Irish Takeover Panel where required.\nThe Transaction would qualify as a reverse takeover transaction (\"RTO\") under AIM Rule 14, given the Company's cash shell status. Further details will be set out in the admission document upon completion of the RTO.\nConvertible Loan Note\nThe Company has issued a Convertible Loan Note to an institutional investor\n(the \"Noteholder\") to provide funding to the Company of up to \u00a3150,000 for general working capital purposes and to cover the initial RTO costs (the \"CLN\"). This will allow the Company's Nomad and advisors to start the due diligence process and preparation of the admission document and related documentation. Furthermore, the Company will need to complete a further fundraise, expected to be in the form of a separate Convertible Loan Note, to cover additional working capital requirements and RTO costs. A further announcement will be made when this is finalised.\nThe key terms of the CLN are as follows:\n\u00b7\nMaturity Date: date on which Kibo's shares are re-admitted for trading on AIM following the completion of the RTO\n\u00b7\nZero percent rate of interest\n\u00b7\nConversion Date: convertible on Maturity Date\n\u00b7\nConversion Price: 20% discount to the re-admission price\n\u00b7\nFace value to be, at the election of the Noteholder on Maturity Date:\no\nRepaid in cash; or\no\nConverted into ordinary shares of the Company at the Conversion Price.\nFinancial Reporting Update\nAs previously announced, trading in the Company's ordinary shares on AIM remains suspended pending the completion of a potential RTO, publication of the admission document and re-admission of the Company's shares to trading on AIM.\nThe audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 and the interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2025 will be published together as part of the Company's admission document at the time of re-admission to trading on AIM.\nNext Steps and Timetable\nFollowing the completion of the due diligence process, a General Meeting will be convened to seek shareholder approval in due course. The Company will also be required to undertake a fundraising in connection with the Transaction.\nFurther announcements will be made as appropriate, including in relation to the expected timetable for re-admission.\nWhilst the Company and Vendor are committed to completing the RTO there can be no guarantee that it will complete, and investors should note that completion remains subject to substantial conditions. Furthermore, to complete the required work on the RTO, including due diligence, the Company needs to raise additional funds.\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) no. 596/2014.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit\nwww.kibo.energy\nor contact:\nCobus van der Merwe\ninfo@kibo.energy\nKibo Energy PLC\nChief Executive Officer\nJames Biddle\nRoland Cornish\n+44 207 628 3396\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Sheehan\n+44\n20 7048 9400\nGlobal Investment Strategy UK Limited\nJoint Broker\nBeaumont Cornish Limited ('Beaumont Cornish') is the Company's Nominated Adviser and is authorised and regulated by the FCA.
