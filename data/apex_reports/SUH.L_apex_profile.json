The Company has progressively reduced bank borrowing through the disposal of selected properties, though this has in turn reduced the income earning asset base. The Company is now working actively towards a new financing strategy which will allow the Company to weather the current economic environment, which does not favour new development, whilst supporting the existing trading activities and intensifying interim uses of available assets to provide stable returns and to underpin the quality of the Sutton Harbour location.\"\nEnquiries:\nSutton Harbour Group plc\nPhilip Beinhaker - Executive Chairman\nCorey Beinhaker - Chief Operating Officer\nNatasha Gadsdon - Finance Director\nStrand Hanson Li\nmited\n(Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker)\nJames Dance\nRichard Johnson\nNotes to Editors\nSutton Harbour Group plc (AIM: SUH) is an AIM quoted company specialising in marine operations, waterfront regeneration and destination creation in Plymouth and South West England.\nThe Company operates Sutton Harbour Marina, King Point Marina and Plymouth Fisheries. Operational activities include mixed-use lettings, car parking and support services to harbour users, property management and regeneration and asset enhancement.\nSutton Harbour is committed to being the leading marine and waterfront regeneration specialist in Southern England, and to positioning Sutton Harbour in Plymouth as a destination of national interest.\nInterim Results\nExecutive Chairman's Statement\nFor the six-month period to 30 September 2025\nResults and Financial position\nThe results for the first six months of the financial year (\"H1 2025\" or the \"Period\") reflect trading performance of the Company, which reflect the revenue impact of further assets sales and certain exceptional items. The underlying trading activities of the business have performed steadily. Occupancy of rental properties, excluding those sold, has remained consistent, the marinas results overall are on par with the same period last year, parking results have improved in line with inflationary price increases applied and fisheries trading has stabilised albeit at a lower level than pre FY2024 following the closure in May 2024, at short notice, of the third party company which operated the auction.\nDuring the Period, gross profit declined to \u00a31.259m from \u00a31.328m for the comparable period to 30 September 2024 (\"H1 2024\"), a reduction of \u00a30.069m. The sale of 5 properties between September 2024 and June 2025 has resulted in a material reduction in rental income together with one off accounting adjustments to write off accrued income in the Period. Consequently, real estate trading results show a decline of \u00a30.243m in revenue when compared to the same period last year. Exceptional items, net income of \u00a30.217m (H1 2024: net cost \u00a30.230m), comprise the ongoing legal costs relating to both the lease of Plymouth City Airport and the future maintenance of Sutton Lock, offset by recovery of some past costs previously reported as exceptional costs. The cost of financing continues to be a burden to the Company with net financing expenses of \u00a31.127m incurred in the period (H1 2024: \u00a31.070m). Whilst bank interest payments have reduced following loan repayments and lowering of bank base rates, interest continues to accrue, although not paid, on the increased Related Party Loan creditor. The loss before taxation for the six-month period to 30 September 2025 was reduced to \u00a30.474m compared to \u00a30.825m (loss before taxation) for the comparative period to H1 2024.\nAs at 30 September 2025, net assets were \u00a334.630m (equal to 24.2 pence per share), down from \u00a335.104m (equal to 24.6 pence per share) as at 31 March 2025. The decrease in net assets reflects the loss sustained during the period.\nNet debt has decreased to \u00a326.061m, being \u00a30.748m lower than the net debt position of \u00a326.809m as at 31 March 2025. During H1 2025 bank loan repayments of \u00a32.190m have been made reducing current bank debt to \u00a318.065m whilst related party loans have increased by \u00a30.692m (from \u00a37.354m at 31 March 2025 to \u00a38.046m to 30 September 2025), being an additional \u00a30.315m new loan to fund ongoing working capital needs and \u00a30.377m accrued interest on these loans. Gearig, measured as net debt as a percentage of net assets, has decreased to 75.3% as at 30 September 2025 from 76.4% as at 31 March 2025.\nDebt Reduction Plan\nThe Company continues to progress its plans to reduce debt and refinance the Company. These plans are interrelated and whilst asset sales permit repayments of the bank loan and interest savings, account must also be taken of the fall in contribution of those assets that are income producing. Following the fall in interest rates since the peak in Summer 2024, the Company, together with its bank and advisors, is considering the merits of each prospective asset sale in the context of the effect on the overall Company position. Attention is now being refocused to the sale of non-income producing assets, including development land, in addition to other asset sales where buyer interest is being progressed.\nThe bank facility agreement documents that a further loan repayment of \u00a36.5m is due by 31 March 2026 and the Company remains in regular contact with the bank about progress towards this target. The current banking facility expires in December 2026.\nTrading and Operations Report\nThe Marinas and Car Parks have enjoyed a good summer and early autumn trading period in line with expectations and slightly above last year. In September 2025, the marina team attended Southampton International Boat Show to prepare for 2026/27 season. The selling campaign started in early November 2025 and, to date, approximately half of the current berth-holders have taken up the promotional incentive and have paid in full for the next season, which starts 1 April 2026.\nThe Company continues to liaise with stakeholders of Plymouth Fisheries regarding meaningful opportunities to stimulate activity at the facility. Since the auction closed in May 2024, the Company has maintained services provided to fishermen. Fish landings income declined materially after May 2024 as most fish is now landed directly to other ports. Fuel sales, which initially held up well, have shown some signs of softening in recent months. Demand remains robust for storage and processing space at the fisheries complex.\nDevelopment / Regeneration\nThe Company has paused work in connection with pre planning work and planning submissions for new development and/or redevelopment of existing sites. Against a backdrop of weak demand at a national and local level, funding constraints and viability concerns in the current market, this decision has been made to conserve resources and to reconsider interim and future options for assets and buildings, as also referred to above in 'Debt Reduction Plan'.\nExceptional items\nThere is no update to report on the claim made by Plymouth City Council in respect of the lease of the former airport site. This matter remains active but progress has been very slow. The costs attributable to this matter amounted to \u00a30.194m in H1 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a30.070m costs).\n\u00a30.411m net income (H1 2024: \u00a30.160m net cost) is also recorded as an exceptional item, being the ongoing legal costs, net of cost recovery, which relate to the maintenance of Sutton Lock, in line with disclosure in previous periods.\nThe Company is restricted from providing further detailed information about either of these matters due to the legal restrictions in place.\nSummary\nThe Company's strategy to create value through the profitable development of sites under its ownership has been set back by economic factors undermining the viability of new building. The Company has progressively reduced bank borrowing through the disposal of selected properties, though this has in turn reduced the income earning asset base. The Company is now working actively towards a new financing strategy which will allow the Company to weather the current economic environment, which does not favour new development, whilst supporting the existing trading activities and intensifying interim uses of available assets to provide stable returns and to underpin the quality of the Sutton Harbour location.\nPhilip Beinhaker\nEXECUTIVE

information does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 25th September 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified and did not contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\nCopies of the Group's financial statements are available from the Company's registered office, Ground Floor, 2b North East Quay, Sutton Harbour, Plymouth, England, PL4 0BN and on the Company's website www.sutton-harbour.co.uk.\nThis consolidated interim financial information has not been audited.\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and those parts of the Companies Acts 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nAccounting policies\nExcept as described below, the accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, as described in those annual financial statements.\nAccounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nSegment information\nManagement has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used to make strategic decisions.\nThe Board of Directors considers the business from an operational perspective as having only one geographical segment, with all operations being carried out in the United Kingdom.\nThe Board of Directors considers the performance of the operating segments using operating profit. The segment information provided to the Board of Directors for the reportable segments for the period ended 30 September 2025 is as follows:\n6 months to 30 September 2025\nMarine\nReal Estate\nCar Parking\nRegeneration\nReal Estate Disposal\nTotal\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRevenue\n2,879\n457\n592\n-\n2,675\n6,603\nGross profit prior to non-recurring items\n750\n150\n370\n(11)\n-\n1,259\n1,259\nUnallocated:\nAdministrative expenses\n(823)\nExceptional items\n217\nOperating profit from continuing operations\n653\nFinancial income\n1\nFinancial expense\n(1,128)\nLoss before tax from continuing operations\n(474)\nTaxation\n-\nLoss for the year from continuing operations\n(474)\nDepreciation charge\nMarine\n150\nCar Parking\n6\nAdministration\n-\n156\nSegment Information\n(continued)\n6 months to 30 September 2024\nMarine\nReal Estate\nCar Parking\nRegeneration\nTotal\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRevenue\n3,075\n703\n567\n-\n4,345\nGross profit prior to non-recurring items\n681\n393\n334\n(80)\n1,328\n1,328\nUnallocated:\n(853)\nAdministrative expenses\n(230)\nOperating profit from continuing operations\n245\nFinancial income\n2\nFinancial expense\n(1,072)\nProfit before tax from continuing operations\n(825)\nTaxation\n-\nProfit for the year from continuing operations\n(825)\nDepreciation charge\nMarine\n188\nCar Parking\n7\nAdministration\n-\n195\nSegment Information\n(continued)\nYear ended 31 March 2025\nMarine\nReal Estate\nReal Estate Disposals\nCar Parking\nRegeneration\nTotal\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRevenue\n5,461\n1,291\n1,525\n963\n-\n9,240\nSegmental Gross Profit before Fair value adjustment and unallocated expenses\nDevelopment inventory impairment\n1,024\n690\n(105)\n516\n(453)\n(13,019)\n1,672\n(13,019)\nFair value adjustment on investment properties and fixed assets\n-\n(3,309)\n-\n-\n(3,309)\nSegmental Profit\n1,024\n(2,619)\n(105)\n516\n(13,019)\n(14,656)\nUnallocated:\nAdministrative expenses\n(1,484)\nE\nxceptional items\n(504)\nOperating loss\n(1,988)\nFinancial income\n5\nFinancial expense\n(2,082)\nLoss before tax from continuing activities\n(18,721)\nTaxation\n1,910\nLoss for the year from continuing operations\n(16,811)\nDepreciation charge\nMarine\n336\nParking\n13\nAdministration\n-\n349\n30 September 2025\n30 September 2024\n31 March\n2025\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nSegment assets:\nMarine\n26,143\n28,656\n25,803\nReal estate\n12,818\n18,724\n15,451\nCar Parking\n6,688\n8,232\n6,464\nRegeneration\n18,626\n31,201\n18,472\nTotal segment assets\n64,275\n86,813\n66,190\nUnallocated assets:\nProperty, plant and equipment\n30\n30\n33\nTrade & other receivables\n236\n244\n171\nCash & cash equivalents\n263\n572\n1,034\nTotal assets\n64,804\n87,659\n67,428\nSegment Information\n(continued)\n30 September 2025\n30 September 2024\n31 March\n2025\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nSegment liabilities:\nMarine\n1,593\n1,724\n2,494\nReal estate\n369\n529\n375\nCar Parking\n250\n92\n42\nRegeneration\n1,123\n976\n1,122\nTotal segment liabilities\n3,335\n3,321\n4,033\nUnallocated liabilities:\nBank overdraft & borrowings\n26,324\n27,888\n27,843\nTrade & other payables\n514\n544\n446\nTax payable\n1\n1\n2\nDeferred tax liabilities\n-\n2,639\n-\nTotal liabilities\n30,174\n34,393\n32,324\nUnallocated assets included in total assets and unallocated liabilities included in total liabilities are not split between segments as these items are centrally managed.\nTaxation\nThe Company has applied an effective tax rate of 25% (2024: 25%) based on management's best estimate of the tax rate expected for the full financial year.\nDividends\nThe Board of Directors do not propose an interim dividend (2024: nil).\nEarnings per share\n6 months to\n30 September\n2025\n(unaudited)\npence\n6 months to\n30 September\n2024\n(unaudited)\npence\nYear Ended\n31 March\n2025\n(audited)\npence\nContinuing operations\nBasic (loss)/earnings per share\n(0.33p)\n(0.58p)\n(11.76p)\nDiluted (loss)/earnings per share*\n(0.33p)\n(0.58p)\n(11.76p)\nBasic Earnings per Share:\nBasic earnings per share have been calculated using the loss for the period of \u00a3474,000 (6 months ended 30 September 2025: loss \u00a3825,000; year ended 31 March 2025: loss \u00a316,811,000). The average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding those options granted under the HMRC approved CSOP scheme, of 142,938,478 (2024: 142,938,478; year ended 31 March 2025: 142,938,478) has been used in our calculation.\nDiluted Earnings per Share:\nDiluted earnings per share uses a weighted average number of 143,196,450 (30 September 2024: 143,196,450 ; 31 March 2025: 143,196,450) ordinary shares after adjusting for the effects of share options in issue: 257,972 ordinary shares (2025: 257,972; year ended 31 March 2025). If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share.\nProperty valuation\nFreehold land and buildings and investment property have been independently valued by Jones Lang LaSalle as at 31 March 2025, in accordance with the Practice Statements in the Valuations Standards (The Red Book) published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.\nA further valuation will be commissioned for the year ending 31 March 2026, as in previous years.\nCash and cash equivalents\nAs at\n30 September 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3000\nAs at\n30 September 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3000\nAs at\n31 March 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3000\nCash and cash equivalents per balance sheet and cash flow statement\n263\n572\n1,034\nCash flow statements\n6 months to\n30 September 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3000\n6 months to\n30 September 2024\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3000\nYear Ended\n31 March 2025\n(audited)\n\u00a3000\nCash flows from operating activities\n(Loss) for the period\n(474)\n(825)\n(16,811)\nAdjustments for:\nLoss on disposal\n-\n-\n105\nTaxation\n-\n-\n(1,910)\nFinancial income\n(1)\n(2)\n(5)\nFinancial expense\n1,128\n1,072\n2,082\nFair value adjustment on investment property\nRevaluation of property, plant and equipment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,460\n1,848\nDepreciation\n156\n195\n349\nCash generated from operations before changes in working capital and provisions\n809\n440\n(12,882)\n(Increase)/ Decrease in inventories\n(138)\n(370)\n12,352\n(Increase)/ Decrease trade and other receivables\n(780)\n(193)\n198\nIncrease/(Decrease) in trade and other payables\n347\n(114)\n(561)\n(Decrease)/Increase in deferred income\n(977)\n(968)\n19\nCash generated from operations\n(739)\n(1,205)\n(874)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The board notes the impact of asset sales achieved to date, the result being a material decline in rental revenue mostly offset by the savings in interest, after payments to reduce the bank loan.\n\u00b7\nMaintenance of Sutton Lock\nThe Company is in continuing discussions with the Environment Agency about maintenance of the Sutton Harbour lock. The Company has successfully recovered part of the professional costs incurred to determine the operation of certain clauses within the lock operating agreement. These costs had been recorded as exceptional costs in the financial statements for years ended 31 March 2024 and 2025. The cost recovery is realised in the first half year to 30 September 2025.\n\u00b7\nMarinas\nTrading has been steady at both marinas throughout the season with revenues on par with the previous year. Marketing for the 2026/27 season has started and a material number of berth-holders have taken advantage of the loyalty discount scheme with fees already paid in full. Pricing for the forthcoming season has been set at a level to encourage rebooking as the market becomes more competitive.\n\u00b7\nInvestment Property and Car Parking\nOccupancy of let property remains has remained consistent throughout the financial year to date. Car parking revenues show increases in line with price rises implemented in April 2025.\n\u00b7\nPlymouth Fisheries\nPlymouth Fisheries continues to maintain facilities for the use of fishers, albeit that there is no longer an auction held at Plymouth, due to its closing by the former operator. Fish landed continues to be transported overland for auction. Stakeholders continue to liaise on needs to assure the future of facilities that meet the needs of the industry. Following the decline in landings after the auction closed in May 2024, Fisheries revenues have stabilised but at a new lower level.\n\u00b7\nFuture New Development\nDemand for both high quality luxury waterfront residential property and commercial development is currently subdued, reflecting both the national and southwest regional economies. The Board has therefore decided to pause expenditure on the new developments until the future is more assured and the market recovers. To improve revenue and to reduce property holding costs, opportunities for interim uses of vacant sites are currently under consideration and retained property agents are instructed to market this availability.\n\u00b7\nFormer Airport Site\nThe Company continues to engage with Plymouth City Council over the future of the former airport site but, as noted in my report in September 2025, is unable to provide further details due to the legal restrictions in place.\nThe Interim Results for the 6-month period to 30 September 2025 are due to be published in December 2025.\nEnquiries:\nSutton Harbour Group plc\nPhilip Beinhaker - Executive Chairman\nCorey Beinhaker - Chief Operating Officer\nNatasha Gadsdon - Finance Director\n+44 (0) 1752 204186\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker)\nJames Dance\nRichard Johnson\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nNotes to Editors\nSutton Harbour Group plc (AIM: SUH) is an AIM quoted company specialising in marine operations, waterfront regeneration and destination creation in Plymouth and South West England.\nThe Company operates Sutton Harbour Marina, King Point Marina and Plymouth Fisheries.

Improvements to Sutton Harbour Marina have been successfully completed to uphold the quality of the facility and to protect revenue. Completion of asset disposals that are currently in hand will allow the management team more time to work on new projects focused upon the regeneration and operations of the core Sutton Harbour asset.\"\nRelated Party Loan Extension\nOn 25 September 2025, the Company extended the existing related party loan finance, originally announced on 27 April 2022 and updated most recently on 1 April 2025, by \u00a3315,000 to provide additional headroom in the Company's cash resources, until targeted property disposals are completed, bringing the total shareholder loan facilities to \u00a36.605m.

The Loans carry a fixed 8% gross annual interest rate with the option, at the discretion of the Company, to capitalise some or all of the interest at a fixed 10% annual interest rate. The repayment of the Loan, previously repayable in equal portions no earlier than each of 31 August 2025, 31 November 2025 and 28 February 2026, has been amended such that the Loan is now repayable in equal portions no earlier than\u00a0each of 31 March 2026, 31 May 2026 and 31 August 2026.\nThe Loan extension and repayment variation constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of the AIM Rules, as BDSL represents 56% of the holdings of FB Investors LLP, which has a 75.38% holding in the Company, and is controlled by the Beinhaker family. The directors, other than Philip Beinhaker and Corey Beinhaker, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Strand Hanson, consider that the terms of Loan extension and repayment variation are fair and reasonable insofar as shareholders are concerned.\nBank Facility Amendment\nNational Westminster Bank plc has agreed to a further extension to the repayment dates of the Company's bank loan to allow asset sales to complete and additional bank loan repayments to be made. Further to the Company's announcements of 21 March 2024, 20 January 2025 and 1 July 2025, the amended bank loan agreement requires \u00a36.5m to be repaid by 31 March 2026, thereby reducing the bank loan to \u00a311.565m from the disposal of assets. The facility's maturity date remains as 30 December 2026.\nFor further information, please contact\n:\nSutton Harbour Group plc\nPhilip Beinhaker - Executive ChairmanCorey Beinhaker - Chief Operating OfficerNatasha Gadsdon - Finance Director\n+44 (0) 1752 204186\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker)\nRichard JohnsonRob PatrickImogen Ellis\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nPage number references in this announcement refer to the Annual Report, available as set out above on the Company's website.\nExecutive Chairman's Statement\nIntroduction\nTrading performance during the year under review has been mixed reflecting a number of challenges faced during the year. Car parking has continued strongly, berthing levels at the marinas remained steady, property tenancies performed reliably and fisheries activity suffered after the closure of the long standing third party auctioneer company.\nThe Company's priority for the past financial year has been to market a number of assets for sale to permit repayments of the bank loan. Progress with this programme is reported later in this statement. Completions on sales achieved to date and offers for other assets have been taken into account in the annual valuation resulting in valuation deficits in many of the portfolio assets. The Company has found the sales market for specialised commercial property assets more difficult than expected. The timing of disposals during a period of ongoing higher interest rates and economic uncertainty has had a dampening effect on demand and the prices that can be obtained.\nThe Company has plans, some of which have been previously consented, to redevelop a number of its properties and the carrying value of development inventory has been reviewed, as is done each year. Based on latest market information, expected deliverability in current conditions and expiry of some planning consents, the board has decided to impair a number of projects (with independent professional input where required) which has resulted in a material reduction in the carrying value of project inventory. Further information is given later in this report.\nThe Company has continued to resource, at considerable cost and time, two legal matters, one concerning the management of Sutton Lock and the other concerning the lease of Plymouth City Airport. The costs of these matters are separately disclosed as exceptional items. Due to legal restrictions the Company is currently unable to disclose further detail about these matters although information has been made available to the Company's auditors to ensure reporting of the Company's position is fair.\nThe results for the year are therefore depressed by the non-cash impairment adjustments to investment, trading and development properties together with the mixed trading performance across different activities, exceptional costs of legal matters and ongoing high interest costs.\nResults and Financial Position\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n2025\n2024\nNet Assets\n\u00a335.104m\n\u00a354.091m\nNet Asset value per share\n24.6p\n37.8p\n(Loss) before tax from continuing operations\n(\u00a318.721m)\n(\u00a34.385m)\nAdjusted (loss) before tax excluding fair value adjustments and exceptional items*\n(\u00a31.889m)\n(\u00a33.330m)\n(Loss) after tax\n(\u00a316.811m)\n(\u00a33.836m)\nBasic (loss) after tax per share\n(11.76p)\n(2.71p)\nDividend per share\n0.0p\n0.0p\nTotal Comprehensive loss for the year attributable to shareholders\n(\u00a318.987m)\n(\u00a34.878m)\nTotal Comprehensive loss per share\n(13.3p)\n(3.4p)\nNet Debt\n\u00a326.809m\n\u00a324.805m\nGearing (Net Debt/Net Assets)\n76.4%\n45.9%\n*Fair value adjustments of \u00a32.905m relate to revaluations of investment property and owner occupied property where there is a reduction in fair value and no previous surplus in the revaluation reserve (see note 14 and 15) and exceptional items of \u00a30.504m (2024: \u00a30.855m) (see note 10).\nGross profit for the year was \u00a31.672m compared to \u00a30.004m in the previous year.\nThe exceptional cost of \u00a30.504m (2024: \u00a30.855m) was incurred for legal costs in connection with future lock management costs and the airport lease (see note 10).\nNet debt (including lease liabilities) increased to \u00a326.809m as at 31 March 2025 from \u00a324.805m at 31 March 2024, up by \u00a32.004m. The key movements in net debt during the year include a repayment of the bank loan of \u00a31.445m and an increase in related party loan financing (including rolled up interest) of \u00a33.479m.\nGearing (net debt/net assets) as at 31 March 2025 stood at 76.4% (31 March 2024: 45.9%). Net finance costs of \u00a32.077m in the year (2024: \u00a31.992m) are stated after capitalisation of interest of \u00a30.279m (2024: \u00a30.427m).\nAs at 31 March 2025, net assets were \u00a335.104m (31 March 2024: \u00a354.091m), a net asset value of 24.6p per ordinary share (31 March 2024: 37.8p per ordinary share). The reduction in net assets of \u00a318.987m includes the valuation adjustment of the Group's property portfolio and property development assets amounting to a reduction of \u00a319.233m as shown in the table below. Valuations for assets obtained from independent professional valuers have been informed by prices obtained for recent property disposals by the Company and offers received for asset.

Finance drawdown of \u00a3213,000.\nThe Company has suffered the ongoing pressure of high interest rates during the year and delays to dispose of property in a difficult market have resulted in the bank loan remaining higher than expected. Interest costs have consequently remained a burden to the Company. During the year the Company has successfully sought a number of facility amendments from its bankers to defer debt repayments to allow more time for property asset disposals to complete.\nAfter the year end the Company repaid a further \u00a32.190m against the bank loan following disposals of another two properties. This reduced the bank loan to \u00a318.065m.\nIn June 2025 the Company secured a further facility amendment from the bank to extend the date for repayment of \u00a36.5m to September 2025 and in September 2025 a further extension until 31 March 2026 was agreed. Once this repayment is made, the Company will have reduced the bank loan to \u00a311.6m as required by the bank.\nThe Company met all operable bank covenants during the year.\nAs at 31 March 2025, related party loans, including rolled up interest owed to shareholders, were as follows:\n2025\n\u00a3\n2024\n\u00a3\nBeinhaker Design Services Limited\n\u00a37.110m\n\u00a32.530m\nRotolok (Holdings) Limited\n\u00a30.246m\n\u00a31.345m\nTotal\n\u00a37.346m\n\u00a33.875m\nThe majority shareholder has continued to support the Company and has made new related party loans of \u00a32.885m during the year to permit normal company operations, progress with key projects, bank interest payments and the costs of legal actions underway. In due course, asset disposals are expected to release some cash for working capital after bank loan repayments are met. After the year end, the majority shareholder advanced new related party loans totalling \u00a30.315m.\nTaking into account the performance of the Company and the current level of bank borrowing, the board does not recommend payment of a dividend on the year's results.\nDirectors and Staff\nHeadcount as at 31 March 2025 was 30 (31 March 2024: 30), excluding Non-Executive Directors.\nAfter the year end, having given notice of his intention to step down from the board, Graham Miller retired on 30 June 2025. The Directors thank Graham for his wise counsel to board over the last twelve years which included five years as Chairman until 2018.\nThe board is pleased to report that on 1 July 2025 Paul Shackleton was appointed as Non-Executive Director.\nPaul is an experienced London based corporate finance adviser and broker who, since 1996, has specialised in both domestic and international AIM traded companies, including advising companies in the role of Nominated Adviser. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience, particularly in transactions, fund raising, Corporate Governance and Regulation. He is currently the Non-Executive Chairman of GCM Resources plc and a Non-Executive Director of Rurelec plc.\u00a0Paul is familiar with the Company, having previously advised the board on corporate and regulatory matters, and also takes on the roles of Audit Committee Chairman and Senior Independent Director. Paul will stand for election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting.\nOperations Report\nMarine\nMarinas\nBoth marinas traded steadily during the year with gross berthing revenues 2% ahead of the previous year. Occupancy of the marinas declined very slightly which was offset by inflationary prices rises. Following a temporary relocation of the Sutton Harbour Marina office and temporary deployment of a Portakabin shower and toilet unit, the Company worked to have new permanent facilities in place before the start of the 2025/26 season which started on 1 April 2025. In February 2025, a new reception area, offices and crew room was completed and opened, taking space in a long term vacant unit owned by the Group, and the new floating shower and toilet facility was installed. Both new facilities significantly upgrade the customer experience and have been well received by berthholders.\nThe King Point Marina is one of the assets being marketed for sale which is being actively progressed having attracted some interest.. The preferred bidder is advancing due diligence work and further updates to shareholders will be made as appropriate.\nThe majority of berthing sales for the marinas are made in the pre-season selling period which operates through November and December. Ahead of this, the Group has noticed a slight softening in demand for the 2025/26 season with some berth holders deterred by the ongoing sales process at King Point Marina and others at Sutton Harbour Marina uncertain about the facilities renewal, which were not in place during the key selling period. The marina team attended the 2025 Southampton International Boat Show to promote Sutton Harbour Marina for the first time in recent years.\nFisheries\nThe activity level at Plymouth Fisheries has settled to a reduced level following the shock closure in May 2024 of the third party firm which operated the fish auction and other services. It has not been possible to re-establish the auction, to date, and auctioning of fish has consolidated to other ports in the South West. A significantly reduced number of fish are now landed at Plymouth and transported by road to other ports and accordingly landing fees at Plymouth Fisheries have decreased. Landings of shellfish and other non quota species are still landed at Plymouth Fisheries. Despite this change, fuel sales have remained almost exactly on par with the previous year which the Company still charges competitive rates. Demand for rental units at Plymouth Fisheries remains robust, with any vacancies soon filled.\nThe Company is currently working together with the Local Authority and industry stakeholders on future options for the port. In the meantime, the Company continues to support the operations at Plymouth Fisheries which are currently loss making on account of a fixed operating cost base that cannot be readily streamlined without a decision about the future operating model.\nReal Estate and Car Parks\nReal Estate\nTenant occupancy by 31 March 2025 stood at 85% (31 March 2024 89%). During the year, North Quay House became fully vacant. This is reflected in the slight fall in the occupancy rate. Three properties were sold during the third quarter and one vacant property was refurbished for use by the Company as a marina reception and office. The Company's investment properties are well let to a variety of tenants and excluding North Quay House, just one larger unit remains vacant and is being marketed for sale. Regeneration plans for the site are detailed further below.\nCar Parks\nThe car parks have continued to trade robustly, particularly in the first half of the year which is a stronger season as the car parks are located close to the National Marine Aquarium, the harbour and waterfront.\nRegeneration\nHarbour Arch Quay\nFollowing the completion and sale of all 14 apartments in 2024, the ground floor office space was completed early in the financial year and the Company's head office took up occupation in July 2024.\nNorth Quay House\nThe Company has successfully completed the 'pre-application' phase of the planning process after having submitted a proposal to convert the existing vacant office building into ten high quality apartments and three commercial units together with car parking space. The Company is currently obtaining costings ready to market the development opportunity for sale or joint venture. The development is targeted for delivery during 2026.\nSugar Quay\nA new lower density scheme is being designed to improve prospects for financing and market absorption in what is a difficult market. The scheme will be submitted to 'Pre-Application' during 2025. As a result of reduced density aspirations for the site, compared to the previously consented block of c. 150-170 apartments, the carrying value of the site has been reviewed and impaired by \u00a39.388m, reflecting a site currently without planning consent but in a prominent waterfront location. The Company has previously secured a number of consents for different schemes for the site, the costs of which had been capitalised, and the site has foundations for a previously aborted scheme. These costs accounted for a higher carrying cost, which was previously judged recoverable with a high density development when prevailing economic and sales market conditions were more favourable.\nFormer Airport Site - Planning\nWork to support the Pre Application process for the masterplan of the site has continued and expert planning and technical advice has been sought during the year to assist ongoing discussions with the Local Planning Authority. Local politicians continue to voice their support for aviation at the site, even though no financially substantiated proposals have been put forward in over 13.5 years since the facility closed in December 2011. The Company remains committed to its view that the greatest benefit from the site can be derived from redevelopment for housing (affordable and market), institutional uses and business space. The 113 acre site is surrounded by residential areas and businesses and is well served by established highway and urban infrastructure. The site is, however, very constrained as an aviation site. In the meantime, the Company continues to maintain and secure the site, which has been and is a major undertaking and cost burden. The Company continues to engage with the Local Authority with regard to the provisions of the long lease.\nFinancial Position and Outlook\nThe Company has not been able to progress the financial restructuring plan to the extent it had expected, having targeted to have completed the disposals of assets by the third quarter of the year under review. The ongoing high interest rates have impacted demand for specialised commercial property and prospective purchasers have repeatedly cited difficulties and slowness to secure funding to allow transactions to progress.\nThe Company's bankers and related party funders have been understanding of the current position whilst also being closely briefed on the progress with each asset disposal and have agreed to extend the dates for agreed loan repayments to take account of delays with disposals. Based on current progress with the disposals programme, the Company does not anticipate that the bank loan will be reduced to the target of \u00a311.6m by 30 September 2025.\nThe sales of good yielding assets is progressively eroding profitability as interest saved is lower than the relevant contributions. The Company has engaged professional advisors with the objective of establishing options and putting place funding facilities which best meet the Company's current and future needs.\nSummary\nAgainst a backdrop of challenges presented by the macroeconomic environment, managing claims by third parties and suffering a major change to operations at Plymouth Fisheries, the Company has continued to make progress with pre-planning work on key projects to provide opportunities for value realisation when conditions allow. Improvements to Sutton Harbour Marina have been successfully completed to uphold the quality of the facility and to protect revenue. Completion of asset disposals that are currently in hand will allow the management team more time to work on new projects focused upon the regeneration and operations of the core Sutton Harbour asset.\nPhilip Beinhaker\nEXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN\n25 September 2025\nConsolidated Income Statement for\nthe year ended 31 March

Group accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe Group financial statements consolidate those of the Group and its subsidiaries.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted IAS, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.\nJudgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have\nsignificant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment\nin the next year are discussed in note 4 to these financial statements.\nChanges in accounting policies and disclosures\nThere are no new accounting standards this year. There are no changes to accounting standards expected in the coming 12 months that would have a material impact on the accounts.\nGoing concern\nThe review of the Group's business activities is set out in the Executive Chairman's Report on pages 4 to 7. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and financing position are described in the Financial Review on pages 11 and 12. In addition, note 3 to the financial statements gives details of the Group's financial risk management.\nThe Group is reliant on bank finance which is conditional on the debt reductions and other covenants. The Group's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably foreseeable possible changes in trading performance and on the basis that asset disposals meet the values and timelines agreed with the bank, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of the facilities and covenants over a period of at least twelve months from the date of the approval of the accounts. The covenants measure interest cover, debt to fair value and capital expenditure.\nWithin the next 12 months, the Group has the following commitments to repayments of loans:\n\u00b7\nThe Group's banking facility with Natwest agreed on 8 August 2024 extends to 30 December 2026. This agreement (together with subsequent amendments) provides committed facilities of \u00a320.255m (as at 31 March 2025) and sets out milestone debt repayments of \u00a30.810m by 30 June 2025, \u00a31.380m by 30 July 2025 and \u00a36.50m by 31 March 2026 to reduce bank debt to \u00a311.6m. The interest cover covenant is suspended until 30 June 2026. Thereafter it is tested on a quarterly basis.\n\u00b7\nThe debt reduction plan, through the sale of assets, is underway and the bank is regularly updated on the progress with selected assets placed for sale. Selection of assets identified for disposal will be based on market conditions and progress is being made towards the target debt level of \u00a311.6m 31 March 2026, to date, progress is encouraging. The board recognises the challenges that the Group faces to deliver the debt reduction plan to satisfy the conditions of the banking facility agreement. The board is satisfied that all necessary actions are being taken to achieve this objective, whilst recognising the uncertainty that will remain until asset sales, the timings of which are not within the Group's control, are achieved.\n\u00b7\nThe related party loans advanced by the majority shareholder of the parent company are repayable no earlier than 31 March 2026 under the current agreement. The Directors are satisfied that these repayments can be funded from the actions noted above, and the majority shareholder has confirmed that it will agree to deferment if necessary.\nThe Board has explored options available to it to mitigate the risk of asset sales not completing in line with the agreed milestone debt repayments. These mitigating actions are considered significant judgements and have been disclosed in note 4. The Board has concluded that, whilst there are uncertainties, the mitigating actions that could be implemented if required are judged to be sufficient to make the going concern status of the group appropriate. The Board has therefore concluded that there are no\nmaterial uncertainties relating to events or conditions that individually or collectively may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nMeasurement convention\nThe financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis as modified by the fair value of property except for investment property which is measured at fair value and land and buildings which are measured at revalued amount.\nThe functional currency of the Group and its subsidiaries is pounds sterling and therefore balances are shown in the financial statements in thousands of pounds sterling, unless otherwise stated.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Sutton Harbour Group plc and its subsidiaries at each reporting date. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\nIntra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised profits and losses are also eliminated.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is divided into the following classes:\nLand and buildings\nAssets in the course of construction\nPlant, machinery and equipment\nFixtures and fittings\nLand and buildings\nLand and buildings include:\n- Freehold and leasehold land. Where a lease has an unexpired term of more than 50 years it is considered to share the same characteristics as freehold land and is shown as such.\n- Properties that are mainly owner-occupied, or that are an integral part of the Group's trading operations (marinas including the lock, quays, marina buildings, the fish market building and car parks).\nOwner occupied assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently revalued and stated at their fair values. Fair value is based on regular valuations by an external independent valuer and is determined from market-based evidence by appraisal. Valuations are performed with sufficient regularity (annually) to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying amount.\nWhere owner occupied assets (such as marinas, the fish market and car parks) comprise land, buildings, plant and machinery the valuation is of the asset as a whole. Any valuation movement is allocated to land and buildings; plant and machinery continue to be carried at cost less accumulated depreciation (see below).\nAny revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a decrease in the carrying value of the same asset previously recognised in the income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation deficits are recognised in the income statement, except to the extent of any existing surplus in respect of that asset in the revaluation reserve.\nAssets in the course of construction\nAssets in the course of construction are held at cost. Depreciation commences when the asset is capable of being operated as intended.\nPlant, machinery and equipment, fixtures and fittings\nPlant, machinery and equipment includes items used in the operation of marina, fish market and car park trading operations (such as pontoons, piles, ice making equipment and chillers, car parking meters). Fixtures and fittings includes building fit outs. Plant, machinery and equipment, fixtures and fittings are all stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.\nLeased assets\nLeased assets acquired are stated initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and useful economic life. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of lease liabilities so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement. Leased properties are subsequently revalued to their fair value.\nThe treatment of assets where the lessor maintains the risks and rewards of ownership is described in the lease payments accounting policy below.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant, machinery and equipment, fixtures and fittings. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Where parts of an item of property, plant, machinery and equipment, fixtures and fittings have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives and depreciation basis of assets are as follows:\nFreehold buildings (straight line) 10 to 50 years\nLeasehold buildings (straight line) 50 years or remaining period of lease\nPlant, machinery and equipment (straight line) 4 to 30 years\nFixtures and fittings (straight line) 4 to 10 years\nInvestment property\nInvestment properties are properties which are held to earn rental income and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties are initially measured at cost and subsequently revalued to fair value which reflects market conditions at the balance sheet date. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Fair value is the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged, on the date of valuation, between a willing buyer and a willing seller, in an arm's length transaction, after proper marketing, in which both parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.\nSome properties are held both to earn rental income and for the supply of goods and services and administration purposes. Where the different portions of the property cannot be sold separately, the property is accounted for as an investment property only if an insignificant portion is held for the production and supply of goods and services and administration purposes.\nThe portfolio is valued on an annual basis by an external independent valuer, who is RICS qualified. The valuer will also have recent experience in the location and category of property being valued.\nThe valuations, which are supported by market evidence, are prepared by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable from the properties and where relevant, associated costs. A yield which reflects the specific risks inherent in the net cash flows is then applied to the net annual rentals to arrive at the property valuation.\nRental income from investment property is accounted for as described in the revenue accounting policy.\nInvestment property that is redeveloped for continued future use as an investment property remains classified as an investment property while the redevelopment is being carried out. While redevelopment is taking place, the property will continue to be valued on the same basis as an investment property where the Group intends to retain the property.\nAll tenant leases have been examined to determine if there has been any transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership from the Group to the tenant in accordance with IFRS 16 'Leases'. All tenant leases were determined to be operating leases. Accordingly, all the Group's leased properties are classified as investment properties and included in the balance sheet at fair value.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. Where inventory has been transferred from fixed assets, deemed cost includes revaluation. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\nInventories - development property\nLand identified for development and sale, and properties under construction or development and held for resale, are included in non-current or current assets, depending on the estimated time of ultimate realisation, at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all expenditure related directly to specific projects, including capitalised interest, and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred in the Group's contract activities based on normal operating capacity. Net realisable value is estimated selling value less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale and includes developer's return where applicable.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash in the balance sheet comprises cash at bank and in hand. Bank overdrafts and similar borrowings that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Offset arrangements across Group businesses are applied to arrive at the net cash figure.\nImpairment\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's assets other than\ninvestment property and inventories are considered at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount it is impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.\nInterest-bearing borrowings\nInterest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.\nRevenue\nRevenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value-added-tax, rebates and discounts. Revenue is recognised in accordance with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers (i.e. when the customer gain control of ownership that has been transferred). The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:\nRent and marina and berthing fees\nRent from investment property and marina and berthing fees are typically invoiced in advance and are accounted for as deferred income and recorded to revenue during the period to which the tenant had control of the service.\nLease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over the lease term. These are held in the balance sheet within accrued income.\nOther marine related revenue\nFuel sales, landing dues and other ancillary incomes, are recorded to revenue on the transfer of goods to the customer.\nCar park revenue\nCar park revenue is recognised at the point that a car parking ticket is paid for, normally a maximum of one day's parking. Where seasonal parking permits are sold for longer periods the income is spread over the period the permit relates to.\nProperty sales\nRevenue from property sales is recognised when effective control of the asset has passed to the buyer. This will be at the point of legal completion.\nInterest income\nInterest income is recognised as it becomes receivable.\nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that the Group will comply with all conditions associated with the grant. Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to reduce the initial carrying value of the related asset. Grants of a revenue nature are credited to a deferred income account and released to the income statement so as to match them with the expenditure to which they relate.\nLease payments\nThe Directors have considered the application of IFRS 16 on its leasing arrangements. The Group has a small number of short term leases and leases of low value items and therefore continues to recognise payments made under these agreements on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\nNet financing costs\nNet financing costs comprise interest payable, commitment fees on unused portion of bank facilities, amortisation of prepaid bank facility arrangement fees, unwinding of discount on provisions, finance charge component of minimum lease payments and interest receivable on funds invested. Interest payable and interest receivable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, unless capitalised as described under \"borrowing costs\" below, using the effective interest method.\nBorrowing costs\nBorrowing costs are capitalised on qualifying assets. A qualifying asset is one that takes more than twelve months to complete. The borrowing rate applied is that specifically applied to fund the development. In the case of bank borrowings this is the weighted average cost of debt capital. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the property ready for use are complete and is paused when a project pauses.\nEmployee benefits: defined contribution plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.\nEmployee benefits: share-based payment transactions\nThe share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Group; these awards are granted by the Group. The share-based payments are all equity-settled and are measured at fair value. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.\nProvisions\nA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\nTaxation\nTax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.\nDeferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences except on the initial recognition of goodwill or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.\nSegment reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and whose results are regularly reviewed by the Board.\nThe following operating segments have been identified:\nMarine\nReal Estate\nCar Parking\nRegeneration\nRevenue included within each segment is as follows:\nMarine:\nMarina and commercial berthing fees\nFishmarket landing dues\nOther marine related revenue including fuel sales and other ancillary income\nCar Parking:\nCar park revenue\nReal Estate:\nRent\nRegeneration:\nProperty sales\nCosts, assets and liabilities are allocated to each business segment based on the revenue that they are used to generate.\nTrade Receivables\nTrade receivables are initially measured at the transaction price less impairment. In measuring the impairment, the Group has applied the simplified approach to expected credit losses as permitted by IFRS9. Expected credit losses are assessed by considering the Group's historical credit loss experience, factors specific for each receivable, the current economic climate and expected changes in forecasts of future events. Changes in expected credit losses are recognised in the Group income statement.\nTrade Payables\nTrade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.\n3. Financial risk management\nFair values\nIFRS 13 requires disclosure of fair value measurements for balance sheet financial instruments by level according to the following measurement hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices; and\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\nThe Group does not hold any Level 1 balance sheet financial instruments.\nCapital risk management\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of net debt which includes the borrowings disclosed in notes 20 and 21 and shareholders' equity comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.\nThe capital structure of the Group is reviewed annually with reference to the costs applicable to each element of capital, future requirements of the Group, flexibility of capital drawdown and availability of further capital should it be required.\nThe Group has a target gearing ratio of approximately 50% but gearing may exceed these levels where a project is in the final stages, before start of construction and development refinancing or ultimate disposal. The Group structures borrowings into general facilities and secures specific financing for individual property projects as deemed appropriate.\nThe gearing ratio at the year-end was as follows:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nBorrowings and loans\n(27,609)\n(25,575)\nLease liabilities\n(234)\n(12)\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,034\n782\nNet debt\n(26,809)\n(24,805)\nEquity\n35,104\n54,091\nNet debt to equity ratio\n76.4%\n45.9%\nBank borrowing facilities and financial covenants\nThe Group had total borrowing net of cash and cash equivalents of \u00a326.809m at 31 March 2025 (2024: \u00a324.805m) with a gearing level of 76.4% (2024: 45.9%). The rise in gearing is principally due to the accounting write downs of property and assets of the Group. The Group has operated within its authorised facilities and has secured deferrals of covenants during the year when necessary.\nIn August 2024 the Company entered into a new agreement with NatWest to initially provide a maximum committed facility of \u00a321.7m until December 2026. The agreement has been amended to facilitate more time to achieve property disposals to allow reduction of debt to \u00a311.6m by 31 March 2026.\nThe banking facilities include financial covenants, including (i) a measure of EBITDA to interest covenant from June 2026 a cashflow to interest coverage test (ii) a debt to fair value of property valuation covenant and (iii) a capital expenditure covenant. The Group's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of the facilities and covenants ii) and iii) over a period of at least twelve months. The interest coverage test is not expected to be achievable in the life of the current facility and discussions continue with the company's banker on this matter.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Group uses financial instruments, comprising bank borrowing and various items including trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations. The main risk arising from the Group financial instruments is liquidity risk. The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. The Group has the ability to manage its liquidity through the timing of development projects and also the timing of the sale of assets.\nContractual maturity\nThe following tables analyse the Group's financial liabilities and net settled derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including principal.\nAs at 31 March 2025:\nTotal\n0 -1year\n1 to 2years\n2 to 5years\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nBank loans*\n(20,255)\n(8,690)\n(11,565)\n-\nOther loans*\n(7,354)\n(7,354)\n-\n-\nTrade and other payables*\n(1,633)\n(1,633)\n-\n-\nLease liabilities*\n(234)\n(41)\n(45)\n(148)\n(29,476)\n(17,718)\n(11,610)\n(148)\nAs at 31 March 2024:\nTotal\n0 to 1years\n1 to 2years\n2 to 5years\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nBank loans*\n(21,700)\n(21,700)\n-\n-\nOther loans*\n(3,875)\n(3,875)\n-\n-\nTrade and other payables*\n(2,194)\n(2,194)\n-\n-\nLease liabilities*\n(12)\n(12)\n-\n-\n(27,781)\n(27,781)\n-\n-\n* financial liabilities at amortised cost\nInterest rate risk\nThere is currently no SONIA swap in place to fix interest on any of the Group's bank debt. The Board has considered the merits of an instrument to fix interest rates at regular intervals during the year but has not entered into any hedging agreement due to the high cost of doing so at each review.\nCredit risk\nMany of the Group's customers are required to pay for services in advance of supply which reduces the Group's exposure to credit risk. Property rentals and marina berthing are examples of this. The Group pursues debtors vigorously where credit terms have been exceeded. The credit quality of the Group's financial assets can be summarised as follows:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nTrade receivables:\nNew customers (less than 12 months)\n24\n83\nExisting customers (more than 12 months) with no defaults in the past\n430\n482\nExisting customers (more than 12 months) with some defaults in the past\n37\n80\nTotal trade receivables net of provision for impairment\n491\n645\nCommodity price risk\nThe Group experiences volatile fuel prices throughout the year. The Group only acts as a reseller of fuel at the fish market and marinas. The sales prices are derived from the price paid for fuel and therefore fuel price exposure is no longer considered a risk.\nSensitivity analysis\nInterest rates\nIn managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group's earnings. Over the longer-term, however, higher interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.\nAs at 31 March 2025, it is estimated that a general increase of a percentage point in interest rates (being the best estimate of adverse future anticipated changes in interest rates), would have decreased the Group's profit before tax from continuing operations by approximately\n\u00a3203,000\n(\n2024: \u00a3217,000). Net assets would have decreased by the same amount.\nValuation of investment property and property held for use in the business\nLand & buildings valuations are complex, require a degree of judgement and are based on data some of which is publicly available and some that is not. We have classified the valuations of our property portfolio as level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. Level 3 means that the valuation model cannot rely on inputs that are directly available from an active market. All other factors remaining constant, an increase in trading income would increase valuation, whilst an increase in equivalent nominal yield would result in a fall in value and vice versa.\nIn establishing fair value the most significant unobservable input is considered to be the appropriate yield to apply to the trading income using a discounted cashflow. This is based on a number of factors including the maturity of the business and trading and economic outlook.\nYields applied across the investment assets are in the range of 4.85% - 12.65% with the average yield being 8.86%. Assuming all else stayed the same; a decrease of 1.0% in the average yield would result in an increase in fair value of \u00a32.459m. An increase of 1.0% in the average yield would result in a corresponding decrease in fair value of \u00a31.331m.\nTrading assets are valued using a discounted cashflow model which uses budgeted cashflows and appropriate discounts rates to reach a valuation. Market evidence is then considered in determine if the valuation is appropriate. Discount rates are judgemental and a change in the discount rate could results to different valuations being reported. An increase of 1% in the discount rate would result in a decrease in fair value of \u00a32.325m. A decrease of 1% in the discount rate would results in an increase of the fair value of \u00a32.200m.\nThese assets were independently valued by Jones Lang LaSalle (\"JLL\") at 31 March 2025. The valuation by JLL was in accordance with the Practice Statements in the Valuations Standards (The Red Book) published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, on a market-based evidence approach, which is consistent with the required IFRS 13 methodology.\n4. Accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with UK adopted IAS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are\nrecognised\nin the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nEstimates\nThe following are the areas that require the use of estimates that may impact the Group's balance sheet and income statement:\nThe valuation of investment property and property held for use in the business as at 31 March 2025 was \u00a315,230,000 and \u00a331,589,000 respectively; (2024: \u00a317,543,000 and \u00a336,889,000 respectively). In determining the fair value of properties, the Board relies on external valuations carried out by professionally qualified independent valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The valuation of investment properties uses estimated rental yields at industry wide rates, varied by sector, for each property based on market evidence at the date the valuation is carried out. Judgement is exercised in determining future rental income or profitability of the relevant properties. In the case of North Quay House, an office building where most tenants have vacated, the valuation is based on the price a purchaser might pay for the re-development opportunity. Properties held for use in the business (fishmarket, marinas and car parks) are valued using a discounted cash flow model with recent actuals and budgeted future results (fair maintainable operating profits) generated by the business activities operated from each owner-occupied property (some costs are reallocated between businesses for the discounted cashflow, but this has no impact on the overall valuations). Judgement is exercised in the preparation of the budgets and also in the discount factor multipliers applied to the fair maintainable operating profit to derive a valuation. Market evidence of values of similar assets is taken into account in the valuation process. Within the valuation of property held for use in the business, judgement is required to allocate the valuation between land and buildings. Any impact upon the valuation is therefore unknown at present. Further detail about the property valuation can be found in the Financial Review on page 11.\nJudgements\nThe following are the areas that require the use of judgements that may impact the Group's balance sheet and income statement:\nThe Board exercises judgement in determining whether properties should be classified as investment property or development inventory and this is done by reference to criteria including whether the property is being marketed for sale in the ordinary course of business and the nature of the development activity ongoing (including planning applications and development of proposals for submission to the relevant authorities).\nDetermining the net realisable value of development property 2025: \u00a318,461,000 see note 18; (2024: \u00a330,813,000)\nThe Board has exercised judgement in determining the net realisable value of development property, taking into account expected costs to complete and future sale proceeds, and hence whether any write-down of development property is required. Incorporated in the appraisal of net realisable value are judgements about: disposal revenue and/or investment value at completion; project formulation (including mix of development uses and development density); full development cost; amounts payable to third parties (for example, contributions to the local authority under section 106 agreements, sharing of proceeds with local authority and repayment of grants in the case of development of the former airport site); financing costs; time value of money; and, allowance for contingency.\nThe board has exercised judgement that the Former Airport Site is held as development inventory and that the net realisable value at 31 March 2025 is \u00a313.741m (2024: \u00a313.518m). The former airport site, a 113 acre site of which the Group directly owns c.8 acres and holds c.105 acres through an unexpired\n129 year leasehold interest, with a right to renew for a further 150 years, totalling 279\nyears, is held as development inventory at a carrying value of \u00a313.741m. At each balance sheet date, this carrying value is tested for impairment with the board needing to satisfy itself that the asset is included in inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with net realisable value including developer's return where applicable. The carrying value of \u00a313.741m is derived as follows:\n\u00b7\nThe land and building asset was independently valued twice yearly until 31 March 2013, when the asset was transferred to development inventory. The airport closed in December 2011.\n\u00b7\nAs at 31 March 2013 the land and building asset was transferred to development inventory and combined with the pre-existing inventory total, which included the cost of building the Link Road and planning intellectual property costs.\n\u00b7\nIt was agreed at 31 March 2013 that the transfer would be made at valuation, inclusive of historic revaluations. As at 31 March 2013 the carrying value of the former airport asset was \u00a311.479m, inclusive of past revaluations totalling \u00a33.969m. The net increase in former airport asset valuation from 31 March 2013 (\u00a311.479m) to 31 March 2024 (\u00a313.518m) of \u00a32.120m represents the capitalised costs of developing the planning intellectual property less the cost attributed to sales of small plots. \u00a313.741m represents the historic cost of the airport asset as at 31 March 2025.\n\u00b7\nIn addition to the net cash expenditure on the airport asset, the former aviation operations, ongoing site maintenance and security, together with interest costs thereon (Present Value of total cash expended) is more than double the \u00a313.741m.\nIn December 2016 the Department for Transport published the 'Plymouth Airport Study Report', which concluded that a lack of demand and a short runway mean commercially viable passenger services could not be run out of the former Plymouth Airport site as it would remain \"financially vulnerable\" in a \"high risk environment\".\nPlymouth City Council prepared its new local plan to for submission to the Government Planning Inspectorate in which they called for the retention of the airport site for a possible reopening.\nIn April 2017, the Group submitted its representations and detailed evidence base in support of allocation of the former Airport Site for alternative use in advance of the Government Inspectors' public hearing of proposed new local planning framework.\nThe public hearing took place in early 2018, with the Government Inspectors' report subsequently issued in March 2019. The Government Inspectors supported a 'safeguard' of the former airport site for a maximum of five years. The Inspectors advised that a safeguarding period longer than five years would not be appropriate given the strategic value of this brown-field site and based on their determination that five years should be more than enough time to realize a viable business plan for aviation activity, if such activity was viable.\nThe Group has continued to prepare its masterplan for alternative use of the site, reflecting the guidance of the Government Planning Inspectors that presided over the 2019 new Local Plan, for submission to the Local Authority in good time to allow full participation in the forthcoming 5-year review of the Local Plan.\nIn 2024, PCC advised that the five year review of the Local Plan had been made and that the former airport site would continue to be safeguarded for aviation uses for a further five years. The Group submitted the pre-application for a masterplan in March 2024 with proposed phased development that respects the Local Authority's policy. A committee formed of representatives of both the Group and Plymouth City Council has been engaged in discussions on the plan. In February 2024, the Group received a notice from Plymouth City Council claiming that the Group was in breach of its lease. After taking senior legal advice the Group has responded to strongly refute this claim. A further letter was received in August 2024 to which the Company provided clarification in a letter sent in September 2024 on some points raised and reiterated its view that the notice had been served wrongfully and again refuting the claim. The Group remains in discussion with the Council over the matter. Ongoing legal costs have been recorded as exceptional costs - refer to note 10. At present there is no indication of the likelihood, nor the resultant cost in connection with this claim.\nThe Group does not regard the carrying value of the former airport site to be reflective of its value for alternative use, which is in turn significantly less than the value that can be earnt from redevelopment of this strategic asset. The Group regards the value that can be earned from this strategic asset is significantly greater than both the carrying value and the Present Value of total cash expended.\nThe second largest development inventory item relates to the Sugar Quay (East Quay / former Boatyard) site at Sutton Harbour. Refer to the Chairman's Statement for further information. The board has decided to impair the carrying value of the site based on an appraisal of a lower density scheme which will better suit current market conditions and expected sales absorption rate. The planning consent secured for a much more densely built scheme expired in June 2025.\nUncertainties in relation to going concern\nAs explained in the going concern section, the Group has agreed a planned debt reduction programme with its bankers with set repayment dates up to 31 March 2026. This debt reduction programme is dependent on the realisation of certain assets within that period. In determining whether the uncertainties over the Group's ability to meet the conditions of the bank facility are considered material uncertainties, the board has exercised significant judgement to consider the relationship with the bank and alternative mitigating actions to be operable and effective:\n\u00b7\nA constructive relationship with the Group's bankers towards achieving the debt reduction plan and the bank's indicated flexibility over debt repayment dates subject to evidence of progress with asset sales and formal agreement from Credit.\n\u00b7\nThe possibility to dispose of alternative or additional assets, with flexibility in response to market conditions, to repay debt and/or raise additional capital\n\u00b7\nThe availability of alternative funding to refinance part/all of the bank facility finance\n\u00b7\nThe confirmed support from the major shareholder for ongoing company trading operations by way of additional Related Party Loans if necessary\n5. Segment results\nManagement has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors that are used to make strategic decisions. Details of the types of revenue generated by each segment are given in note 2.\nThe Board of Directors assesses performance using segmental operating profit.

Share based payment\nAn Inland Revenue approved Company Share Option plan (CSOP) has been established by Sutton Harbour Group plc whereby the Group may at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee grant options over ordinary shares in the Group to key management personnel. The options are issued for nil consideration and are granted in accordance with the Scheme's rules at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Option holders may exercise options after a minimum 3 year and maximum 10 year holding period, subject to the provisions and exceptions of the scheme rules. There are no other performance conditions governing the holder's right to exercise the options after the minimum holding period. Share options may only be exercised for shares. The fair value of the options was calculated using the Black Scholes model and the credit to the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2025 was \u00a317,394 (2024: credit \u00a3849). The cumulative charge to the Income Statement of the CSOP scheme is \u00a328,580 as at 31 March 2025.\nA weight averaged volatility input to the Black Scholes of 64% was applied being the average % fluctuations (positive and negative) of the share price compared to the grant price of share options issued.\nSet out below is a summary of options granted under the CSOP plan:\nGrant Date\nExpiry Date\nExercise Price\nBalance at start of year\nGranted\nExercised\nExpired\nBalance at end of year\nLife of options remaining\n27 Nov 2019\n26 Nov 2029\n22p\n0\n102,273\n0\n0\n102,273\n1,701 days\n8 July 2020\n8 July 2030\n19p\n102,273\n115,790\n0\n0\n218,063\n1,925 days\n23 Jun 2021\n23 Jun 2031\n25p\n218,063\n24,000\n0\n0\n242,063\n2,275 days\n20 Jun 2022\n20 Jun 2032\n22p\n242,063\n30,000\n0\n0\n2,638 days\n-\n23 Jun 2022\n22p\n-\n-\n0\n34,091\n237,972\n-\n6 June 2023\n6 June 2033\n20p\n237,972\n20,000\n0\n0\n257,972\n2,989 days\n31 Mar 2025\n257,972\nThe weighted average exercise price at 31 March 2025 was 20.78 pence (31 March 2024: 20.78 pence).\n13.

The cost transferred was made from development property inventory.\nRevaluations\nLand and buildings are measured using the revaluation model as set out in note 2. These assets were independently valued by Jones Lang LaSalle (\"JLL\") at 31 March 2025 (see Strategic Report page 4). The valuation by JLL was in accordance with the Practice Statements in the Valuations Standards (The Red Book) published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, on a market-based evidence approach. Further detail about property revaluation is included in the Financial Review on page 11.\nAt 31 March 2025, had the freehold land and buildings been measured using the cost model (historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses), their carrying value would be \u00a323,745,000 (2024: \u00a323,492,000).\nAt 31 March 2025, had the leasehold land and buildings been measured using the cost model (historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses), their carrying value would be \u00a31,110,000 (2024: \u00a31,110,000).\nAssets in the course of construction, plant, machinery and equipment and fixtures and fittings are all measured using the cost model, as set out in note 2.\nThe Group's obligations under leases are secured by the lessor's title to the fixed assets. The carrying value of floating vessel which is subject to lease is \u00a3327,000 (2024: \u00a344,000).\n15.

The fair value of the Group's investment property at 31 March 2025 has been determined by a valuation carried out on that date by independent, external valuers (see Strategic Report page 4), JLL in accordance with the Practice Statements in the Valuation Standards (The Red Book) published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. JLL is a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and have appropriate qualifications and recent experience in the valuation of properties in the relevant locations. The valuations, which are supported by market evidence, are prepared by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable from the properties and, where relevant, associated costs. A yield which reflects the specific risks inherent in the net cash flows is then applied to the net annual rentals to arrive at the property valuation.

With historic and expected future losses being low, the Directors consider it appropriate to apply a single average rate for expected credit losses to the overall population of trade receivables.\n20.
