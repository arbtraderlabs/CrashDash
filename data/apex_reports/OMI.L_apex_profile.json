The latter of these was acquired by Orosur in November 2024 from the Company's previous JV partners, Newmont Mining and Agnico Eagle Mines. Orosur thus owns 100% of the Anz\u00e1 Project.\nSince acquiring 100% control, the Company has focussed its attention on three prospects:\n\u00b7\nPepas - a shallow, high-grade body of gold mineralisation that the Company is endeavouring to move to an initial Mineral Resource Estimate in the near term.\n\u00b7\nAPTA - a high-grade body of gold mineralisation that has to date seen 38,000m of drilling, but is not yet sufficiently understood geologically to allow a MRE to be calculated. The Company plans to undertake additional drilling at APTA in 2026, with the objective of advancing it toward an MRE.\n\u00b7\nEl Cedro - a large gold porphyry system in the south of the Project area. The Company has completed a large soil sampling program and plans to undertake a maiden drill program here in early 2026.\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas Drilling\nAs announced on 14th July 2025, the Company had taken the formal decision to commence infill drilling at its Pepas gold prospect at Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") as quickly as possible.\nThis infill drill program was completed late in December 2025, with results from the final three holes PEP072, PEP073 and PEP074 just received.\nAs expected, gold assay results from these three holes were exceptional, demonstrating the core of Pepas to contain very thick, high-grade zones of gold mineralisation.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP072B\n0\n47.6\n47.6\n3.43\nincluding\n16.25\n19.7\n3.45\n6.52\nPEP073\n0\n104.45\n104.45\n5.96\nincluding\n25.45\n59.6\n34.15\n10.3\nPEP074\n0\n71.35\n71.35\n6.46\nincluding\n11.4\n26.5\n15.1\n23.59\nTable 1. Latest drill Intercepts, Pepas Prospect\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nFigure 3. Section, PEP072\nFigure 3. Section, PEP073, PEP074\nWith the receipt of these results, the gold assay database has been closed off and handed to our resource consultants so that work on the MRE modelling process can commence.\nFeasibility\nThe Company has begun the process of assessing the economic exploitation options for Pepas in the context of the Colombian permitting regime. Discussions are currently underway with local technical consultants to map out the permitting framework, necessary environmental and social studies, and development of the required technical work plan (Programa de Trabajo y Obras - PTO), that could commence once an MRE is finalised.\nWider Exploration\nFollowing the Christmas break and retirement of the old drill rig for much needed repairs, a new rig has arrived on site to commence a regional drill program north of Pepas. This program is reconnaissance in nature, designed to better understand the wider litho-structural environment that controls the Pepas mineralisation.\nAs has been previously announced, plans for drilling programs to the south at APTA and El Cedro will be progressed once airborne geophysical surveys have been undertaken over these prospects. Options for this work are being assessed.\nGranting of mining exploration licences (\"Titles\")\nThe Company is constantly assessing its land package in Colombia in terms of geological potential, costs to hold, the ability of exploration work to be undertaken and any subsequent discovery exploited in light of local community sentiment.\nTo that end, several major adjustments were made at the end of December 2025.\nTwo of the larger, longer held applications, that made up the bulk of the original Anz\u00e1 JV project, have now been granted, and converted to exploration licences (Figure 1). The Company thus now has three large contiguous granted Titles, totalling 173km2, all within the mining friendly Anz\u00e1 municipality, an increase of some 65%.\nReconnaissance surface work has previously been undertaken on these new licences by the Company's previous JV partners. These data will now be re-assessed and exploration plans developed accordingly now that drilling is able to be undertaken.\nIn addition, several smaller applications have been dropped for various reasons, including geological prospectivity, or likely inability to able to be explored as they fall outside Anz\u00e1 municipality in less receptive areas.\nThe Company thus currently now has 154km2 under application.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The Company starts 2026 in a very different position to a year ago. One deposit (hopefully) soon to enter feasibility, two rigs turning in two countries and an increasing list of high-quality targets lining up to be next.

(TSXV: OMI; AIM: OMI) is a minerals explorer and developer currently operating in Colombia and Argentina.\nQualified Persons Statement\nThe information in this news release was compiled, reviewed, verified and approved by Mr. Brad George, BSc Hons (Geology and Geophysics), MBA, Member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (MAIG), CEO of Orosur Mining Inc. and a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\nOrosur Mining Inc. staff follow standard operating and quality assurance procedures to ensure that sampling techniques and sample results meet international reporting standards.\nDrill core is split in half over widths that vary between 0.3m and 2m, depending upon the geological domain. One half is kept on site in the Minera Anz\u00e1 core storage facility in the case of the Anza Project, or on site in temporary racks in the case of the El Pantano Project, with the other sent for assay.\nIndustry standard QAQC protocols are put in place with approximately 10% of total submitted samples being blanks, repeats or Certified Reference Materials (CRMs).\nSamples for holes PEP-001 to PEP-011 were sent to the Medellin preparation facility of ALS Colombia Ltd, and then to the ISO 9001 certified ALS Chemex laboratory in Lima, Peru.\nSamples from PEP-012 onwards are sent to Medellin laboratory of Actlabs for preparation and fire assay, with some sample then sent to the Canadian Actlabs facility for multi element assay\nSamples from the EL Pantano project are sent to the preparation facility and fire assay laboratory of Alex Stewart Laboratories in Perito Moreno to be assayed for gold. Pulps are then sent to the larger Alex Stewart facility in Mendoza for multi-element analysis.\n30 gram nominal weight samples are then subject to fire assay and AAS analysis for gold with gravimetric re-finish for overlimit assays of >5 g/t. ICP-MS Ultra-Trace level multi-element four-acid digest analyses may also undertaken for such elements as silver, copper, lead and zinc, etc.\nGold intersections are reported using a lower cut-off of 0.3g/t Au over 3m.\nIntersections are quoted as downhole thicknesses. True thicknesses are unknown.\nForward Looking Statements\nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained in this news release constitute \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including but not limited to the \"safe harbour\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on expectations estimates and projections as of the date of this news release.\nForward-looking statements include, without limitation, the continuing focus on the Pepas prospect, the exploration plans in Colombia and the funding of those plans, and other events or conditions that may occur in the future. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate. Actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in the Section \"Risks Factors\" of the Company's MD&A for the year ended May 31, 2025. The Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain adequate financing. This material uncertainty may cast significant doubt upon the Company's ability to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business and accordingly the appropriateness of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events and such forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
