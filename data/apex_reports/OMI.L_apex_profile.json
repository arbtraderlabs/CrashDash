Orosur owns 100% of these titles and applications through two Colombian wholly owned subsidiary companies, Minera Anz\u00e1, and Minera Monte Aguila.\nThe Pepas gold deposit is located in the northern part of the Anz\u00e1 project area and was discovered by the Company's previous JV partners in early 2022, but not advanced. When the Company reassumed 100% ownership of Anz\u00e1 in November 2024, it commenced drilling immediately at Pepas with positive results, leading to the decision in June 2025 to focus drilling entirely at Pepas to allow estimation of a Mineral Resource as quickly as possible.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The Company's decision to focus its efforts on moving the Pepas deposit toward an MRE has been justified with this result. We will now immediately move Pepas into the economic study and permitting stage, while at the same time expanding our exploration effort to begin testing e other prospects within the Anz\u00e1 project.\"\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas Mineral Resource Estimate\nA Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") has been completed for the Pepas deposit by international mineral consulting firm, Bara Consulting Limited, with an effective date of\n16 January 2026\n. The MRE was prepared in accordance with the 2019 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines and 2014 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves and disclosed to National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). Details of the MRE evaluation will be provided in a Technical Report prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 filed under the Company's SEDAR profile within 45 days of this release.\nThe Pepas Mineral Resource comprises an estimated 1.14 million tonnes at a grade of 5.46 g/t gold for 201,000 ounces of gold in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 0.19 million tonnes at a grade of 2.99 g/t gold for 19,000 ounces of gold in the Inferred Mineral Resource category and assumes extraction via an open pit mining scenario. Mineral Resources are classified as Indicated and Inferred based on CIM Definition Standards.\nThe resource is entirely contained within an open pit shell, down to a vertical depth of approximately 100m, with mineralisation starting at surface. The MRE and pit shell have been generated using a gold price of US$3000/oz and a reporting cut-off grade of 0.92g/t Au.\nDeposit\nResource Category\nTonnes (Mt)\nGold Grade (g/t)\nContained Gold (ozs)\nPepas\nIndicated\n1.14\n5.46\n201,000\nPepas\nInferred\n0.19\n2.99\n18,000\nTable 1.

Block model cross section, resource classification\nFigure 6. Isometric view\nMRE Parameters and Methodology\nThe Mineral Resource estimate is estimated from diamond drill hole data contained within a database at a cut-off date of 16 January 2026. The data set used for estimation includes a total of 79 diamond drill holes representing 10,592.10 metres of drilling. The current drill hole spacing ranges from approximately 15m to 30m over the deposit.\nMineral Resource domains were created within a NW-SE fault-bounded block whose dimensions are approximately 200m (strike length) x 100m (width) to a maximum depth of 100m in which gold is hosted within a broadly NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW trending sinuous zone of quartz veining. Bounding structures have been modelled and are broadly coincident with the broad extents of silic/sericitic alteration as defined from logging and fundamentally constrain the mineralised zones to a NW-orientated lozenge, mirrored by a nominal 0.15g/t Au threshold. Two spatial grade domains (LG and HG - the latter above 1.0g/t Au) are modelled using implicit modelling in Leapfrog\u2122 software, supported by statistical analysis of the dataset, orientated broadly N-S with subvertical dip. In addition, a small, near surface domain hosted in colluvium has also been modelled at a 0.5g/t gold cut-off.\nIn addition to mineralised domains, bounding faults and weathering surfaces are modelled, constrained to topography and a flagged block model created into which gold grade is estimated. Parent cell dimensions of 10m x 10m x 5m were sub-celled down to a minimum 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m to ensure accurate representation of mineralised domain geometries and volumes. Gold assay data within mineralised domain was composited to 2m to ensure equal support in grade estimation and appropriate grade capping was applied to mitigate the influence of extreme grade values during estimation. Statistical and geostatistical (variography) analysis was completed on 2m composites to assess directions and ranges of grade continuity and inform estimation parameters used. Density was assigned to the model via Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) using density values obtained from drill core samples across the deposit. Grade estimation into parent blocks was run via Ordinary Kriging (OK) in three passes of increasing search pass volume until all model blocks received an estimated grade. Block model validations (global and local) were performed including visual inspection of block grades against input composite grades, comparison of global mean values, volume checks and swath plots to ensure no significant bias in the estimate.\nThe Mineral Resource estimate meets the requirements of reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction (RPEEE) by reporting only material above a cut-off of 0.92g/t Au derived from a conceptual open pit optimisation using the following parameters; throughput of 250ktpa, gold price (USD$3,000), payability (99.5%), Au recovery derived as the average from recent test work results from drill core composite samples (88.75%), ROM transport cost (USD$2.50/t) processing costs (USD$60/t), G&A cost (USD$10/t) and mining costs (US$2.05/t, US$3.40/t and USD$3.50/t for oxide, transitional and fresh material respectively).\nThe Mineral Resource Estimate classification is informed by adequate close spaced exploration drilling, sufficient understanding of the geological and structural framework at Pepas, appropriate QA/QC controls providing acceptable confidence in the overall quality of sampling and accuracy/precision of assay data, confidence in the mineralisation domain interpretations and geostatistical analysis, sufficient to assume (in the case of Indicated Mineral Resources) or imply (in the case of Inferred Mineral Resources) geological and grade continuity. Indicated Mineral Resources have been classified where block grade estimates have been captured in the first search pass (up to 30m - the range of continuity as defined by the variogram).\nOrosur Mining Inc. staff follow standard operating and quality assurance procedures to ensure that sampling techniques and sample results meet international reporting standards. Drill core is split in half over widths that vary between 0.3m and 2m, depending upon the geological domain. One half is kept on site in the Minera Anz\u00e1 core storage facility in the case of the Anz\u00e1 Project with the other sent for assay.\nDrillhole samples from PEP001 to PEP011 (2022 programme) were submitted to ALS Medell\u00edn, Colombia for sample preparation, with pulps subsequently analysed at ALS Lima, Peru. Both laboratories hold ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accreditation for the preparation and analytical methods performed. In a limited number of instances, samples were forwarded within the ALS network to other ALS facilities for final analysis, including laboratories in Canada, Laos, and South Africa.\nDrillhole samples from PEP012 to PEP074 (2024/2025 programme) were submitted to Actlabs Colombia S.A.S. for both sample preparation and analysis. The laboratory is certified to ISO 9001\nSamples submitted to ALS were bar-coded and logged into the Laboratory Information Management System, weighed, dried, and finely crushed to over 70% passing a 2-millimetre screen. A sub-sample of up to 250g is taken using a riffle splitter and pulverized to over 85% passing 75 microns. The pulverised sample is then split for delivery to the analysis lab. Gold was analysed by fire assay at ALS using a 30 g charge with an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish (ALS method Au-AA23). Samples returning gold values above the upper limit of the Au-AA23 method were re-analysed by fire assay with gravimetric finish. Where coarse gold was suspected based on geology and/or assay behaviour, selected samples were re-analysed by Screen Fire Assay (SFA).\nSamples sent to Actlabs were logged into the Laboratory Information Management System manually, oven dried, and finely crushed to over 80% passing a 2-millimetre screen. A sub-sample of up to 250g is taken using a riffle splitter and pulverized to over 95% passing 105 microns. A 30g is then split for the analysis. Gold was analysed by fire assay with AAS. samples returning >10 g/t Au were routinely re-analysed by fire assay with gravimetric finish.\na QA/QC program is in place to ensure that sampling, laboratory submission, data handling, and verification practices meet accepted industry standards suitable for public reporting. Roles and responsibilities are defined across project management and geology personnel, with implementation verified through staff training and periodic (scheduled and unscheduled) audits covering field methods, sample custody, laboratory processes, and database integrity.\nQuality control monitoring is based on routine insertion of control samples to assess contamination, precision, and accuracy. Control samples include coarse blanks (BKG) to monitor preparation contamination, certified reference materials (CRM) to monitor analytical accuracy, and duplicates to monitor precision at multiple stages: field duplicates (DU), coarse/crush duplicates (DUG), and pulp duplicates (DUP) at insertion rates of 1 in 40 (12.5%).\nThe QP has reviewed the QA/QC procedures, analytical data and information provided in relation to lab audits, non-conformity reporting, sample security and completed analysis of available data which indicates that, overall, the analytical dataset is acceptable for use in a Mineral Resource Evaluation.\nPepas and Anz\u00e1 Project Geology\nThe Anz\u00e1 Project is located in the Middle Cauca belt of Colombia on the west side of the Romeral-Cauca fault system. The project predominantly overlies Upper Cretaceous to Palaeocene mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks and sediments of the Western Cordillera, deposited in oceanic plateau to intra-oceanic arc settings and intruded by co-magmatic stocks of gabbro to quartz-diorite composition. More localised Miocene porphyritic intrusions are of diorite to granodiorite composition.\nThe Pepas deposit is located in the northern portion of the Anz\u00e1 Project and is interpreted as an intermediate sulphidation epithermal gold system. Gold mineralization at Pepas is hosted within volcaniclastic and epiclastic rocks of the Upper Cretaceous Barroso Formation\nThe Pepas Mineral Resource occurs within a NW-trending fault zone termed the Pepas fault zone, an antithetic fault relative to the NE-trending Arag\u00f3n fault. The Mineral Resource is bounded by two strands of the fault, the southwest bounding fault dipping to the northeast and the northeast bounding fault dipping to the southwest. These faults and their splays also converge to the northwest and southeast and, as a result, the Mineral Resource has been estimated within an enclosed fault-bounded lens or lozenge.\nWithin the fault lozenge, the tuffaceous and epiclastic host rocks show strong to intense silicification\n, quartz-sericite alteration,\nand steeply-dipping quartz veining at 1-10 cm scale. Veining has a dominant north- to NNE-trend which is parallel to the regional grain but oblique to the bounding faults.\nOverprinting argillic alteration in the fault and shear zones is variably pyritic but only weakly anomalous in gold.\nVeining is banded and sinuous banded with thin sulphidic laminae and selvedges, suggestive of epithermal style with multi-stage\nrepeated pulses of mineralizing\nfluid\nover an extended period of time\n. The sulphide content is low, with pre\ndominant pyrite and sphalerite and subordinate galena and chalcopyrite.\nGold grade is closely related to intensity of veining and abundance of sulphide, predominantly low-iron sphalerite and pyrite, with subordinate galena and chalcopyrite.\nFigure 7.

Orosur Mining Inc. (\"Orosur\" or \"the Company\") (TSX-V/AIM: OMI) the minerals developer and explorer with operations in Colombia and Argentina,\nannounces its unaudited results for the quarter ended November 30th, 2025. All dollar figures are stated in US$ unless otherwise noted.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended November 30th, 2025 and the related management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\") have been filed and are available for review on\nthe SEDAR+ website at www.sedarplus.ca.

As anticipated, drilling\nresults have firmed up the Pepas deposit and provided better definition of the nature of the thick, high-grade mineralisation. Recent results are largely as expected in terms of the grade distribution across Pepas.\nThe MRE at Pepas is anticipated to be delivered by the end of January 2026.\nAt El Cedro, some 10kms to the south of Pepas but on the same licence, the Company completed a large-scale soil geochemical survey covering most of what is thought to be a large scale porphyry system. Soil samples were taken at roughly 25m intervals, along ridges and spurs for ease of access and to ensure soils were residual. The survey showed gold assay results identifying a substantial, gold bearing system, with highly anomalous geochemical responses over a large, well preserved zoned porphyry system, with soil samples assays at times exceeding 1g/t Au.\nIn addition, analysis of\nnew geochemical data, in conjunction with historical mapping information and airborne geophysical data collected in 2012 has identified a second porphyry system to the south of El Cedro within the same structural regional corridor.\n\u00b7\nIn Argentina\n,\nthe Company has earned a direct 51% interest in the Argentine company, Deseado Dorado S.A.S (\"Deseado\"), that owns the exploration licences that make up the El Pantano Project in Santa Cruz province. The Company has now moved into the Phase 2 of the JV, that will see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional\u00a0US$2m, a large part of which will be spent on a 3,000 metre drill program which commenced at El Pantano in November and is expected to conclude in early 2026.\nFirst holes from\u00a0the El Pantano\u00a0drilling program confirm a low sulphidation epithermal mineral system. Whilst assays are still awaited, the Company is confident that it has achieved its general objective of proving the existence of a substantial mineral system.\n\u00b7\nIn Nigeria\n,\u00a0in view of the Company's need to prioritise the use of its capital and human resources, a decision was taken to withdraw from the lithium project which will be formalized over the next few weeks. The investment in Nigeria was fully impaired in the Company's financial statements as at May 31, 2025 and it remains fully impaired.\nFinancial and Corporate\n\u00b7\nOn November 30, 2025, the Company had a cash balance of US$16,280,000 (May 31, 2025 US$4,877,000). As at the date of this MD&A and including the funds raised in the private placement (detailed below), the Company had a cash balance of US$14,920,000.\n\u00b7\nO\nn September 18, 2025 the Company announced an upsized brokered private placement (the \"Placing\") to raise gross proceeds of up to CAD$20 million through the issue of up to 58,823,530 common shares at a price of CAD$0.34 per common share. The Placing, which was over- subscribed, was completed on October 2 2025 and raised CAD$20 million. No warrants were issued in connection with the Placing.\n\u00b7\nPost the period end, at the Company's AGM held on December 17, 2025\nall resolutions put to shareholders were duly passed.\n\u00b7\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost method except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are accounted for as Assets and Liabilities held for sale (at the lower of book value or fair value) and Profit and Loss from discontinuing operations.

The latter of these was acquired by Orosur in November 2024 from the Company's previous JV partners, Newmont Mining and Agnico Eagle Mines. Orosur thus owns 100% of the Anz\u00e1 Project.\nSince acquiring 100% control, the Company has focussed its attention on three prospects:\n\u00b7\nPepas - a shallow, high-grade body of gold mineralisation that the Company is endeavouring to move to an initial Mineral Resource Estimate in the near term.\n\u00b7\nAPTA - a high-grade body of gold mineralisation that has to date seen 38,000m of drilling, but is not yet sufficiently understood geologically to allow a MRE to be calculated. The Company plans to undertake additional drilling at APTA in 2026, with the objective of advancing it toward an MRE.\n\u00b7\nEl Cedro - a large gold porphyry system in the south of the Project area. The Company has completed a large soil sampling program and plans to undertake a maiden drill program here in early 2026.\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas Drilling\nAs announced on 14th July 2025, the Company had taken the formal decision to commence infill drilling at its Pepas gold prospect at Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") as quickly as possible.\nThis infill drill program was completed late in December 2025, with results from the final three holes PEP072, PEP073 and PEP074 just received.\nAs expected, gold assay results from these three holes were exceptional, demonstrating the core of Pepas to contain very thick, high-grade zones of gold mineralisation.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP072B\n0\n47.6\n47.6\n3.43\nincluding\n16.25\n19.7\n3.45\n6.52\nPEP073\n0\n104.45\n104.45\n5.96\nincluding\n25.45\n59.6\n34.15\n10.3\nPEP074\n0\n71.35\n71.35\n6.46\nincluding\n11.4\n26.5\n15.1\n23.59\nTable 1. Latest drill Intercepts, Pepas Prospect\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nFigure 3. Section, PEP072\nFigure 3. Section, PEP073, PEP074\nWith the receipt of these results, the gold assay database has been closed off and handed to our resource consultants so that work on the MRE modelling process can commence.\nFeasibility\nThe Company has begun the process of assessing the economic exploitation options for Pepas in the context of the Colombian permitting regime. Discussions are currently underway with local technical consultants to map out the permitting framework, necessary environmental and social studies, and development of the required technical work plan (Programa de Trabajo y Obras - PTO), that could commence once an MRE is finalised.\nWider Exploration\nFollowing the Christmas break and retirement of the old drill rig for much needed repairs, a new rig has arrived on site to commence a regional drill program north of Pepas. This program is reconnaissance in nature, designed to better understand the wider litho-structural environment that controls the Pepas mineralisation.\nAs has been previously announced, plans for drilling programs to the south at APTA and El Cedro will be progressed once airborne geophysical surveys have been undertaken over these prospects. Options for this work are being assessed.\nGranting of mining exploration licences (\"Titles\")\nThe Company is constantly assessing its land package in Colombia in terms of geological potential, costs to hold, the ability of exploration work to be undertaken and any subsequent discovery exploited in light of local community sentiment.\nTo that end, several major adjustments were made at the end of December 2025.\nTwo of the larger, longer held applications, that made up the bulk of the original Anz\u00e1 JV project, have now been granted, and converted to exploration licences (Figure 1). The Company thus now has three large contiguous granted Titles, totalling 173km2, all within the mining friendly Anz\u00e1 municipality, an increase of some 65%.\nReconnaissance surface work has previously been undertaken on these new licences by the Company's previous JV partners. These data will now be re-assessed and exploration plans developed accordingly now that drilling is able to be undertaken.\nIn addition, several smaller applications have been dropped for various reasons, including geological prospectivity, or likely inability to able to be explored as they fall outside Anz\u00e1 municipality in less receptive areas.\nThe Company thus currently now has 154km2 under application.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The Company starts 2026 in a very different position to a year ago. One deposit (hopefully) soon to enter feasibility, two rigs turning in two countries and an increasing list of high-quality targets lining up to be next.

(TSXV: OMI; AIM: OMI) is a minerals explorer and developer currently operating in Colombia and Argentina.\nQualified Persons Statement\nThe information in this news release was compiled, reviewed, verified and approved by Mr. Brad George, BSc Hons (Geology and Geophysics), MBA, Member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (MAIG), CEO of Orosur Mining Inc. and a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\nOrosur Mining Inc. staff follow standard operating and quality assurance procedures to ensure that sampling techniques and sample results meet international reporting standards.\nDrill core is split in half over widths that vary between 0.3m and 2m, depending upon the geological domain. One half is kept on site in the Minera Anz\u00e1 core storage facility in the case of the Anza Project, or on site in temporary racks in the case of the El Pantano Project, with the other sent for assay.\nIndustry standard QAQC protocols are put in place with approximately 10% of total submitted samples being blanks, repeats or Certified Reference Materials (CRMs).\nSamples for holes PEP-001 to PEP-011 were sent to the Medellin preparation facility of ALS Colombia Ltd, and then to the ISO 9001 certified ALS Chemex laboratory in Lima, Peru.\nSamples from PEP-012 onwards are sent to Medellin laboratory of Actlabs for preparation and fire assay, with some sample then sent to the Canadian Actlabs facility for multi element assay\nSamples from the EL Pantano project are sent to the preparation facility and fire assay laboratory of Alex Stewart Laboratories in Perito Moreno to be assayed for gold. Pulps are then sent to the larger Alex Stewart facility in Mendoza for multi-element analysis.\n30 gram nominal weight samples are then subject to fire assay and AAS analysis for gold with gravimetric re-finish for overlimit assays of >5 g/t. ICP-MS Ultra-Trace level multi-element four-acid digest analyses may also undertaken for such elements as silver, copper, lead and zinc, etc.\nGold intersections are reported using a lower cut-off of 0.3g/t Au over 3m.\nIntersections are quoted as downhole thicknesses. True thicknesses are unknown.\nForward Looking Statements\nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained in this news release constitute \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including but not limited to the \"safe harbour\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on expectations estimates and projections as of the date of this news release.\nForward-looking statements include, without limitation, the continuing focus on the Pepas prospect, the exploration plans in Colombia and the funding of those plans, and other events or conditions that may occur in the future. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate. Actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those described in the Section \"Risks Factors\" of the Company's MD&A for the year ended May 31, 2025. The Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain adequate financing. This material uncertainty may cast significant doubt upon the Company's ability to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business and accordingly the appropriateness of the use of accounting principles applicable to a going concern.

The latter of these was acquired by Orosur in November 2024 from the Company's previous JV partners, Newmont Mining and Agnico Eagle Mines. Orosur thus owns 100% of the Anz\u00e1 Project.\nSince acquiring 100% control, the Company has focussed its attention on three prospects:\n\u00b7\nPepas - a shallow, high-grade body of gold mineralisation that the Company is endeavouring to move to an initial Mineral Resource Estimate in the near term.\n\u00b7\nAPTA - a high-grade body of gold mineralisation that has to date seen 38,000m of drilling, but is not yet sufficiently understood geologically to allow a MRE to be calculated. The Company plans to undertake additional drilling at APTA in 2026, with the objective of advancing it toward an MRE.\n\u00b7\nEl Cedro - a large gold porphyry system in the south of the Project area. The Company has completed a large soil sampling program and plans to undertake a maiden drill program here in early 2026.\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas Drilling\nAs announced on 14th July 2025, the Company had taken the formal decision to commence infill drilling at its Pepas gold prospect at Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") as quickly as possible.\nThis infill drill program was completed late in December 2025, with results from the final three holes PEP072, PEP073 and PEP074 just received.\nAs expected, gold assay results from these three holes were exceptional, demonstrating the core of Pepas to contain very thick, high-grade zones of gold mineralisation.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP072B\n0\n47.6\n47.6\n3.43\nincluding\n16.25\n19.7\n3.45\n6.52\nPEP073\n0\n104.45\n104.45\n5.96\nincluding\n25.45\n59.6\n34.15\n10.3\nPEP074\n0\n71.35\n71.35\n6.46\nincluding\n11.4\n26.5\n15.1\n23.59\nTable 1. Latest drill Intercepts, Pepas Prospect\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nFigure 3. Section, PEP072\nFigure 3. Section, PEP073, PEP074\nWith the receipt of these results, the gold assay database has been closed off and handed to our resource consultants so that work on the MRE modelling process can commence.\nFeasibility\nThe Company has begun the process of assessing the economic exploitation options for Pepas in the context of the Colombian permitting regime. Discussions are currently underway with local technical consultants to map out the permitting framework, necessary environmental and social studies, and development of the required technical work plan (Programa de Trabajo y Obras - PTO), that could commence once an MRE is finalised.\nWider Exploration\nFollowing the Christmas break and retirement of the old drill rig for much needed repairs, a new rig has arrived on site to commence a regional drill program north of Pepas. This program is reconnaissance in nature, designed to better understand the wider litho-structural environment that controls the Pepas mineralisation.\nAs has been previously announced, plans for drilling programs to the south at APTA and El Cedro will be progressed once airborne geophysical surveys have been undertaken over these prospects. Options for this work are being assessed.\nGranting of mining exploration licences (\"Titles\")\nThe Company is constantly assessing its land package in Colombia in terms of geological potential, costs to hold, the ability of exploration work to be undertaken and any subsequent discovery exploited in light of local community sentiment.\nTo that end, several major adjustments were made at the end of December 2025.\nTwo of the larger, longer held applications, that made up the bulk of the original Anz\u00e1 JV project, have now been granted, and converted to exploration licences (Figure 1). The Company thus now has three large contiguous granted Titles, totalling 173km2, all within the m",

The latter of these was acquired by Orosur in November 2024 from the Company's previous JV partners, Newmont Mining and Agnico Eagle Mines. Orosur thus owns 100% of the Anz\u00e1 Project.\nSince acquiring 100% control, the Company has focussed its attention on three prospects:\n\u00b7\nPepas - a shallow, high-grade body of gold mineralisation that the Company is endeavouring to move to an initial Mineral Resource Estimate ('MRE') in the near term.\n\u00b7\nAPTA - a high-grade body of gold mineralisation that has to date seen 38,000m of drilling, but is not yet sufficiently understood geologically to allow a MRE to be calculated. The Company plans to undertake additional drilling at APTA in 2026, with the objective of advancing it toward an MRE.\n\u00b7\nEl Cedro - a large gold porphyry system in the south of the Project area. The Company has completed a large soil sampling program and plans to undertake a maiden drill program here in early 2026.\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nAs announced on 14th July 2025, the Company had taken the formal decision to commence infill drilling at its Pepas gold prospect at Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate as quickly as possible.\nThe Company's external geological and resource consultants visited the Anza site at the start of November to carry out the necessary QAQC verification of drilling and sampling and to work with the Orosur geological team in the development of a new NI43-101 technical report for the Anza project, which will include a MRE for the Pepas Prospect.\nOne outcome of this visit was the recommendation by the consultants for an extension of the final stages of the MRE drill-out program, with several additional holes within and outside the Pepas deposit to define the boundaries of the current deposit envelope and obtain a better understanding of the size and controls of previously defined high-grade zones.\nHoles drilled outside the deposit envelope have returned the lower grade halo mineralisation as expected and have provided valuable information as to the nature of the some of the controlling structures of Pepas. The one hole of this current batch drilled inside the deposit envelope (PEP-067) returned a result of 83.7m @ 4.29g/t Au from surface.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP067\n0\n83.7\n83.7\n4.29\nincluding\n21.6\n39.05\n17.45\n7.12\nIncluding\n61.7\n72.5\n10.8\n8.06\nPEP068\n0\n8\n8\n0.67\n17.4\n22\n4.6\n0.37\n47.55\n51\n3.45\n0.34\nPEP069\n0\n2.25\n2.25\n0.96\nPEP070\n0\n2\n2\n1.34\n37.7\n40.45\n2.75\n1.11\n84.1\n149.4\n65.3\n0.68\nPEP071\n0\n3.2\n3.2\n0.42\n71.35\n78\n6.65\n0.45\nTable 1. Latest drill Intercepts, Pepas Prospect\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nFigure 3. Section, PEP067\nIt is expected that the Pepas drill-out program will continue for the next few days and the resulting MRE and technical report can then be completed during January 2026.\nMetallurgy\nAs part of the MRE process, a large diameter PQ drill hole was completed specifically to provide sufficient material for a comprehensive metallurgical testing program. These samples have been sent to the metallurgical testing facility of ALS Global in British Columbia, where the work is now well advanced. It is hoped this program may be completed by the end of the year and thus feed into the Technical Report and MRE.\nWider Exploration - Anza\nThe Company had previously announced that it had planned to undertake a detailed airborne magnetic survey over the EL Cedro and APTA prospects in December, as a tool to provide additional guidance for drilling in early 2026. The Company is engaging with contractors to commission the survey.\nMapping, sampling and trenching is also underway in the environs of the Pepas deposit, as part of an ongoing program to explore for extensions and/or repetitions of Pepas. Once the current resource drilling program is completed in coming weeks, it is likely the rig will be shifted to targets being devel",

The latter of these companies was acquired by Orosur in November 2024 from the Company's previous JV partners, Newmont Mining and Agnico Eagle Mines. Orosur thus owns 100% of the Anz\u00e1 Project.\nSince acquiring 100% control, the Company has focussed its attention on three prospects:\n\u00b7\nPepas\n- a shallow, high-grade body of gold mineralisation that the Company is endeavouring to move to an initial Mineral Resource Estimate in the near term.\n\u00b7\nAPTA\n- a high-grade body of gold mineralisation that has to date seen 38,000m of drilling, but is not yet sufficiently understood geologically to allow a MRE to be calculated. The Company plans to undertake additional drilling at APTA in late 2025 with the objective of advancing it toward an MRE as quickly as possible.\n\u00b7\nEl Cedro\n- a large gold porphyry system in the south of the Anza Project area. The Company has just completed a large sampling program and plans to undertake a maiden drill program here in early 2026.\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas\nAs announced on 14th July 2025, the Company took the formal decision to commence infill drilling at its Pepas gold prospect at Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) by the end of the year.\nDrilling progress has recently slowed largely due to issues related to broken ground in hole PEP065 and the need to reconfigure the drill rig for PQ metallurgical drilling followed by the subsequent expected slower pace of advance for this larger diameter core.\nHole PEP-066 was a hole drilled to provide material for detailed metallurgical testing - the hole was drilled using a wider diameter PQ bit to provide additional material for testing and was drilled through the centre of the ore body so as to provide material representative of all mineral domains thus far identified. In order for all domains to be intersected, it was necessary to drill into known ore zones, and thus PEP-066 was drilled very close to several previous holes that had returned high grade intersections.\nThese three holes have all returned exceptional high grade gold assay results.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP065\n10.7\n13.6\n2.9\n2.79\n30.5\n63.9\n33.4\n2.84\nIncluding\n40.45\n53.5\n13.05\n5.87\nPEP065B*\n15.15\n17.1\n1.95\n3.04\n25.9\n59.7\n33.8\n2.84\nincluding\n27.9\n39.35\n11.45\n5.45\nPEP066\n0\n112\n112\n5.25\nincluding\n17.2\n46.5\n29.3\n8.92\nincluding\n35.9\n46.5\n10.6\n12.25\nincluding\n43.25\n46.5\n3.25\n22.95\nincluding\n92.4\n111.3\n18.9\n8.04\nTable 1.

Orosur Mining Inc. (\"Orosur\" or \"the Company\") (TSX-V: OMI) (AIM: OMI) announces its audited results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2025. All dollar figures are stated in thousands of US$ unless otherwise noted. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended\u00a0August 31, 2025\u00a0and the related management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\") have been filed and are available for review on\u00a0the SEDAR+ website at\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n. The financial statements and the MD&A are also available on the Company's website at\nwww.orosur.ca\n.\nA link to the PDF version of the financial statements is available here:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/6451E_2-2025-10-23.pdf\nA link to the PDF version of the MD&A is available here\n:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/6451E_1-2025-10-23.pdf\nHIGHLIGHTS\nHighlights for the three months ended August 31, 2025 include:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nIn Colombia\n, on July 14, 2025,\nthe Company announced that it had taken the formal decision to begin a work program that, if successful, would allow a Mineral Resource Estimate to be calculated at its Pepas gold prospect, within the Anz\u00e1 gold project area in\u00a0Colombia. The decision was taken on the basis of external conceptual studies that suggest the location and physical characteristics of the gold mineralisation so far defined at Pepas, in the context of record high gold prices, may offer potential nearer term production opportunities. The in-fill drilling program continued throughout the quarter and post the period end and may be\nfollowed by a Mineral Resource Estimate and an evaluation of the economics for production at Pepas. Thereafter the Company will return to wider exploration drilling, including at APTA.\nEarlier stage\nexploration continues at\u00a0the El Cedro\u00a0prospect. The\u00a0El Cedro\u00a0prospect is a large gold porphyry system, located toward the south of the Anz\u00e1 project, on the same granted exploration licence as the Pepas and APTA deposits. The Company recommenced a large ridge and spur soil sampling program at El Cedro that had been previously suspended due to seasonal rain and access issues. This program has continued beyond the period end and is now 90% complete.\n\u00b7\nIn Argentina\n, earlier this year the Company\nannounced the successful completion of the first phase of the two-phase exploration joint venture over the El Pantano gold project in\u00a0Santa Cruz\u00a0province,\u00a0Argentina\u00a0(\"Project\" or \"El Pantano\"). This milestone marked a significant step forward in the Company's strategic development of the Project. Having invested\u00a0US$1m\u00a0over three years, the Company has now earned a direct 51% interest in the Argentine company, Deseado Dorado S.A.S (\"Deseado\"), that owns the exploration licences that make up the Project. The Company has now moved into the second phase of the JV, that will see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional\u00a0US$2m\u00a0over two years. Upon such an outcome, the original vendors would then retain a residual 2% NSR royalty, 1% of which the Company could repurchase at its election for\u00a0US$1m.\nA geophysical campaign was completed during the quarter with the objective of further refining targets at the Project where drilling is expected to commence imminently with a 3,000 metre program of diamond drilling.\n\u00b7\nIn Nigeria\n,\u00a0given the continued weakness in the price of lithium and in view of the Company's need to prioritise the use of its capital and human resources, a decision has been taken to withdraw from the project which should happen over the next few weeks. The investment in Nigeria was fully impaired in the Company's financial statements as at May 31, 2025.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nOn August 31, 2025, the Company had a cash balance of $3,906 (May 31, 2025 $4,877). As at the date of this MD&A and including the funds raised in the private placement (detailed below), the Company had a cash balance of $17.2 million.\n\u00b7\nPost period end,\non September 18, 2025 the Company announced an upsized brokered private placement (the \"Placing\") to raise gross proceeds of up to CAD$ 20 million through the issue of up to 58,823,530 common shares at a price of CAD$0.34 per common share. The Placing, which was over- subscribed, was completed on October 2 2025 and raised CAD$ 20 million. No warrants were issued in connection with the Placing.\nOutlook and Strategy\nThe Company will focus its investment in Colombia and Argentina whilst also looking for new opportunities in South America.\nIn Colombia, within the Anza Project, the Company is looking to complete its in-fill drilling program at Pepas which would allow Maiden Resource Estimate to be completed at Pepas. Thereafter the Company will continue to investigate the possibility of a resource estimate at its APTA prospect whilst it refines its geological models around Pepas to identify poss",

All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two, non-contiguous pieces (Figure 2).\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA. In parallel, mapping and sampling is being undertaken over the El Cedro porphyry system in the south of the project area.\nFigure 3.

(\"\nOrosur\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (\nTSX-V/AIM:OMI\n) is pleased to announce the closing of its previously announced and oversubscribed \"best efforts\" private placement offering (the \"\nOffering\n\") for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately C$20,000,000, which includes the full exercise of the agents' option for gross proceeds of C$2,000,000. Under the Offering, the Company sold an aggregate of 58,823,530 common shares of the Company (the \"\nShares\n\") at a price of C$0.34 per Share (being approximately GBP \u00a30.1809 at an exchange rate of GBP \u00a31.88 to CAD).\nRed Cloud Securities Inc. (\"\nRed Cloud\n\"), lead agent and sole bookrunner, and Paradigm Capital Inc. (together with Red Cloud, the \"\nAgents\n\") acted as agents in connection with the Offering. In consideration for their services, the Agents received a cash commission of C$809,995.80. Turner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd, Greenwood Capital Partners Limited (collectively, the \"\nU.K. Brokers\n\") and the Company's Nominated Adviser, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (\"\nSP Angel\n\"), acted as brokers in connection with a portion of the Offering in the United Kingdom. In consideration of their services, the U.K. Brokers and SP Angel received aggregate cash commissions and fees of \u00a3274,807.44 (equivalent to C$516,638).\nIn accordance with National Instrument 45-106 -\nProspectus Exemptions\n(\"\nNI 45-106\n\"), 36,764,706 Shares were sold to purchasers resident in Canada pursuant to the listed issuer financing exemption under Part 5A of NI 45-106 as amended by Coordinated Blanket Order 45-935 -\nExemptions from Certain Conditions of the Listed Issuer Financing Exemption\n. Such Shares are not subject to a hold period under Canadian securities laws.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering principally to advance the Company's Anz\u00e1 exploration project in Colombia as well as for general working capital and corporate purposes.\nApplication has been made for the 58,823,530 Shares, which rank\npari passu\nwith the existing common shares in issue, to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will occur at 8:00 a.m. (UK time) on or around October 3rd, 2025.\nThe closing of the Offering remains subject to the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nRelated Party Transaction\nAs part of the Offering, 1832 Asset Management L.P. (\"\n1832\n\") through investment funds it advises has subscribed for 4,412,000 Shares. The participation in the Offering by 1832, a substantial shareholder in the Company, constitutes a related party transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies and within the meaning of TSX-V Policy 5.9 (the \"\nPolicy\n\") and Multilateral Instrument 61-101-\nProtection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions\n(\"\nMI 61-101\n\") adopted in the Policy.

The Board, all of whom are considered Directors independent of the Offering, consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP, that the participation by 1832 is fair and reasonable insofar as the shareholders of the Company are concerned.\nFollowing the closing of the Offering, 1832 will have a beneficial interest in 44,027,000 Shares, representing approximately 11.5% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing the closing of the Offering and exercise of warrants totaling 581,500 from the Company's block listing announced January 8, 2025 for a total consideration of\nC$145,375\nand for the purposes of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, the Company will have 385,163,924 Shares in issue.

All dollar figures are stated in thousands of US$ unless otherwise noted. The audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended May 31, 2025; the related management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\"); and Forms 52-109FV1 will be filed today and be available for review on the SEDAR+ website at www.sedarplus.ca.

(\"Monte Aguila\") as a result of which the Company now has 100% ownership of the Company's flagship Anz\u00e1 Gold Project. The Company also re-took operatorship of the Anza Gold Project, commencing a drilling program at the Pepas prospect in late November 2024 which is still continuing and has produced some exceptional results, all of which have been announced by the Company since that date.\nWhile exploration continues across several prospects at Anz\u00e1, the Company feels that the nature of the gold mineralisation thus far defined at Pepas, could, if proven, underpin a range of development options. Consequently, the Company has begun examining the potential for nearer term production at Pepas, initially through an in-fill drilling programme, followed by a Mineral Resource Estimate and an evaluation of the economics for production at Pepas. Thereafter the Company will return to wider exploration drilling, including at APTA.\nIn the meantime, earlier stage\nexploration continues at\u00a0the El Cedro\u00a0prospect, which lies to the south of the same integrated licence that hosts Pepas, Pepas North and APTA and is roughly 4km south of the APTA base camp.\nWork on El Cedro began some years ago before Orosur's tenure, when Anglo American undertook reconnaissance mapping and sampling, identifying a highly prospective gold/copper porphyry system. Large soil samples have been taken at roughly 25m intervals, along ridges and spurs for ease of access and to ensure soils were residual.\u00a0Samples were sent to both\u00a0Medellin\u00a0and\u00a0Canada\u00a0for assay. Early assay results have been returned and show highly anomalous results over large areas along the eastern flank, with substantial areas of over 0.3 g/t Au in soils, and some samples in excess of 1 g/t Au and 0.5% Cu. A wider area is being sampled to more accurately define the background levels, however these early results are considered by Orosur to be highly encouraging.\nIn Argentina\n, on February 17, 2025, the Company\nannounced the successful completion of the first phase of the two-phase exploration joint venture over the El Pantano Project in\u00a0Santa Cruz\u00a0province,\u00a0Argentina. This milestone marks a significant step forward in the Company's strategic development of the Project. Having invested\u00a0US$1m\u00a0over three years, the Company has now earned a direct 51% interest in the Argentine company, Deseado Dorado S.A.S (\"Deseado\"), that owns the exploration licences that make up the Project. The Company can now move to the second phase of the JV, that could see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional\u00a0US$2m\u00a0over two years. Upon such an outcome, the original vendors would then retain a residual 2% NSR royalty, 1% of which the Company could repurchase at its election for\u00a0US$1m.\nPost period end, a geo-physical campaign comprising IP was shot over one of the more prospective parts of the Project area. The data was then interpreted to provide the preferred locations for drilling which will take place later this year subject to finance.\nIn Nigeria\n, the Company will consider how to best deal with the project given the continuing subdued lithium market.\nIn Uruguay\n, in accordance with the Creditors' Agreement, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Loryser has sold all of its assets. It has paid for the settlements with all of its former employees; it has finalised the reclamation and remediation works on the tailings dam and has successfully concluded a one-year post-closure control phase. It\nhas then distributed all remaining proceeds, via a Court approved paying agent, to Loryser's trade creditors and paid any remaining unclaimed amounts into the Court, in accordance with the Creditors' Agreement. Given that Loryser has fulfilled all of its obligations under the Creditors' Agreement, the Company\nhas extinguished the carrying amounts due to",

Recent results are largely as expected in terms of the grade distribution across Pepas. However, PEP055 unexpectedly intersected an extremely high-grade vein at a downhole depth of only 30m, well beyond the grades that have thus far been encountered. While only narrow (1.9m downhole width), this vein could be significant, and more work will be required to understand its extent and thus its geological and MRE significance.\nThe MRE infill drill program is ahead of schedule, and subject to a mid-program review, could be completed by late October 2025. Once complete, the rig will then move back to exploration, either around Pepas, or at the APTA prospect to better understand the newly evolving geological model there. This decision will be made in coming weeks.\nA comprehensive metallurgical test program is currently being developed for Pepas, with discussions underway with several laboratories in South and North America. These plans are hoped to be finalised soon, and it is anticipated that one or two wider diameter (PQ) metallurgical holes will be required to provide the necessary weight of material for testing.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP054\n20\n40.6\n20.6\n2.01\nincluding\n33.1\n39.6\n6.5\n3.29\nPEP055\n22.05\n69.3\n47.25\n15.25**\nIncluding\n27.85\n41.8\n13.95\n45.99**\nIncluding\n29\n30.9\n1.9\n303.25**\nPEP056\n6\n28.5\n22.5\n1.64\nincluding\n22.8\n28.5\n5.7\n3.78\nPEP057\n2.95\n4.85\n1.9\n1.19\n10.85\n18.3\n7.45\n3.05\nincluding\n10.85\n12.5\n1.65\n12.31\n29.8\n46.9\n17.1\n5.47\nincluding\n32.85\n41.1\n8.25\n8.85\nincluding\n35.8\n37.8\n2\n26.55\nPEP058\n9.75\n18.65\n8.9\n0.62\n32.95\n67.8\n34.85\n3.42\nincluding\n38.9\n59\n20.1\n4.7\nPEP059\n13.4\n27.6\n14.2\n0.75\nTable 1.

Section PEP056, 057, 058, 059\nCoarse Gold - PEP055\nThe quoted composite assay result from PEP055 of 47.25m @ 15.25g/t Au has been influenced by two consecutive high-grade samples across 1.9m in which visible gold was noted in core. These two consecutive samples returned 465.71g/t Au and 122.74g/t Au respectively. Outside these two samples, grades assayed were largely in line with adjacent holes.\nThe Company feels that these two samples represent a real, and very high-grade vein, but are also cognisant that coarse gold has the potential to create a sampling bias if incorrect sample preparation has resulted in heterogenous distribution of gold throughout the sample.\nTo assess the potential impact of this, pulps from these two samples were re-assayed twice, with reasonably consistent results (table 2). The Company is therefore confident that no significant sampling bias has occurred. Geologically however, such high-grade samples are a statistical outlier and will require further understanding so that their impact on a MRE is accurately reflected.\nSample\nOriginal assay\nRe-assay 1\nRe-assay 2\nSample 1 - 1m\n465.71ppm\n453.19ppm\n478.23ppm\nSample 2 - 0.9m\n122.74ppm\n121.16ppm\n124.33ppm\nTable 2.

This program is now roughly 45% complete, and it is expected that the remainder of the program should be completed by mid-October 2025.\nThe first batch of 40 samples from the restarted program have been submitted for assay this week, with results expected soon.\nEl Pantano - Argentina\nThe El Pantano Project is an early-stage gold/silver exploration project in Santa Cruz province, southern Argentina.\nThe Project comprises approximately 550km2 of contiguous licences in the prolific Deseado Massif region, roughly 45km from Anglo Gold's Cerro Vanguardia mining camp.\nThe El Pantano Project is subject to an Exploration & Joint Venture (\"JV\") agreement (\"Agreement\") with private Argentinean company DESEADO DORADO S.A.S and its shareholders (\"Deseado\"), the details of which were announced on February 15th 2022. The Company has earned a 51% interest in the El Pantano Project and must spend an additional US$2m in the two years from Feb 14th, 2025, in order to earn 100% ownership.\nThe Company has been carrying out regional exploration at El Pantano for several years, including geological mapping, geochemical sampling, ground magnetics and induced polarisation geophysical surveys. These work programs have provided evidence suggestive of major rift-related low sulphidation epithermal system, of the type that has led to the development of major gold and silver deposits in the region.\nDrill permits for El Pantano were obtained late in 2024, and the Company is now finalising drill contracts with a view to commencing drilling in mid-October 2025, the first drill program that has ever been undertaken anywhere on the property.\nBetween 10 and 14 diamond holes are planned for a total of approximately 3000m, targeting geological structures and geochemical/geophysical anomalies identified from previous work.

This program has been designed with the multiple objectives of infilling previous drilling, expanding beyond current drilling to define the boundaries, and understanding the geological controls upon mineralisation and the variations in geology and grade across the deposit.\nHoles will be drilled in an order that attempts to address these issues concurrently.\nAs a result of the shallow nature of mineralisation, holes are generally short, taking between three and four days to complete on average. When the Company reassumed control of the Project in December 2024, samples were shifted to a fire-assay laboratory facility in Medellin, that has consistently provided 3-4 days turnaround of assay results. The Company is thus currently averaging roughly one hole per week with only one rig - an exceptionally fast rate of progress by industry standards.\nThese three holes announced today are a continuation of this infill program and have all returned exceptional results (most especially PEP047), with thick sequences of high-grade gold mineralisation commencing from surface.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP047\n0\n104\n104\n6.61\nincluding\n5\n41.6\n36.6\n10.23\nincluding\n83.05\n98.45\n15.4\n10.3\nPEP048\n0\n32.3\n32.3\n3.65\nincluding\n5\n27.8\n22.8\n4.51\nPEP049\n0\n94.2\n94.2\n3.74\nincluding\n0\n6.65\n6.65\n7.27\nincluding\n17.85\n40.35\n22.5\n5.61\nincluding\n61.55\n82.15\n20.6\n5.04\nTable 1. Latest drill Intercepts, Pepas Prospect\nInfill drilling is ongoing, but the recent holes are already beginning to provide greater understanding of the genesis of Pepas and, as importantly, grade distribution which will be vital for mine planning studies.\nWhile drilling continues, in the near term, the Company will soon begin to undertake additional studies on such issues as metallurgy, mining planning and logistics, so that Pepas can be advanced as quickly as possible post its maiden MRE.\nFigure 2.

This sampling program was roughly 1/3 complete when it had to be suspended due to road damage sustained from an unusually wet season in the region. Rains have now abated, and this road damage has been repaired such that Company geological crews will be returning to El Cedro this week to recommence this program.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The latest results at Pepas continue to impress. While size remains to be defined, the picture of Pepas as a highly lucrative mining proposition is rapidly solidifying. We are increasingly confident that there is a commercially viable opportunity at Pepas and so we will very soon commence non-drill related studies to begin the process of advancing Pepas toward development.\"\nColombia - ANZ\u00c1 Project\nThe Anz\u00e1 Project is now 100% owned by the Company following completion of a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), announced 28th November 2024, whereby the Company purchased all of the shares of its previous JV partner; Minera Monte Aguila (\"MMA\").\nThe Project, which is located 50km west of Medellin, is easily accessible and boasts excellent infrastructure including water, power and communications as well as a large exploration camp.\nFrom September 2018 to November 2024, the Anz\u00e1 Project was under the control of its previous JV partner MMA, itself a 50/50 venture between the world's two largest gold miners, Agnico Eagle Mines and Newmont Mining.\nProspects\nThe Company is currently focussed on three prospects within th",

Mid-Cauca Belt\nProspects\nThe Company is currently focussed on three prospects within the Anz\u00e1 Project - Pepas, APTA and El Cedro. All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two, non-contiguous pieces (Figure 2).\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA. In parallel, mapping and sampling is being undertaken over the El Cedro porphyry system in the south of the project area.\nFigure 2. Main prospects, licences pre-MMA acquisition\nPepas Prospect\nPepas was discovered by MMA in late 2021 by BLEG sampling and geological mapping, followed by 11 diamond drill holes in 2022 (PEP001 to PEP011).\nAfter completion of the transaction to buy MMA (\"Transaction\"), the Company restarted drilling at Pepas in late-November 2024.\nDrilling commenced with hole PEP012, which was positioned to confirm previous high-grade results in holes PEP001, PEP005 and PEP007 drilled in 2022.\nFigure 3. Plan of holes\nDrilling at Pepas, post Transaction, has largely concentrated on a small central core, where a body of high-grade gold mineralisation is being defined from surface. Additional drilling has also been undertaken around this central core to understand the wider geological context and as the commencement of a larger scale exploration program.\nOf the nine holes discussed in this announcement, six (PEP038 to PEP043) were drilled around but outside the Pepas core, while three (PEP044 to PEP046) have been drilled as part of the previously announced infill program that is designed to move Pepas to a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE).\nPEP038 was drilled to the north at what is referred to as Pepas North. This was the third of three holes drilled here as the first move to this area, following up positive surface geochemical results. This hole was drilled orthogonal to the two previous holes, to provide the maximum lithological and structural information. PEP038 returned a result of 16.8m @ 0.68g/t Au. As with the two previous holes in this vicinity, this hole demonstrates the scale of the epithermal system that hosts Pepas and has provided valuable information to understand the controls of this system.\nPEP039 was a speculative exploration hole drilled a substantial distance to the south and west of the Pepas core, following up zones of surface silicification. No substantial results were returned.\nPEP040 was drilled outside the known Pepas envelope to the SW, to test lower-level shallow mineralisation previously identified by earlier drilling. The hole returned a small intersection of 10.25m @ 1.35g/t Au from surface (figure 4) that indicates the potential for a body of satellite mineralisation, adjacent to the Pepas core, that will require additional follow up.\nFigure 4. PEP040 and PEP046 section\nPEP041 was drilled outside the currently known Pepas envelope to the north to test the northward extension of the mineralisation first identified by earlier drilling undertaken by the Company's previous JV partner MMA. This hole returned a positive intersection of 31.75m @ 2.01 g/t Au, opening this area for potential extension (figure 5).\nFigure 5.

The Company is confident that both exploration and resource definition streams can be run in parallel within the limits of the Company's financial, human and technical resources. The primary impact is that the single drill rig currently employed on the Project has been diverted toward infill drilling within the current boundary of known high grade gold mineralisation at Pepas. During this time, geological studies and additional surface field work will be undertaken at Pepas and other prospects so that targets are ready for the rig to move back to regional exploration once the resource infill is completed.\nColombia - ANZ\u00c1 Project\nThe Anz\u00e1 Project is now 100% owned by the Company following completion of a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), announced 28th November 2024, whereby the Company purchased all of the shares of its previous JV partner; Minera Monte Aguila (\"MMA\").\nThe Project, which is located 50km west of Medellin, is easily accessible and boasts excellent infrastructure including water, power and communications as well as a large exploration camp.\nThe Project sits within the prolific mid-Cauca belt, Colombia's primary gold belt, and is located along strike between several world class gold/copper deposits including Buritica, Quebradona and Guayabales/Marmato (Figure 1).\nFrom September 2018 to November 2024, the Anz\u00e1 Project was under the control of its previous JV partner MMA, itself a 50/50 venture between the world's two largest gold miners, Agnico Eagle Mines and Newmont Mining.\nFigure 1. Mid-Cauca Belt\nProspects\nThe Company is currently focussed on three prospects within the Anz\u00e1 Project - Pepas, APTA and El Cedro. All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two non-contiguous pieces (Figure 2).\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA. In parallel, mapping and sampling is being undertaken over the El Cedro porphyry system in the south of the project area.\nPepas and North Pepas Prospects\nThe Pepas prospect is in the far north of the Anz\u00e1 project and was discovered by the Company's previous JV partners, MMA, in late 2021 by BLEG sampling and geological mapping, followed by 11 diamond drill holes in 2022 (PEP001 to PEP011).\nAfter completion of the transaction to buy MMA, the Company restarted drilling at Pepas in late-November 2024.\nDrilling commenced with hole PEP012, which was positioned to confirm previous high-grade results in holes PEP001, PEP005 and PEP007 drilled in 2022.\nSince reassuming control of the Project in December 2024, the Company has released assay results from 26 holes (PEP012 to PEP037), most of which were concentrated in and around the central core of near-surface high-grade gold mineralisation.\nFigure 3. Plan of holes, core Pepas zone.\nThis small, but thick and high-grade zone of mineralisation has developed very quickly since the Company reassumed control, and while the surrounding areas remain largely unexplored, the Company feels that what has thus far been defined is worthy of economic study, especially in the current gold price environment.\nGeological Modelling and Economic Studies\nAs previously announced, encouraged by the exceptional results at the Pepas prospect, the Company has begun the process of geological modelling and preliminary economic assessment at Pepas.\nThe characteristics of Pepas that encouraged the Company to begin the process of conceptual study are its high grade, surficial nature, thickness, availability of power to site, proximity to the main regional highway without having",

All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two, non-contiguous pieces (Figure 2).\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA. In parallel, mapping and sampling is being undertaken over the El Cedro porphyry system in the south of the project area.\nFigure 2. Main prospects, licences pre-MMA acquisition\nPepas and North Pepas Prospects\nPepas was discovered by MMA in late 2021 by BLEG sampling and geological mapping, followed by 11 diamond drill holes in 2022 (PEP001 to PEP011).\nAfter completion of the transaction to buy MMA, the Company restarted drilling at Pepas in late-November 2024.\nDrilling commenced with hole PEP012, which was positioned to confirm previous high-grade results in holes PEP001, PEP005 and PEP007 drilled in 2022.\nNorth Pepas is an area several hundred metres north of Pepas where anomalous rock chip and soil geochemistry has indicated a zone of interest.\nFigure 3. Plan of holes\nDrilling at Pepas, post transaction, has largely concentrated on a small central core, where a body of high-grade gold mineralisation is being defined from surface.\nHole PEP033 was drilled at the southern extent of Pepas, to gradually extend mineralisation in this direction. A thick intersection of high-grade mineralisation (21.3m @ 5.88 g/t Au) was identified from surface, suggesting potential for extension of Pepas toward the south that will require follow-up.\nHole PEP034 was drilled internal to the existing Pepas mineralised body, but orthogonal to previous drilling, and sub parallel to the Tesorito South fault, to test continuity of mineralisation from section to section and to assist in future resource modelling. A thick intersection of extremely high-grade mineralisation (59m @ 10.15g/t Au) was identified, adding substantially to the geological understanding of the Pepas body.\nHole PEP035 was drilled in the centre of Pepas, but toward the west, outside the previous mineralised envelope, to test the depth extension of previous surface mapping. The positive response from this hole (11.4m @ 2.71g/t Au) has opened up the potential for additional extensions in this direction.\nPepas North was identified as an area of potential several hundred metres to the north of Pepas, by virtue of a number of highly anomalous rock chip and channel samples.\nHowever, these samples, while highly anomalous, contained little geological or orientation contextual information, and thus initial drilling here was unguided.\nTwo holes PEP036B and PEP037 were drilled as a scissor pair underneath previously defined geochemical anomalies.\nBoth holes intersected thick sequences of highly altered and silicified tuffs, with moderate gold mineralisation similar in nature to the lower grade halo zones identified around Pepas to the south. This is potentially suggestive that these holes may be marginal to a more mineralised system. Both also intersected numerous structurally complex zones, with some indication of having been drilled sub-parallel to the controlling strike.\nA third hole, PEP038 has been collared orthogonal to these first two holes to provide additional structural and lithological i",

Orosur Mining Inc. (\"Orosur\" or \"the Company\") (TSX-V/AIM: OMI) the minerals developer and explorer with operations in Colombia, Argentina and Nigeria,\nannounces its unaudited results for the quarter ended February 28th, 2025. All dollar figures are stated in US$ unless otherwise noted.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended February 28th, 2025 and the related management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\") have been filed and are available for review on\nthe SEDAR+ website at www.sedarplus.ca. The financial statements and the MD&A are also available on the Company's website at\nwww.orosur.ca\n.\nA link to the PDF version of the financial statements is available here:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/3087G_2-2025-4-25.pdf\nA link to the PDF version of the MD&A is available here\n:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/3087G_1-2025-4-25.pdf\nHIGHLIGHTS\nOperational and financial highlights for the quarter ended February 28th, 2025 are set out below:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nIn Colombia\n, on November 27, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Minera Monte Aguila S.A.S. (\"Monte Aguila\") as a result of which the Company now has 100% ownership of the Company's flagship Anz\u00e1 Gold Project. The Company also re-took operatorship of the Anza Gold Project, commencing a drilling program at the Pepas prospect in late November 2024 which is still continuing and has produced some exceptional results, the details of which can be found in the Company's news releases on its website at\nwww.orosur.ca\n.\nIn addition, on February 4, 2025, the Company announced that, following some surface sampling to the area immediately north of Pepas (\"Pepas North\"),\na number of areas of mineralised material have been identified, with one large area along a small walking track exposing saprolite and semi-fresh rock. Over 100m of mineralisation was identified at surface, with samples taken at 1m intervals over the entire length of the exposure. Assay results averaged 1.15g/t Au over 105m, with individual samples at times exceeding 5g/t Au. This channel sample is at the southern extreme of the new Pepas North anomalous area, but over 200m north of the limit of current drilling.\nThe Company is expected to commence drilling Pepas North during Q4 2025.\n\u00b7\nIn Argentina\n, on February 17, 2025, the Company\nannounced the successful completion of the first phase of the two phase exploration joint venture over the El Pantano gold project in\u00a0Santa Cruz\u00a0province,\u00a0Argentina\u00a0(\"Project\" or \"El Pantano\"). This milestone marks a significant step forward in the Company's strategic development of the Project. Having invested\u00a0US$1m\u00a0over three years, the Company has now earned a direct 51% interest in the Argentine company, Deseado Dorado S.A.S (\"Deseado\"), that owns the exploration licences that make up the Project. The Company can now move to the second phase of the JV, that could see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional\u00a0US$2m\u00a0over two years. Upon such an outcome, the original vendors would then retain a residual 2% NSR royalty, 1% of which the Company could repurchase at its election for\u00a0US$1m.\nPost period end, a geo-physical campaign commenced with the objective of refining targets after which the Company will consider drilling, likely to take place later in 2025 subject to funding.\n\u00b7\nIn Nigeria\n, the Company will look to make some advances on its lithium project, but at a slower pace whilst lithium prices continue to recover.\n\u00b7\nIn Uruguay\n, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Loryser, continues to focus its activities on the final stages of the Creditors Agreement. In line with the Creditors Agreement, Loryser has sold all of its assets. It has paid for the settlements with all of its former employees; it has finalised the reclamation and remediation works on the tailings dam and has successfully concluded a one-year post-closure control phase.\nLoryser is well advanced in distributing the proceeds to Loryser's trade creditors in accordance with the Creditors' Agreement, via a Court approved settlement agent.\nFinancial and Corporate\n\u00b7\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost method except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are accounted for as Assets and Liabilities held for sale (at the lower of book value or fair value) and Profit and Loss from discontinuing operations. This accounting treatment has been applied to the activities in Uruguay and Chile.\n\u00b7\nAt the Company's AGM, held on December 12, 2024\nall resolutions put to shareholders were duly passed.\n\u00b7\nOn December 19, 2024, the Company\nannounced that it had raised the sum of\u00a0\u00a31.25 million\u00a0(before expenses) through a placing of 18,939,394 ne",

Mid-Cauca Belt\nProspects\nThe Company is currently focussed on three prospects within the Anz\u00e1 Project - Pepas, APTA and El Cedro. All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two, non-contiguous pieces (Figure 2).\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA. In parallel, mapping and sampling is being undertaken over the El Cedro porphyry system in the south of the project area.\nPost the MMA acquisition in late November 2024, the Company more than doubled its land holding in the mid-Cauca belt to 400km2, by virtue of gaining ownership of a large number of licence applications held by MMA. This makes the Company one of the major land holders in one of the world's most exciting gold belts.\nThese applications have yet to be properly assessed by the Company as most financial and management resources have thus far been directed to drilling at Pepas.\nFigure 2. Main prospects, licences pre-MMA acquisition\nPepas Prospect\nPepas was discovered by MMA in late 2021 by BLEG sampling and geological mapping, followed by 11 diamond drill holes in 2022 (PEP001 to PEP011).\nAfter completion of the transaction to buy MMA, the Company restarted drilling at the Pepas prospect in late-November 2024.\nDrilling commenced with hole PEP012, which was positioned to confirm previous high-grade results in holes PEP001, PEP005 and PEP007 drilled in 2022.\nMost drilling conducted to date by the Company has focussed on a central, high-grade core around the first discovery holes. This has been an intentional strategy based on several rationale:\n\u00b7\nTo understand the mineralisation and its litho-structural controls.\n\u00b7\nTo allow time for surface mapping and sampling to expand the anomalous zone and provide targets.\n\u00b7\nTo allow time for permits and physical access to be developed to other parts of the prospect.\n\u00b7\nTo examine the potential of moving a small part of Pepas to resource status which could be beneficial in the context of the Colombian permitting system and a pre-existing environmental exploitation permit over part of these licences.\nFigure 3. Plan of holes\nPEP028 was drilled at the northern extend of the central core, as a scissor hole to PEP015, (Figure 4) to define the position of the Tesorito South fault and thickness of transported cover in this location. This was necessary to assist in moving toward a resource if future results warrant. This hole confirmed previous drilling and recorded a thick sequence of medium grade mineralisation.\nFigure 4. Section, PEP028 and PEP015\nHoles PEP029 and PEP030 were drilled from the same pad, some distance from the central core and likely NW of the primary geological trend, testing a different geological horizon and several mildly anomalous outcrops. Both intersected thick sequences of lower grade mineralisation. Both of these holes and other work, suggest the potential for a large, reasonably consistent low-grade halo of roughly 0.3g/t Au around a higher-grade core.\nHole PEP031B was the redrill of PEP031 which became stuck in broken ground. This hole was drilled in the SE of the prospect, slightly off trend to test the downdip extension of a large moderate-grade silicified outcrop that was interpreted",

Mid-Cauca Belt\nProspects\nThe Company is currently focussed on three prospects within the Anz\u00e1 Project - Pepas, APTA and El Cedro. All three prospects are within the same granted exploration title that is broken into two, non-contiguous pieces (Figure 2).\nDrilling is currently being undertaken at the Pepas prospect in the northern extent of the Anz\u00e1 Project (pre-acquisition) over 10km north of the central base camp at APTA.\nPost the MMA acquisition in late November 2024, the Company more than doubled its land holding in the mid-Cauca belt to 400km2, by virtue of gaining ownership of a large number of licence applications held by MMA. This makes the Company one of the major land holders in one of the world's most exciting gold belts.\nThese applications have yet to be properly assessed by the Company as most financial and management resources have thus far been directed to drilling at Pepas.\nFigure 2. Main prospects, licences pre-MMA acquisition\nPepas Prospect\nPepas was discovered by MMA in late 2021 by BLEG sampling and geological mapping, followed by 11 diamond drill holes in 2022 (PEP001 to PEP011).\nAfter completion of the transaction to buy MMA, the Company restarted drilling at the Pepas prospect in late-November 2024.\nDrilling commenced with hole PEP012, which was positioned to confirm previous high-grade results in holes PEP001, PEP005 and PEP007 drilled in 2022.\nLater holes were then rotated clockwise from PEP012 to begin to test what was considered by Company geological teams to be the controlling trend of SE to NW. The primary objective of the first phase of drilling by the Company was to attempt to understand the geological controls upon mineralisation first identified in 2022, so as to provide guidance for later step out drilling.\nHoles drilled and announced to date (PEP012 to PEP027) have all intersected substantial sequences of gold mineralisation, largely from surface, thus far manifested as a thick wedge of silicified tuffs within the keel of two converging faults. Chemical analysis suggests the mineralisation to be possibly a variant of a high sulphidation epithermal style, but with just over 1100m drilled thus far, there is yet insufficient information to fully define its genesis, structural controls or source. By definition, this style of mineralisation, is the shallower expression of a deeper source, which has yet to be examined as drilling has focussed on the high grade near surface material.\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nOf these current five holes, two (PEP023 and PEP024) were drilled some distance from the currently defined core deposit, to test a small, medium grade outcrop of silicified material. Moderate intersections were recorded in complex series of veins in a different domain to previous drilling. This opens up a new target and will require more work.\nHole PEP025 was drilled on section with PEP014, 021 and 022, to complete this section and to better define a central high-grade core around which a future resource might be developed.\nHole PEP026 was drilled in the NW end underneath the discovery hole PEP001, to test a structure identified in early drilling. Broken ground was intersected in shallower sections, before a substantial gold intersection lower in the hole.\nPEP027 was drilled beyond the SE margin of previous dril",

This milestone marks a significant step forward in the Company's strategic development of the Project.\nHaving invested US$1m over three years, the Company has now earned a direct 51% interest in the Argentine company, Deseado Dorado S.A.S (\"Deseado\"), that owns the exploration licences that make up the Project.\nThe Company can now move to the second phase of the JV, that could see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional US$2m over two years. Upon such an outcome, the original vendors would then retain a residual 2% NSR royalty, 1% of which the Company could repurchase at its election for US$1m.\nEl Pantano is an early-stage gold/silver exploration project in\u00a0Santa Cruz\u00a0province, southern\u00a0Argentina. The Project comprises a number of contiguous, granted exploration licences totalling some 560km2 in the prolific Deseado Massif geological province. The Deseado Massif plays host to a number of world class gold and silver deposits, including Newmont's Cerro Negro mine and Anglo Gold's Cerro Vanguardia operation.\nThe Project was in an early-stage, greenfield state, having seen little or no historical exploration before commencement of the JV in early 2022. However, Company geological teams felt the Project held enormous potential on the basis of regional geological data, suggestive of the presence of a large epithermal system.\nOver the last three years, the Company's geological teams have been methodically undertaking base level geoscience surveys including ground magnetics, geological mapping and surface geochemistry.\u00a0These data support the rift-related low-sulphidation epithermal model, with identification of a 25km long rift structure with pervasive silicification, quartz veining and geochemical anomalism over a huge area.\nThe Company is to soon commence induced polarisation surveys (\"IP\") designed to define silicified drill targets.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"\nWe are delighted to have reached this key stage in the Exploration Agreement. In particular we see the work to date as tremendous testament to the value of back to basics, grass roots exploration - taking an unwanted, untouched region, doing the work, and transforming it into a huge and extraordinarily exciting prospect in a world class province at a time of record gold prices. Together with our partners we are starting to prepare for Phase 2 of the Project, and we look forward to accelerated exploration activities\"\nFor further information, visit\nwww.orosur.ca\n, follow on X @orosurm or please contact:\nOrosur Mining Inc\nLouis Castro, Chairman,\nBrad George, CEO\ninfo@orosur.ca\nTel:\n+1 (778) 373-0100\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP - Nomad & Joint Broker\nJeff Keating / Jen Clarke / Devik Mehta\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd\n-\nJoint Broker\nAndy Thacker/James PopeTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nFlagstaff Communications and Investor Communications\nTim ThompsonMark EdwardsFergus Mellon\norosur@flagstaffcomms.com\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 ('MAR') which has been incorporated into UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Anz\u00e1 Project - prospects\nPepas was discovered by MMA in late 2021 by BLEG sampling and geological mapping, followed by 11 diamond drill holes in 2022 (PEP001 to PEP011).\nAfter completion of the transaction to buy MMA, the Company restarted drilling at the Pepas prospect in mid-November 2024.\nDrilling commenced with hole PEP012, which was positioned to confirm previous high-grade results in holes PEP001, PEP005 and PEP007 drilled in 2022.\nLater holes were then rotated some 51 degrees clockwise from PEP012 to begin to test what was considered by Company geological teams to be the controlling trend of SE to NW. The primary objective of the first phase of drilling by the Company was to attempt to understand the geological controls upon mineralisation first identified in 2022, so as to provide guidance for later step out drilling.\nHoles drilled and announced to date (PEP012 to PEP018) have all intersected thick sequences of gold mineralisation, that seem to be bounded on each side by two faults that converge at depth (Tesorito North and Tesorito South faults). Recent drilling continues to improve the geological understanding of the lithostructural architecture of the mineralised zone.\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nHoles PEP019 and PEP020 were both drilled from the same pad in the SE of the mineralised zone to test continuity of mineralisation and to examine some additional structures that had been identified at surface in this location (Figure 3).\nBoth holes entered broken ground at shallow depth, potentially indicative of a N-S fault that will require more examination. The fault zone, however, was substantially mineralised, with the holes recording high quality intersections of 44.3m @ 1.63g/t Au and 54.65m @ 1.94 g/t Au respectively, both from surface.\nFigure 3. Section, PEP019 and PEP020\nHoles PEP021 and PEP022 were drilled from the same pad, on section with PEP014 in the centre of the mineralised zone, but in the opposite direction to PEP014, to define the nearly identified Tesorito South fault, which thus far had only been intersected at a very shallow angle in holes PEP016 and PEP018.\nBoth holes entered high grade gold mineralisation immediately from surface, which continued at a consistent level until intersection of the Tesorito South fault (Figure 4).\nThe holes returned exceptional gold intersections of 107.05m @ 6.22g/t Au and 76.3m @ 7.24g/t Au respectively, both from surface.\nFigure 4 Section PEP021 and PEP022\nHole PEP022 encountered a second fault toward the bottom of the hole, possibly indicative of a small N-S fault, intersected at a shallow angle. This fault zone was mineralised to a low level of less than 0.3g/t Au but was included in the above quoted composite intersection as it was felt its thickness may have been exaggerated due to the shallow angle of intersection. If this fault zone were removed from calculation, the composite intersection of PEP022 would instead be 62.95m @ 8.73g/t Au, from surface.\nDrill intersections for these four holes are as follows:\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP019\n0\n44.30\n44.3\n1.63\nincluding\n8.7\n17.5\n8.8\n3.35\nPEP020\n0\n54.65\n54.65\n1.94\nincluding\n47.0\n54.65\n6.75\n4.51\nPEP021\n0\n107.05\n107.05\n6.22\nincluding\n23.2\n47.05\n23.85\n13.67\n82.25\n86.45\n4.2\n15.31\n98.55\n105.9\n7.35\n9.2\nPEP022\n0\n76.3\n76.3\n7.24\nincluding\n20.55\n34.45\n13.9\n8.72\n37.25\n56\n18.75\n17.02\n58.4\n62.95\n4.55\n9.11\nTable 1.

Orosur Mining Inc. (\"Orosur\" or \"the Company\") (TSX-V: OMI) (AIM: OMI) the minerals developer and explorer with operations in Colombia, Argentina and Nigeria,\nannounces its unaudited results for the quarter ended November 30, 2024. All dollar figures are stated in US$ unless otherwise noted.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended November 30, 2024 and the related management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\") have been filed and are available for review on\nthe SEDAR+ website at www.sedarplus.ca. The financial statements and the MD&A are also available on the Company's website at\nwww.orosur.ca\n.\nA link to the PDF version of the financial statements is available here:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/1875V_1-2025-1-29.pdf\nA link to the PDF version of the MD&A is available here\n:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/1875V_2-2025-1-29.pdf\nHIGHLIGHTS\nOperational and financial highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2024 are set out below:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nIn Colombia\n, on November 27, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Minera Monte Aguila S.A.S. (\"Monte Aguila\") as a result of which the Company now has 100% ownership of the Company's flagship Anz\u00e1 Gold Project. Under the terms of the acquisition, Orosur's wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Waymar Resources Ltd., purchased all of the issued shares of Monte Aguila from wholly owned subsidiaries of Newmont and Agnico resulting in Orosur regaining 100% ownership of the Project. No cash is payable up front, with all consideration deferred and wholly contingent upon commercial production from the Anza Project. The agreed consideration is a net smelter royalty of 1.5% on all future mineral production, plus a capped fixed royalty of an aggregate amount of US$75 per ounce of gold or gold equivalent ounce on the first 200,000 gold equivalent ounces of mineral production. Completion of the acquisition was subject to customary conditions including the approval of the TSXV, which conditions have all been met. The Company also re-took operatorship of the Anza Gold Project, commencing a drilling program at the Pepas prospect in late November 2024 which has extended post quarter end with very good results.\n\u00b7\nIn Argentina\n, the Company has completed and submitted all the necessary environmental studies that are required as part of the\u00a0Santa Cruz Province\u00a0drilling permit process. Consideration of these reports and drilling approval was expected to take several months. The Company has now received the approval necessary for drilling. A further geo-physical campaign is planned to refine targets after which the Company will consider drilling, likely to take place later in 2025 subject to funding.\n\u00b7\nIn Nigeria\n, the Company will look to make some advances on its lithium project, but at a slower pace whilst lithium prices continue to recover.\n\u00b7\nIn Uruguay\n, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Loryser, continues to focus its activities on the final stages of the Creditors Agreement. In line with the Creditors Agreement, Loryser has sold all of its assets. It has paid for the settlements with all of its former employees; it has finalised the reclamation and remediation works on the tailings dam and has successfully concluded a one-year post-closure control phase.\nLoryser is well advanced in distributing the proceeds to Loryser's trade creditors in accordance with the Creditors' Agreement, via a Court approved settlement agent.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost method except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are accounted for as Assets and Liabilities held for sale (at the lower of book value or fair value) and Profit and Loss from discontinuing operations. This accounting treatment has been applied to the activities in Uruguay and Chile.\n\u00b7\nOn September 30th, 2024, the Company announced that it had raised the sum of\u00a0\u00a3835,000\u00a0(before expenses) through a placing of 30,035,971 new common shares of no par value at a price of\u00a02.78 pence\u00a0per Placing Share, together with a grant of one unlisted warrant to purchase one additional common share exercisable at\u00a0US$0.0494\u00a0(approximately 3.697p) for every two Placing Shares subscribed for.\n\u00b7\nOn November 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $945,000 (May 31, 2024 $2,104,000). As at the date of this announcement the Company has a cash balance of $2,200,000.\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars)\nUnaudited\nAs at\nNovember 30, 2024\n$\nAs at\nMay 31,\n2024\n$\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash\n945\n1,328\nRestricted cash\n12\n12\nAccounts receivable and other assets\n391\n279\nAssets held for sale in Uruguay\n",

Anz\u00e1 Project - prospects\nPepas was discovered by MMA in late 2021 by BLEG sampling and geological mapping, followed by 11 diamond drill holes in 2022 (PEP001 to PEP011).\nOn completion of the transaction to buy MMA, the Company restarted drilling at the Pepas prospect in mid-November 2024.\nDrilling commenced with hole PEP012, which was positioned to confirm previous high-grade results in holes PEP001, PEP005 and PEP007 drilled by MMA in 2022.\nLater holes (PEP013 to PEP015) were then rotated some 51 degrees clockwise from PEP012 to begin to test what was considered by Company geological teams to be the controlling trend of SE to NW. The primary objective of the first phase of drilling by the Company was to attempt to understand the geological controls upon mineralisation first identified in 2022, so as to provide guidance for later step out drilling.\nHoles PEP012 to PEP015 (previously announced) all intersected thick sequences of high-grade gold mineralisation (table 2), and importantly, intersected a well-defined basement fault that could be correlated from hole to hole and thus provide clear guidance as to orientation.\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nHoles PEP016 and PEP017 were both drilled downdip of previous holes, but at opposing ends of the current mineralised zone, in order to test additional structural complexities that were anticipated to the SW and to begin creating several drill sections to aid in interpretation. PEP018 was then drilled up dip of and on section with holes PEP013 and PEP017.\nBoth PEP016 and PEP017 intersected loose and broken ground from surface, likely as a result of both holes being drilled through and sub-parallel to a large fault zone running parallel to the known basement fault and converging at depth. Drilling within this zone was difficult, with poor recoveries, such that PEP017 was abandoned, and redrilled as PEP017B from the same pad, with slightly shallower dip so as to exit the fault zone earlier.\nSome evidence of the existence of this fault had been noted in surface mapping and these holes were designed to test its location and nature to gain a better understanding of the mineralisation.\nOnce leaving the fault zone, both holes entered the mineralised zone and recorded substantial intersections of gold mineralisation.\nPEP018 was drilled immediately up dip of PEP013 to extend the exceptional results recorded in this previous hole. PEP018 entered high grade mineralisation from surface, which continued until intersection of the expected basement fault.\nDrill intersections for these three holes are as follows:\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP016\n61.6\n105.3\n43.7\n3.13\nincluding\n61.6\n76.25\n14.65\n8.09\nPEP017\n56.1\n96.3\n40.2\n2.06\nincluding\n56.1\n64.15\n8.05\n4.42\nincluding\n74.35\n78.6\n4.25\n8.3\nPEP018\n0\n54.1\n54.1\n6.01\nincluding\n5.4\n29.15\n23.75\n9.07\nTable 1. Drill Intercepts\nFigure 3. Section, PEP016\nFig 4 Section PEP017B\nDiscussion and ongoing drilling\nHoles PEP016, PEP017, and PEP018 are adding to the geological picture in the centre of the Pepas zone.\nThe holes drilled since the Company took control of the Project less than six weeks ago, have confirmed the Company's assertion that previous drilling in 2022, while successful in discovering Pepas, did not resolve the orientation of the mineralisation as most holes were drilled sub-parallel to what is now thought to be the primary orientation.\nHoles PEP016 and PEP017 were drilled with the joint objectives of increasing the understanding of the litho-structural framework of the deposit, with specific focus on a fault that was expected in the SW of the area. A geological picture is beginning to emerge of the current body of mineralisation sitting within the keel of two roughly parallel faults that converge at depth with a southerly plunge.\nHole PEP018 was drilled up di",

Will it be a JV and if so, which project and who with?  Will it be exciting news on North Pepas?  News on the second Rig?  Updates on aeromags?   Will it be the  much awaited MRE?  Update on foreward plan?  Combination of these?  How many RNSs will we get?  Combined or separate updates? There are all these possibilities (and no doubt more).  $15 million to spend and with numerous irons in the fire (and more being added)!  2025 was a belter, but already in the first few weeks of 2026, barring any black swan type of event, you can just sense that this year is going to be one heck of a ride.",

PM, Miners, Gold & Silver. If no RNS tomorrow my guess is the SP will rise anyway, perhaps tomorrow 2-3p in anticipation of big news next week, it really will be FOMO Friday.

It may be that we're big enough these days to say that one hole showing gold and/or silver at El Pantano doesn't materially affect OMI's asset base, and the BoD doesn't want a spike in the share price to trigger a sell-off.  At the same time/on the other hand, it could be argued that releasing an excellent first hole (or first three holes) is misleading if the next three are duds, and which has to be expected from a first campaign in an undrilled land holding.  So the optimistic take is that the first holes are good enough that the BoD feels like they can't release what they've got until they have the full set of results and can confirm that they didn't just have one or two lucky strikes at the start of the campaign.  This could be the market's position, and why we're seeing the price rise.  If so, I'm not sure it's fully priced in yet. This January campaign is supposed to be broad and focused on geology, so I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to release all of the results together, along with some big picture analysis.  That would likely be in mid/late Feb.  A bit annoying, but hopefully the Pepas MRE comes sooner and we don't lose momentum.  I can't see Brad doing a deal on any of the current assets besides APTA; there's too much scope for near-term value appreciation, but of course that depends on what he's being offered.",

A ridiculously low CAPEX and AISC, against a rising gold price is a phenomenal and unrivalled situation for ANY junior to find itself in.  Pepas is literally screaming out for production and is a no brainer.  But the MRE is needed to underpin this. You THEN have to look at the ridiculous upside potential, from one or more of the following actual or high probability events: 1) Pepas itself containing over $1 billion worth of gold. 2) Finding more Pepas's and/or the source - arguably a high probability event given the geology and the $15 million to drill surrounding areas. 3) The existing discovery at APTA going to MRE - an actual event and estimated to be at least 2moz. 4) The probability of making a huge discovery at El P - arguably a high probabiltiy event given the geology, early signs, and $15 million. 5) The probability of making huge discoveries at El Cedro and LV - greenfield projects but the geology is very favourable. 6) Getting into the GDXJ - a very high probability event the way things are going.  Maybe as early as March 2026. At the moment, our valuation doesn't reflect ANY of the above.  So, we should get an uplift on the Pepas MRE (though not the same as when we near production).  But from there, we only need ONE of the remaining events to happen to start another move up. I believe the likes of Sprott, Dynamic, Durrett and the other instis, and investors like Baron, are seeing and buying for this bigger picture - and that's where their \"20-50 bagger\" or \"\u00a32 in 2026\" projections are coming from. That MRE will only solidy this and it will be game on for such a move from that point onwards.  All imho but let's see!  Will be one heck of ride for sure - and a very rewarding one.",

As such the market makers stitch them up with quotes 10-20% under/over the official closing bid/ask. If anyone has the ear of the CEO/Chair, they might want to run it past them, but fairly sure that I am correct.",

Its possible that GGP may end up in both indices. Van Eck are notoriously difficult to communicate with and they dont always adhere to their own rules. For that reason I would never invest in either of these two tickers or in any other VE product.",

Additionally, countries\u2014especially China, but also Russia, India, Turkey, and others\u2014have been buying large amounts of gold mainly for financial security, strategic independence, and risk management. The key reasons are: 1. Reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar. Gold is a neutral reserve asset that isn\u2019t controlled by any one country. Holding less in U.S. dollars or U.S. Treasury bonds reduces exposure. to: U.S. monetary policy Sanctions Dollar inflation or debt risks China, in particular, wants to avoid relying too heavily on a currency issued by a geopolitical rival. 2. Protection against sanctions Gold cannot be frozen or blocked the way foreign bank accounts or dollar reserves can. After Russia\u2019s dollar and euro reserves were frozen in 2022, many countries took that as a warning. Gold stored domestically is especially hard for foreign governments to touch. 3. Hedge against inflation and currency instability Gold tends to hold its value over long periods, especially during: * High inflation * Currency devaluation * Financial crises Emerging markets often face more currency volatility, so gold acts as insurance. 4. Diversification of reserves Central banks don\u2019t want all their reserves in: One currency. One country\u2019s debt. Gold adds balance to portfolios alongside dollars, euros, and other assets. 5. Preparing for a More Fragmented Global System The world is moving toward a multipolar financial system, not dominated solely by the U.S. Gold supports: *   Regional trade systems *   Local-currency trade agreements *   Potential alternatives to the dollar-based system (even if slowly) Confidence and signaling: Large gold reserves signal: * Financial strength * Long-term stability * Monetary credibility For China, it also supports confidence in the yuan as it tries to expand its global use. Bottom line Countries are buying gold because it is: *   Politically neutral *   Sanction-resistant *   Inflation-resistant *   A long-term store of value",

What does this delay mean given that they had core samples in hand early December?  Maybe the lab results were not great and the December RNS of \"substantial mineralisation found\" is deemed to be enough for the market until they could re-direct the drills during Jan?  Or, the bullish case, the results were so good Brad had to call and tell Newmont what they have found, and that has triggered JV talks.  All speculation of course, just trying to figure out the delay.",

He would just keep his head down. Im hoping they come next week but who knows we have all guessed at different times and all have been wrong. Legals not getting excited as sp only up around 50%  to 60%in last few weeks.  I hope doc a bit more excited Im very excited but then Im not a shareholder am I by some. With the Canadian conference next week it would be a good time to announce something big to market and then go sell it to them.  Everything is speculation atm but things really getting exciting here, hey Doc warming up nicely. Lots of news to come in next month or so.   Another 3 weeks drilling at El pantano and thats that done while they examine where to drill next.  Very exciting times ahead.  Good luck all.",

It's just that following any rise, I also get excited when I see a decent consolidation, because I know it will build the basis for another leg up.  So they are two sides of the same coin, and I like to see both! As for lack of EP results, it's maybe worth listening back to the last Q&A.  The lab that OMI were originally going to use 6 hours away and was going to  provide a quick turnaround and do fire assays for gold.  However, because they observed \"substantial silver\", it was decided to send the assays to a lab that was much further away, but would be able to assay for silver and pathfinder elements.  BG did say that they did not want to release one set of assay results and then a second set of results on the same holes.  They wanted to release in one go. Therefore, I don't know if they need to use both labs, one after the other?  If so, then that will explain the delay as they are likely waiting on the second lab? But if only using a single lab - BG said it was \"possible\" that first results would come in after Xmas.  So a bit of leeway there?",

At 13 p we were going to be 30 p on next news according to you. Bought 10 down . Same at selling at around 26 p when it. If it doesn\u2019t re trace that\u2019s fine, banking a bit at 6 bags isn\u2019t exactly bad ! Anyway, backtick you Wsbn and your other great prediction when buying at \u00a31.85 Still bullish 26 Sep 2025 11:28 We didn't get the strong open we wanted. Clearly lots of profit taking, which is to be expected as this has multibagged already for many. The uptrend is still intact and it's a case of finding the new support/consolidation level from which supply will be absorbed and then the uptrend will resume. This is exactly how it was during the previous leg up. It's how the market moves. Some of the profit takers will be buying back in at the lows - which is sort of where we're at. As long as we continue to consolidate at a higher level than before, we're good. It will then only be a matter of short time before we end the pause and resume the uptrend. Accordingly, i've added in this consolidation even though i'm already in profit. Until the uptrend is broken, i'm expecting more upside, or at least the probabilities favour that outcome. \u2028\u2028As we have seen here already several times, sentiment changes in a flash, and all we need is the emergence of a green candle, whether on the 15 mins, hourly, or daily, and sentiment will resume towards the positive and the share price will stir back into life. All imho and dyor Friday FOMO 26 Sep 2025 07:12 You can certainly feel the excitement growing on this BB. Does very much feel like we might be about to take off again here. 1.85p seems ridiculously cheap for what\u2019s happening at Red Setter.",

I can see the share price going on to much higher levels based on all the newsflow that is coming up here.  It's just a matter of time for me before that previous recent high gets taken out. Just wait for the MRE to land - that will give the instis something more concrete to hang their hats on for a higher valuation.  I believe they will take us into the GDXJ and onto further insti interest that comes with such membership.  That would be the smart thing for the likes of Sprott etc to do! Will hope to be there when it happens....",

It may be that we're big enough these days to say that one hole showing gold and/or silver at El Pantano doesn't materially affect OMI's asset base, and the BoD doesn't want a spike in the share price to trigger a sell-off.  At the same time/on the other hand, it could be argued that releasing an excellent first hole (or first three holes) is misleading if the next three are duds, and which has to be expected from a first campaign in an undrilled land holding.  So the optimistic take is that the first holes are good enough that the BoD feels like they can't release what they've got until they have the full set of results and can confirm that they didn't just have one or two lucky strikes at the start of the campaign.  This could be the market's position, and why we're seeing the price rise.  If so, I'm not sure it's fully priced in yet. This January campaign is supposed to be broad and focused on geology, so I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to release all of the results together, along with some big picture analysis.  That would likely be in mid/late Feb.  A bit annoying, but hopefully the Pepas MRE comes sooner and we don't lose momentum.  I can't see Brad doing a deal on any of the current assets besides APTA; there's too much scope for near-term value appreciation, but of course that depends on what he's being offered.",

          "content": "I think the Pepas MRE will be a 'watershed moment' for OMI's valuation and share price.  A ridiculously low CAPEX and AISC, against a rising gold price is a phenomenal and unrivalled situation for ANY junior to find itself in.  Pepas is literally screaming out for production and is a no brainer.  But the MRE is needed to underpin this. You THEN have to look at the ridiculous upside potential, from one or more of the following actual or high probability events: 1) Pepas itself containing over $1 billion worth of gold. 2) Finding more Pepas's and/or the source - arguably a high probability event given the geology and the $15 million to drill surrounding areas. 3) The existing discovery at APTA going to MRE - an actual event and estimated to be at least 2moz. 4) The probability of making a huge discovery at El P - arguably a high probabiltiy event given the geology, early signs, and $15 million. 5) The probability of making huge discoveries at El Cedro and LV - greenfield projects but the geology is very favourable. 6) Getting into the GDXJ - a very high probability event the way things are going.  Maybe as early as March 2026. At the moment, our valuation doesn't reflect ANY of the above.  So, we should get an uplift on the Pepas MRE (though not the same as when we near production).  But from there, we only need ONE of the remaining events to happen to start another move up. I believe the likes of Sprott, Dynamic, Durrett and the other instis, and investors like Baron, are seeing and buying for this bigger picture - and that's where their \"20-50 bagger\" or \"\u00a32 in 2026\" projections are coming from. That MRE will only solidy this and it will be game on for such a move from that point onwards.  All imho but let's see!  Will be one heck of ride for sure - and a very rewarding one.",

All dollar figures are stated in US$ unless otherwise noted.\nThe unaudited condensed interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended November 30th, 2025 and the related management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\") have been filed and are available for review on\nthe SEDAR+ website at www.sedarplus.ca. The financial statements and the MD&A are also available on the Company's website at\nwww.orosur.ca\n.\nTo view the PDF version of the financial statements please click here:\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/2400Q_2-2026-1-23.pdf\nTo view the PDF version of the MD&A, please click here\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/2400Q_1-2026-1-23.pdf\nBoth PDF version's of the MD&A and financial statements is available here\n:\nwww.orosur.ca\nHighlights\nHighlights for the three months ended November 30th, 2025 include:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nIn Colombia\n, during the whole quarter,\ninfill drilling has continued at its Pepas gold prospect in Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\".) As anticipated, drilling\nresults have firmed up the Pepas deposit and provided better definition of the nature of the thick, high-grade mineralisation. Recent results are largely as expected in terms of the grade distribution across Pepas.\nThe MRE at Pepas is anticipated to be delivered by the end of January 2026.\nAt El Cedro, some 10kms to the south of Pepas but on the same licence, the Company completed a large-scale soil geochemical survey covering most of what is thought to be a large scale porphyry system. Soil samples were taken at roughly 25m intervals, along ridges and spurs for ease of access and to ensure soils were residual. The survey showed gold assay results identifying a substantial, gold bearing system, with highly anomalous geochemical responses over a large, well preserved zoned porphyry system, with soil samples assays at times exceeding 1g/t Au.\nIn addition, analysis of\nnew geochemical data, in conjunction with historical mapping information and airborne geophysical data collected in 2012 has identified a second porphyry system to the south of El Cedro within the same structural regional corridor.\n\u00b7\nIn Argentina\n,\nthe Company has earned a direct 51% interest in the Argentine company, Deseado Dorado S.A.S (\"Deseado\"), that owns the exploration licences that make up the El Pantano Project in Santa Cruz province. The Company has now moved into the Phase 2 of the JV, that will see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional\u00a0US$2m, a large part of which will be spent on a 3,000 metre drill program which commenced at El Pantano in November and is expected to conclude in early 2026.\nFirst holes from\u00a0the El Pantano\u00a0drilling program confirm a low sulphidation epithermal mineral system. Whilst assays are still awaited, the Company is confident that it has achieved its general objective of proving the existence of a substantial mineral system.\n\u00b7\nIn Nigeria\n,\u00a0in view of the Company's need to prioritise the use of its capital and human resources, a decision was taken to withdraw from the lithium project which will be formalized over the next few weeks. The investment in Nigeria was fully impaired in the Company's financial statements as at May 31, 2025 and it remains fully impaired.\nFinancial and Corporate\n\u00b7\nOn November 30, 2025, the Company had a cash balance of US$16,280,000 (May 31, 2025 US$4,877,000). As at the date of this MD&A and including the funds raised in the private placement (detailed below), the Company had a cash balance of US$14,920,000.\n\u00b7\nO\nn September 18, 2025 the Company announced an upsized brokered private placement (the \"Placing\") to raise gross proceeds of up to CAD$20 million through the issue of up to 58,823,530 common shares at a price of CAD$0.34 per common share. The Placing, which was over- subscribed, was completed on October 2 2025 and raised CAD$20 million. No warrants were issued in connection with the Placing.\n\u00b7\nPost the period end, at the Company's AGM held on December 17, 2025\nall resolutions put to shareholders were duly passed.\n\u00b7\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost method except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are accounted for as Assets and Liabilities held for sale (at the lower of book value or fair value) and Profit and Loss from discontinuing operations. This accounting treatment has been applied to the activities in Uruguay and Chile.\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Financ",

The discussion re El Cedro at mins 6-10 in the November interview ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ZnaIec-jw) went over my head at the time, but now seems like a clear statement from Brad that his strategy for 2026 is to try and find a big project that will attract someone like Newmont. As he says, Pepas isn't that project, but they pursued it to get the market support to get the money for exploration, which is exactly what OMI received in the last big raise.  That's why the APTA timeline has dragged, because they no longer need that MRE to get the share price up, so it's not a priority.  El Cedro is looking like a Q2 drill target rather than Q1, what with the aeromag delays, but Brad does seem to think it could be a million-ouncer, and that's why it's getting prioritised.  El Pantano, one hopes, might fall into the same category, but I think they know less about it at the moment.",

Needs to be pulled together into a coherent story.\"  He's been stressing since drilling began that the goal was only to get a sense of the geology, rather than target the best hits.  They've rejigged how the assays are being tested, seemingly because they were seeing both gold and silver, so it seems unlikely the results are bad, and it's been confirmed that they found the sort of banding they were looking for.  The neutral case is that no one's had time to sit down and do the analysis on what the assays mean, and that's why they've not been released.  The hard bullish case is that they're already in talks about a JV or sale and the other party wants the results sat on.  That seems less likely, but either way, it's just a waiting game.",

Worked out well for the 'NFT's'... Non-Fungible Tokens??... And it's unlikely old money would let new money have control anyway. Although BTC looks like it will have a small place in the world finances. You won't find any hackers being able to steal your physical gold, especially those sweating behind a computer screen in their mums basement. No tin foil hat here. Mine's a hat made of pure gold.

We are only in January and there is SO much exciting newsflow to come here during the rest of the year, regardless of the macros.  There is every chance that new discoveries will be announced and we are on the verge of such at El P and North Pepas.  We also have guaranteed world class drilling results to come from APTA, which is about to be drilled to MRE. So whether the share price goes up, down, or sideways on the MRE, it will sure as hell be bouncing towards new highs on the newsflow to come in the weeks and months ahead.  Of that I am very confident.  OMI appears to have the midas touch when it comes to its projects.  Pepas is the smallest but perhaps tastiest, but the big hitters are yet to come.  Have to be here when those projects start to come home and for the biggest gains. Do not give your shares away too cheaply or prematurely.  Many have done already, and are no doubt regretting bailing out too early. 40p is a level we should all be relatively comfortable with and remain firmly sitting on those hands.  But we've told many this already and folk will do what comes most easily to them.  All good and GLA for whatever you do around the MRE!",

Brad maybe waiting for more drill results to confirm what could be in Argentina. Its been 6 weeks since drill results maybe they not come back yet but why would Brad say drill results after Christmas.  he did not say drill results in Feb or later if there was a massive back log i think he may have indicated back log in a post on X just to let everyone know.

Then the next ones should be blockbusters. Whats mad is the fact people are talking of gold pulling back massively...  As it sits comfortably above $5k... Even if it went back to $4k it wouldn't effect Pepas's forward moving plans to production. I'd guess even at $2k gold Pepas would be viable, especially for a small fry like Orosur. The share price seems to have settled around the 36p mark for now. Let see how TSX react, but i reckon by end of play we'll be either around the open price or in the blue.",

Then we have news on multiple fronts MRE in Feb Drill results from El Pantao Maybe drill results from Pepas North new area at Pepas which Brad thinks could be more Pepas here Then in April or may infill drilling at Apta Then later in year drilling at El Cedro And who knows we may get a JV on one of these sites while gold moves towards 6,000 and possibly beyond.

Yes the price is slightly down, just like many stocks today, there may be a slight delay with the MRE but that is nothing unusual. Omi is a fantastic company with huge potential and you should take this opportunity whilst the price is a little lower to get onboard because it won't be at this level for much longer.",

The discussion re El Cedro at mins 6-10 in the November interview ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ZnaIec-jw) went over my head at the time, but now seems like a clear statement from Brad that his strategy for 2026 is to try and find a big project that will attract someone like Newmont. As he says, Pepas isn't that project, but they pursued it to get the market support to get the money for exploration, which is exactly what OMI received in the last big raise.  That's why the APTA timeline has dragged, because they no longer need that MRE to get the share price up, so it's not a priority.  El Cedro is looking like a Q2 drill target rather than Q1, what with the aeromag delays, but Brad does seem to think it could be a million-ouncer, and that's why it's getting prioritised.  El Pantano, one hopes, might fall into the same category, but I think they know less about it at the moment.",

Maybe an offer (I would only entertain a \u00a31 billion+ offer) everything is pointing to OMI ramping up into a huge success story, the big mining Co have huge piles of surplus cash, they can easily justify the investment in this climate, and make a minimum 15:1 return on their investment.

Bottom line is we are after \"measured (& indicated)\" which should convert to bookable reserves as soon as feasibility studies are completed and final investment decisions are made to commence mining. Paper value assigned to each ounce gets closer to true value as the uncertainty reduces.

Needs to be pulled together into a coherent story.\"  He's been stressing since drilling began that the goal was only to get a sense of the geology, rather than target the best hits.  They've rejigged how the assays are being tested, seemingly because they were seeing both gold and silver, so it seems unlikely the results are bad, and it's been confirmed that they found the sort of banding they were looking for.  The neutral case is that no one's had time to sit down and do the analysis on what the assays mean, and that's why they've not been released.  The hard bullish case is that they're already in talks about a JV or sale and the other party wants the results sat on.  That seems less likely, but either way, it's just a waiting game.",

Worked out well for the 'NFT's'... Non-Fungible Tokens??... And it's unlikely old money would let new money have control anyway. Although BTC looks like it will have a small place in the world finances. You won't find any hackers being able to steal your physical gold, especially those sweating behind a computer screen in their mums basement. No tin foil hat here. Mine's a hat made of pure gold.

We are only in January and there is SO much exciting newsflow to come here during the rest of the year, regardless of the macros.  There is every chance that new discoveries will be announced and we are on the verge of such at El P and North Pepas.  We also have guaranteed world class drilling results to come from APTA, which is about to be drilled to MRE. So whether the share price goes up, down, or sideways on the MRE, it will sure as hell be bouncing towards new highs on the newsflow to come in the weeks and months ahead.  Of that I am very confident.  OMI appears to have the midas touch when it comes to its projects.  Pepas is the smallest but perhaps tastiest, but the big hitters are yet to come.  Have to be here when those projects start to come home and for the biggest gains. Do not give your shares away too cheaply or prematurely.  Many have done already, and are no doubt regretting bailing out too early. 40p is a level we should all be relatively comfortable with and remain firmly sitting on those hands.  But we've told many this already and folk will do what comes most easily to them.  All good and GLA for whatever you do around the MRE!",

There\u2019s no doubt that is the plan\u2026.. that is why they went after PEPAS south first. Maybe not the biggest deposit but open pit mining, high grade deposit meaning low AISC. Near roads so it can be refined nearby using toll payments with low capex and so a quicker route to production (no plant to build and commission) and so a quick route to generating cash\u2026. It\u2019s just all so very \u2026. Sensible",

OMI are already planning to toll Pepas so why not build the plant at the bigger deposit and use Pepas ore to start with whilst drilling out and preparing the deeper bigger ore site??

High-grade (from surface), low-tonnage potential that should \u2014 all going well \u2014 return multiples of the current market cap. This will probably take 2\u20133 years to come to fruition and start delivering those returns. It's a great long-term investment case in my opinion. I think the institutional investors agree. It's often stated that \"where there is gold, there is more\"\u2026 and as Brad has said, \"we've only just scratched the surface\u2026 we haven't even begun to look deep.\" Initially, I invested here because of Pepas and the potential for another deposit of this type. I haven't lost any optimism about the prospect of finding Pepas North \u2014 in fact, I've only grown more confident. So remember: regardless of the distractions caused by short-term price fluctuations (whether in the metals market or OMI's share price) and the emotions they may trigger for investors watching the hourly/daily/weekly charts, our deposits have been forming over millions of years\u2026 and just like me, they aren't going anywhere.",

          "content": "This applies to OMI I think. \u201cNot exactly. Broadly speaking, as a gold prospect generator, that view might hold \u2014 but let me explain, because there are several factors at work. At the point where true value is first created \u2014 the \u201cHAD005 moment\u201d, when you actually discover gold \u2014 the share price is leveraged partly to the gold price and partly to market perception and expectations. At that stage, the share price reflects value in the ground, which itself depends on multiple new variables: size and grade how big the system is location and, critically, the realistic probability of becoming an economic mine Many projects fail. Many mines fail. Above all, however, the share price reflects the market\u2019s confidence in management\u2019s ability to deliver a mine or project. That\u2019s precisely why GGP\u2019s share price fell so hard while De Grey\u2019s didn\u2019t fall as badly in 2022. Once you become a gold producer, everything changes. The key difference is that you can now leverage your balance sheet and cash flow against both operational performance and the gold price. You\u2019re no longer forced to rely on debt. You can: fund project development internally, accelerate projects , discover additional ounces, consolidate assets , acquire complementary projects In short, production gives you control \u2014 and that\u2019s where sustained value creation really begins. GGP's SP exploded once it became clear GGP management had control. A wise and called Rusty Delroy once said 8 or 9 /10ths of any junior miner or developers value /market cap is essentially the market's confidence that they will deliver. This is easily demonstrated by Solgold was recently sold for \u00a3850m whereas GGP is today worth some \u00a34.5bn and pumping out $ billions in revenue. But yet solgold had over 24moz of gold - versus GGPs 3 moz. Funny that don't you think. Serious investors (ie the market) felt Solg management were un-investable.\u201d",

It could just be the MRE has taken longer than anticipated in getting it finalised. And The El Pantano drill campaign will be completed and released in one RNS. I find it weird twitters gone silent ish, I expected images of the aero mag helicopter over El Cedro / Apta by now. Maybe they are having a serious discussion whether to attack surround Pepas, El Cedro and Apta all at once in a massive ramp up.

Low 30s I may add again, I questioned my previous buys around 22p at the time that they may have been abit daft. It\u2019s been almost double that price\u2026 I get the feeling 30s will seem a bargain basement price fairly soon. Tick tock.",

This has caused mining and processing projects worldwide to stall or fail, weakening supply chain resilience and threatening economic and security interests. The administration views this as a shared international problem that requires coordinated action among allies. To address this, the United States outlines a strategy centred on reindustrialisation, securing end-to-end supply chains and rebuilding domestic mining and processing capacity. Measures include large-scale public financing, direct investment in mining and processing projects, accelerated permitting, creation of strategic mineral stockpiles and protection of domestic producers from unfair price competition. A key proposal is the creation of a preferential critical minerals trade zone among allied countries, featuring enforceable price floors and coordinated trade measures to stabilise markets, support investment and prevent market flooding. The goal is to diversify global supply, ensure predictable pricing and strengthen partner economies while reducing dependence on concentrated or unreliable sources. Japan strongly supports these objectives, highlighting its own efforts to diversify supply, invest upstream and downstream and enhance economic security through legislation, public-private financing and international cooperation. Japan stresses that resilience can only be achieved collectively and welcomes new forums for coordination such as FORGE. U.S. officials further outline four pillars of action: investing in mining projects, stockpiling critical minerals, protecting producers from market distortions and rebuilding the mining ecosystem through regulatory reform and workforce development. The overarching message is a shift from discussion to execution, with the United States seeking broad international participation to build resilient, secure and diversified critical mineral supply chains that support long-term global prosperity and security.",

The Company has now moved into the Phase 2 of the JV, that will see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional US$2m, a large part of which will be spent on a 3,000 metre drill program which commenced at El Pantano in November and is expected to conclude in early 2026. First holes from the El Pantano drilling program confirm a low sulphidation epithermal mineral system. Whilst assays are still awaited, the Company is confident that it has achieved its general objective of proving the existence of a substantial mineral system.",

In the end the control premium was modest as the larger holders bent over. Our directors have very modest holdings in OMI ( last time I looked I had more than our Chairman and CEO combined) so I suspect they are keen to maintain control for a number of years to monetize what looks like an attractive portfolio of opportunities. We have few large blocks last time I looked which could  be persuaded by the offer of a \u2018modest\u2019 premium like 40% when the journey is really just starting. Never say never but highly unlikely IMO that an offer  for the whole will be tabled at this stage as it would probably have to be hostile and could be well defended. Much more likely is a JV on El P and Brad is probably just waiting for the PM markets to calm down a little to release the MRE on Pepas which should show very impressive economics for a relatively modest capital commitment. Perhaps the BOD have received interest on both El P and El Cedro and have been discussing the optimum outcome along with ensuring that the structure of any JV with Newmont or Agnico will not come back to bite us as is sadly seen with too much frequency these days. I expect news this week either way.",

Brad says have they found a discovery he says no but we have found a mineralisation system.  he said they are happy with what they have seen but need to find if its economic, as I said they only drilled a few holes so cant say until they have figures however they are very bullish with what they have seen to date. Brad also says he is expecting drill results before Christmas but if not then after Christmas never mentions Feb which is a million miles away from just after christmas. Personally i think the delay in playing into our hands because by now hopefully they may have more drill results bak and getting a better idea of figures.  All good in my book but until we definitely know figures its all guess work or speculation from us all.",

Brad maybe waiting for more drill results to confirm what could be in Argentina. Its been 6 weeks since drill results maybe they not come back yet but why would Brad say drill results after Christmas.  he did not say drill results in Feb or later if there was a massive back log i think he may have indicated back log in a post on X just to let everyone know.  We ll find out sooner or later but my guess its in Feb 2026 keeping my options open.",

Even if it went back to $4k it wouldn't effect Pepas's forward moving plans to production. I'd guess even at $2k gold Pepas would be viable, especially for a small fry like Orosur.

Yes the price is slightly down, just like many stocks today, there may be a slight delay with the MRE but that is nothing unusual. Omi is a fantastic company with huge potential and you should take this opportunity whilst the price is a little lower to get onboard because it won't be at this level for much longer.",

The discussion re El Cedro at mins 6-10 in the November interview ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ZnaIec-jw) went over my head at the time, but now seems like a clear statement from Brad that his strategy for 2026 is to try and find a big project that will attract someone like Newmont. As he says, Pepas isn't that project, but they pursued it to get the market support to get the money for exploration, which is exactly what OMI received in the last big raise.  That's why the APTA timeline has dragged, because they no longer need that MRE to get the share price up, so it's not a priority.  El Cedro is looking like a Q2 drill target rather than Q1, what with the aeromag delays, but Brad does seem to think it could be a million-ouncer, and that's why it's getting prioritised.  El Pantano, one hopes, might fall into the same category, but I think they know less about it at the moment.",

Maybe an offer (I would only entertain a \u00a31 billion+ offer) everything is pointing to OMI ramping up into a huge success story, the big mining Co have huge piles of surplus cash, they can easily justify the investment in this climate, and make a minimum 15:1 return on their investment.

Needs to be pulled together into a coherent story.\"  He's been stressing since drilling began that the goal was only to get a sense of the geology, rather than target the best hits.  They've rejigged how the assays are being tested, seemingly because they were seeing both gold and silver, so it seems unlikely the results are bad, and it's been confirmed that they found the sort of banding they were looking for.  The neutral case is that no one's had time to sit down and do the analysis on what the assays mean, and that's why they've not been released.  The hard bullish case is that they're already in talks about a JV or sale and the other party wants the results sat on.  That seems less likely, but either way, it's just a waiting game.",

I\u2019ve heard that companies often provide timelines by essentially guessing the timeframe, because in many cases it\u2019s impossible to know how long things will take. A rough deadline is often considered better than no deadline at all, otherwise investors might panic. Even the best explorers fail to deliver on on tume most of the time. I dont understand why so many of you pay such close attention to deadlines",

Worked out well for the 'NFT's'... Non-Fungible Tokens??... And it's unlikely old money would let new money have control anyway. Although BTC looks like it will have a small place in the world finances. You won't find any hackers being able to steal your physical gold, especially those sweating behind a computer screen in their mums basement. No tin foil hat here. Mine's a hat made of pure gold.

We are only in January and there is SO much exciting newsflow to come here during the rest of the year, regardless of the macros.  There is every chance that new discoveries will be announced and we are on the verge of such at El P and North Pepas.  We also have guaranteed world class drilling results to come from APTA, which is about to be drilled to MRE. So whether the share price goes up, down, or sideways on the MRE, it will sure as hell be bouncing towards new highs on the newsflow to come in the weeks and months ahead.  Of that I am very confident.  OMI appears to have the midas touch when it comes to its projects.  Pepas is the smallest but perhaps tastiest, but the big hitters are yet to come.  Have to be here when those projects start to come home and for the biggest gains. Do not give your shares away too cheaply or prematurely.  Many have done already, and are no doubt regretting bailing out too early. 40p is a level we should all be relatively comfortable with and remain firmly sitting on those hands.  But we've told many this already and folk will do what comes most easily to them.  All good and GLA for whatever you do around the MRE!",

Then we can sit back and watch the following possibilities/probabilities take us even higher: - Any additonal discovery at Pepas - BOOM 2 - Any discovery at El P - BOOM 3 - Any JV announcement - BOOM 4 - Any strike at El C - BOOM 5 - MRE at Apta - BOOM 6 - Successful follow up at El P - BOOM 7 (Not necessarily all in this order) Some of these might result in a double BOOM!

          "content": "Hi Doc - a lot will depend on exactly when those catalysts land.  Some of the relevant factors might be: 1) What is gold doing at the time the particular catalyst lands? 2) What is the general market doing? 3) What is OMI's share price doing - consolidating, retracing or already on the move up?  (FOMO, sell on news, etc) 4) Has there already been another catalyst recently delivered to the market? 5) What other catalysts or news is pending at that time? There's no doubt that a new discovery at Pepas North will be a biggie.  But I also think that getting \"Pepas style\" results at APTA will move the share price needle, especially if they land in favourable market conditions.  It goes without saying that the same applies at El Cedro (huge project).  As for El P, we will need to wait to see what they have already found, and how close they are to a major discovery there, when they will target the discovery, as well as what JV interest they get. But plenty of fantastic share price drivers here, which is what makes this a very exciting and compelling share.  If the Pepas MRE can take us and provide us with a higher floor (whether much higher or slightly higher), then it sets us up very nicely for one or more of the multiple potential catalysts that we have coming up here to then drive us up to the next level.  That's the investment case here and it's just a case of letting it play out over the coming months and quarters.  Let's hope we get off to a cracking start with the Pepas MRE.  All imo and GLA",

Will it be one big RNS or multiple rns over this month and next and then drill results from Pepas North maybe come this month or next. Another rig will be moving to Apta where the grades there were outstanding so prity much guaranteed good results from them drill holes. Lots to look forward in this first six months for omi shareholders and then drilling will start at El Cedro.  In the mean time Brad will decide whats the next phase and when drilling will start again at El Pantano. Looks to be a mega year incoming which could see lots of shareholders very happy with the returns here.  Good luck all.",

There\u2019s no doubt that is the plan\u2026.. that is why they went after PEPAS south first. Maybe not the biggest deposit but open pit mining, high grade deposit meaning low AISC. Near roads so it can be refined nearby using toll payments with low capex and so a quicker route to production (no plant to build and commission) and so a quick route to generating cash\u2026. It\u2019s just all so very \u2026. Sensible",

OMI are already planning to toll Pepas so why not build the plant at the bigger deposit and use Pepas ore to start with whilst drilling out and preparing the deeper bigger ore site??

This will probably take 2\u20133 years to come to fruition and start delivering those returns. It's a great long-term investment case in my opinion. I think the institutional investors agree. It's often stated that \"where there is gold, there is more\"\u2026 and as Brad has said, \"we've only just scratched the surface\u2026 we haven't even begun to look deep.\" Initially, I invested here because of Pepas and the potential for another deposit of this type. I haven't lost any optimism about the prospect of finding Pepas North \u2014 in fact, I've only grown more confident. So remember: regardless of the distractions caused by short-term price fluctuations (whether in the metals market or OMI's share price) and the emotions they may trigger for investors watching the hourly/daily/weekly charts, our deposits have been forming over millions of years\u2026 and just like me, they aren't going anywhere.",

Broadly speaking, as a gold prospect generator, that view might hold \u2014 but let me explain, because there are several factors at work. At the point where true value is first created \u2014 the \u201cHAD005 moment\u201d, when you actually discover gold \u2014 the share price is leveraged partly to the gold price and partly to market perception and expectations. At that stage, the share price reflects value in the ground, which itself depends on multiple new variables: size and grade how big the system is location and, critically, the realistic probability of becoming an economic mine Many projects fail. Many mines fail. Above all, however, the share price reflects the market\u2019s confidence in management\u2019s ability to deliver a mine or project. That\u2019s precisely why GGP\u2019s share price fell so hard while De Grey\u2019s didn\u2019t fall as badly in 2022. Once you become a gold producer, everything changes. The key difference is that you can now leverage your balance sheet and cash flow against both operational performance and the gold price. You\u2019re no longer forced to rely on debt. You can: fund project development internally, accelerate projects , discover additional ounces, consolidate assets , acquire complementary projects In short, production gives you control \u2014 and that\u2019s where sustained value creation really begins. GGP's SP exploded once it became clear GGP management had control. A wise and called Rusty Delroy once said 8 or 9 /10ths of any junior miner or developers value /market cap is essentially the market's confidence that they will deliver. This is easily demonstrated by Solgold was recently sold for \u00a3850m whereas GGP is today worth some \u00a34.5bn and pumping out $ billions in revenue. But yet solgold had over 24moz of gold - versus GGPs 3 moz. Funny that don't you think. Serious investors (ie the market) felt Solg management were un-investable.\u201d",

Also Brad said that El Cedro was too big to go alone and the size of the area was 1,5km x1,5km or 1mile by 1m well El Pantano is 12 times that length by 3 times width.  And to find all this with just 3 months worth of drilling.  If the figures are as good as they think the sp should fly like Airforce 2. Something big must be brewing so the MRE in Pepas could be small fry in comparison to what could be happening in Argentina.  The drills could be stopping in Argentina in a week or two for now.

This has caused mining and processing projects worldwide to stall or fail, weakening supply chain resilience and threatening economic and security interests. The administration views this as a shared international problem that requires coordinated action among allies. To address this, the United States outlines a strategy centred on reindustrialisation, securing end-to-end supply chains and rebuilding domestic mining and processing capacity. Measures include large-scale public financing, direct investment in mining and processing projects, accelerated permitting, creation of strategic mineral stockpiles and protection of domestic producers from unfair price competition. A key proposal is the creation of a preferential critical minerals trade zone among allied countries, featuring enforceable price floors and coordinated trade measures to stabilise markets, support investment and prevent market flooding. The goal is to diversify global supply, ensure predictable pricing and strengthen partner economies while reducing dependence on concentrated or unreliable sources. Japan strongly supports these objectives, highlighting its own efforts to diversify supply, invest upstream and downstream and enhance economic security through legislation, public-private financing and international cooperation. Japan stresses that resilience can only be achieved collectively and welcomes new forums for coordination such as FORGE. U.S. officials further outline four pillars of action: investing in mining projects, stockpiling critical minerals, protecting producers from market distortions and rebuilding the mining ecosystem through regulatory reform and workforce development. The overarching message is a shift from discussion to execution, with the United States seeking broad international participation to build resilient, secure and diversified critical mineral supply chains that support long-term global prosperity and security.",

Our directors have very modest holdings in OMI ( last time I looked I had more than our Chairman and CEO combined) so I suspect they are keen to maintain control for a number of years to monetize what looks like an attractive portfolio of opportunities. We have few large blocks last time I looked which could  be persuaded by the offer of a \u2018modest\u2019 premium like 40% when the journey is really just starting. Never say never but highly unlikely IMO that an offer  for the whole will be tabled at this stage as it would probably have to be hostile and could be well defended. Much more likely is a JV on El P and Brad is probably just waiting for the PM markets to calm down a little to release the MRE on Pepas which should show very impressive economics for a relatively modest capital commitment. Perhaps the BOD have received interest on both El P and El Cedro and have been discussing the optimum outcome along with ensuring that the structure of any JV with Newmont or Agnico will not come back to bite us as is sadly seen with too much frequency these days.

Brad also says he is expecting drill results before Christmas but if not then after Christmas never mentions Feb which is a million miles away from just after christmas. Personally i think the delay in playing into our hands because by now hopefully they may have more drill results bak and getting a better idea of figures.

Brad maybe waiting for more drill results to confirm what could be in Argentina. Its been 6 weeks since drill results maybe they not come back yet but why would Brad say drill results after Christmas.  he did not say drill results in Feb or later if there was a massive back log i think he may have indicated back log in a post on X just to let everyone know.

Then the next ones should be blockbusters. Whats mad is the fact people are talking of gold pulling back massively...  As it sits comfortably above $5k... Even if it went back to $4k it wouldn't effect Pepas's forward moving plans to production. I'd guess even at $2k gold Pepas would be viable, especially for a small fry like Orosur. The share price seems to have settled around the 36p mark for now. Let see how TSX react, but i reckon by end of play we'll be either around the open price or in the blue.",

Gold silver in biggest bull run ever seen.  Ok its pulling back but its all good for me. Then we have news on multiple fronts MRE in Feb Drill results from El Pantao Maybe drill results from Pepas North new area at Pepas which Brad thinks could be more Pepas here Then in April or may infill drilling at Apta Then later in year drilling at El Cedro And who knows we may get a JV on one of these sites while gold moves towards 6,000 and possibly beyond.

Yes the price is slightly down, just like many stocks today, there may be a slight delay with the MRE but that is nothing unusual. Omi is a fantastic company with huge potential and you should take this opportunity whilst the price is a little lower to get onboard because it won't be at this level for much longer.",

The discussion re El Cedro at mins 6-10 in the November interview ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ZnaIec-jw) went over my head at the time, but now seems like a clear statement from Brad that his strategy for 2026 is to try and find a big project that will attract someone like Newmont. As he says, Pepas isn't that project, but they pursued it to get the market support to get the money for exploration, which is exactly what OMI received in the last big raise.  That's why the APTA timeline has dragged, because they no longer need that MRE to get the share price up, so it's not a priority.  El Cedro is looking like a Q2 drill target rather than Q1, what with the aeromag delays, but Brad does seem to think it could be a million-ouncer, and that's why it's getting prioritised.  El Pantano, one hopes, might fall into the same category, but I think they know less about it at the moment.",

Maybe an offer (I would only entertain a \u00a31 billion+ offer) everything is pointing to OMI ramping up into a huge success story, the big mining Co have huge piles of surplus cash, they can easily justify the investment in this climate, and make a minimum 15:1 return on their investment.

          "content": "A Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) is a technical assessment that calculates the tonnage and grade of a mineral deposit based on geological data (drilling, sampling, modeling) to determine its economic potential. It defines the size and quality of a deposit, typically categorized by confidence level (Measured, Indicated, Inferred) to guide mining projects and investment decision. Bottom line is we are after \"measured (& indicated)\" which should convert to bookable reserves as soon as feasibility studies are completed and final investment decisions are made to commence mining. Paper value assigned to each ounce gets closer to true value as the uncertainty reduces. Hoping minimum 100-200kOz  measured at >4g/t  to support current share price anything higher in the indicated and inferred is upside. Drill spacing looks close enough for measured across all of the main ore zone. GLA.",

Needs to be pulled together into a coherent story.\"  He's been stressing since drilling began that the goal was only to get a sense of the geology, rather than target the best hits.  They've rejigged how the assays are being tested, seemingly because they were seeing both gold and silver, so it seems unlikely the results are bad, and it's been confirmed that they found the sort of banding they were looking for.  The neutral case is that no one's had time to sit down and do the analysis on what the assays mean, and that's why they've not been released.  The hard bullish case is that they're already in talks about a JV or sale and the other party wants the results sat on.  That seems less likely, but either way, it's just a waiting game.",

Worked out well for the 'NFT's'... Non-Fungible Tokens??... And it's unlikely old money would let new money have control anyway. Although BTC looks like it will have a small place in the world finances.

We are only in January and there is SO much exciting newsflow to come here during the rest of the year, regardless of the macros.  There is every chance that new discoveries will be announced and we are on the verge of such at El P and North Pepas.  We also have guaranteed world class drilling results to come from APTA, which is about to be drilled to MRE. So whether the share price goes up, down, or sideways on the MRE, it will sure as hell be bouncing towards new highs on the newsflow to come in the weeks and months ahead.  Of that I am very confident.  OMI appears to have the midas touch when it comes to its projects.  Pepas is the smallest but perhaps tastiest, but the big hitters are yet to come.  Have to be here when those projects start to come home and for the biggest gains. Do not give your shares away too cheaply or prematurely.  Many have done already, and are no doubt regretting bailing out too early. 40p is a level we should all be relatively comfortable with and remain firmly sitting on those hands.  But we've told many this already and folk will do what comes most easily to them.  All good and GLA for whatever you do around the MRE!",

Orosur owns 100% of these titles and applications through two Colombian wholly owned subsidiary companies, Minera Anz\u00e1, and Minera Monte Aguila.\nThe Pepas gold deposit is located in the northern part of the Anz\u00e1 project area and was discovered by the Company's previous JV partners in early 2022, but not advanced. When the Company reassumed 100% ownership of Anz\u00e1 in November 2024, it commenced drilling immediately at Pepas with positive results, leading to the decision in June 2025 to focus drilling entirely at Pepas to allow estimation of a Mineral Resource as quickly as possible.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The Company's decision to focus its efforts on moving the Pepas deposit toward an MRE has been justified with this result. We will now immediately move Pepas into the economic study and permitting stage, while at the same time expanding our exploration effort to begin testing e other prospects within the Anz\u00e1 project.\"\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas Mineral Resource Estimate\nA Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") has been completed for the Pepas deposit by international mineral consulting firm, Bara Consulting Limited, with an effective date of\n16 January 2026\n. The MRE was prepared in accordance with the 2019 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines and 2014 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves and disclosed to National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). Details of the MRE evaluation will be provided in a Technical Report prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 filed under the Company's SEDAR profile within 45 days of this release.\nThe Pepas Mineral Resource comprises an estimated 1.14 million tonnes at a grade of 5.46 g/t gold for 201,000 ounces of gold in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 0.19 million tonnes at a grade of 2.99 g/t gold for 19,000 ounces of gold in the Inferred Mineral Resource category and assumes extraction via an open pit mining scenario. Mineral Resources are classified as Indicated and Inferred based on CIM Definition Standards.\nThe resource is entirely contained within an open pit shell, down to a vertical depth of approximately 100m, with mineralisation starting at surface. The MRE and pit shell have been generated using a gold price of US$3000/oz and a reporting cut-off grade of 0.92g/t Au.\nDeposit\nResource Category\nTonnes (Mt)\nGold Grade (g/t)\nContained Gold (ozs)\nPepas\nIndicated\n1.14\n5.46\n201,000\nPepas\nInferred\n0.19\n2.99\n18,000\nTable 1.

          "content": "Okay, a few people have asked.  So this is how I \"genuinely\" feel about things right now: 1) We have an enviable and world class exploration portfolio, with district scale potential.  We are likely sitting on millions of ounces across the portfolio. 2) But it's no good having these projects unless you have the cash (and skill/luck) to drill them and make discoveries. 3) Here, OMI has two key sources of cash.  The first is the existing kitty of \u00a313 million.  The second is this Pepas deposit - albeit a few years away yet from going into production. 4) The \u00a313 million we already have is MORE THAN sufficient for OMI to make a second and much larger scale discovery.  So we don't actually need the Pepas cash to \"make\" a second discovery and generate that upside.  That's been taken care of already with the fund raises. 5) The Pepas cash WILL, however, allow OMI to take a second discovery into production AND fund all future exploration costs across the portfolio. 6) At the point any second project goes into production, the cash generated from it will likely dwarf the cash being generated by this Pepas deposit.  Pepas will only be the flag bearer for as long as it takes to get the much larger second project into production.  The second producing project will actually be the big prize here. (An exception to this might be if we go onto discover more Pepas's, such that Pepas itself actually grows into the large scale flag bearing production project - could easily happen!) THIS is the sequence of compelling fundamentals that have caused me to have a large position in OMI and have a LTH in mind.  In order for this dream company making scenario to happen, the following needed/needs to happen: 1) Pepas is capable of generating enough cash to fund the second project.  On today's MRE, this has been FULLY accomplished.  So this is a clear \u2714. 2) Pepas is also capable of generating enough cash to fund future exploration.  On today's MRE, this has been FULLY accomplished.  So this is a clear \u2714. 3) Whilst Pepas is being prepared for production, OMI makes a second commercial discovery.  Some would argue that this is also a \u2714 based on APTA, but let's call this an X for now.   Will this second discovery be APTA, North Pepas, El P, El C or LV?  This remains to be seen! So overall how do I feel about the MRE? - whilst it's lower than the baseline 250koz I wanted, it's only short by 30koz.  This shortfall is completely irrelevant in the overall scheme of things.  Because on today's RNS, its very much MISSION ACCOMPLISHED in terms of what we needed from this initial Pepas deposit!  Which means it's GAME VERY MUCH ON AND DREAM VERY MUCH ALIVE so far as I am concerned.  Easy and big money to be made here from 25p in the coming weeks and months!  All imo and dyor",

Based on conceptual economic modeling for a shallow, high-grade open-pit operation utilizing third-party toll processing, the initial capex is estimated at around US$16 million. This would equate to roughly $67-80 per ounce of recoverable gold over the life of mine (assuming 72% extraction rate yielding ~238,000 oz from a similar-sized resource). Compared to global benchmarks, this capex intensity is exceptionally low. Typical gold development projects range from $200-500+ per ounce (e.g., large-scale operations like Barrick's Fourmile at ~$100-280/oz over reserves, or mid-tier Canadian projects at ~$250/oz annual production equivalent), with even optimized small-scale builds rarely dipping below $100/oz. Factors like Pepas' near-surface mineralization, simple metallurgy (88-90% recovery), low mining costs ($2-3.50/t), and off-site processing enable this minimal upfront spend, positioning it among the world's lowest for near-term producers. Not all mines are the same....",

As always, days like today bring out the Special Team! Nice to see Stoneo given some I-pad privileges this avo, to join the party. Today confirmed that we have a $Boz of the yellow stuff in the ground, which can be easily and quickly accessed, to allow OMI to go Elephant Hunting!  According to the TP analysis sent out earlier today, the MRE provides a NPV10% of $189m. Think how diluted we would need to become to raise that sort of cash!  I like many others on here are in this for the long haul, so blips like today do not impact me. The next few weeks will be interesting, with the right news likely to reverse and exceed anything we have seen today. This might come sooner than you think!  G",

Omi is in the best place it has ever been. Well funded and now having sprott on board. It does however pay to keep your feet on the ground.

          "content": "Back of the envelope figures. Gold Price $5k. Might be too high. AISC: $1500. Might be too low. Total oz: 220,000. (You'd expect them to find more.) Revenue: $1.1 billion. Costs: $330m. Gross Profit: $770m. Taxes, royalties etc. Assume 25%. Total net profit: $575m Exchange rate at 1.37 dollars to \u00a3. \u00a3420m. NPV to account for 10-12 years. Depends on your discount rate, but I'd guess about \u00a3180m. You'd then discount to this because the mine isn't there producing gold as expected, but is currently years away. Very subjective. Anywhere from maybe \u00a350-100m. Which isn't too far from where we are. I think the story that may get lost in all this though is that Pepas is still special. It is in scope for Omi to build it and profit from. If the company was earning \u00a340m a year there's massive scope for exploration and project development. Never say never I guess - but while Brad can chase his white whale, these will never be mined by Omi. I think even APTA is fundamentally out of scope. The upfront cost will be too high, so you'd have to sell the project to someone, potentially at a significant discount. You'd hope perhaps we are heading towards a bull market with lots of M&A, but its not guaranteed. My concern is that bringing this to production is going to be quite slow and boring. Brad has run off to Brazil and Nigeria when previously bored. In that case though he had nothing to do with Newmont and Agnico controlling things. They need to get this through permitting and then start looking for Pepas II, III, IV etc. Or we can hope to find the motherlode in Argentina and get bought out.",

Your recent ramping and cross ramping over ufo has turned out just as unreliable. You are in no position to attack posters.",

          "content": "Hi Doc - a lot will depend on exactly when those catalysts land.  Some of the relevant factors might be: 1) What is gold doing at the time the particular catalyst lands? 2) What is the general market doing? 3) What is OMI's share price doing - consolidating, retracing or already on the move up?  (FOMO, sell on news, etc) 4) Has there already been another catalyst recently delivered to the market? 5) What other catalysts or news is pending at that time? There's no doubt that a new discovery at Pepas North will be a biggie.  But I also think that getting \"Pepas style\" results at APTA will move the share price needle, especially if they land in favourable market conditions.  It goes without saying that the same applies at El Cedro (huge project).  As for El P, we will need to wait to see what they have already found, and how close they are to a major discovery there, when they will target the discovery, as well as what JV interest they get. But plenty of fantastic share price drivers here, which is what makes this a very exciting and compelling share.  If the Pepas MRE can take us and provide us with a higher floor (whether much higher or slightly higher), then it sets us up very nicely for one or more of the multiple potential catalysts that we have coming up here to then drive us up to the next level.  That's the investment case here and it's just a case of letting it play out over the coming months and quarters.  Let's hope we get off to a cracking start with the Pepas MRE.  All imo and GLA",

Once it remains at elevated levels and the market can see that high gold prices are here to stay, this should feed through once more into the sector.  OMI remains well placed and well resourced to capitalise on this upcoming environment. I think this is what BG is alluding to. It\u2019s great the MRE wasn\u2019t released into last week\u2019s volatility as it likely would have been wasted. Timing can be quite important with such announcements. So whether deliberately held back or delayed, much prefer to see it land when it will have the best possible chance of impacting well.",

Will it be one big RNS or multiple rns over this month and next and then drill results from Pepas North maybe come this month or next. Another rig will be moving to Apta where the grades there were outstanding so prity much guaranteed good results from them drill holes. Lots to look forward in this first six months for omi shareholders and then drilling will start at El Cedro.  In the mean time Brad will decide whats the next phase and when drilling will start again at El Pantano. Looks to be a mega year incoming which could see lots of shareholders very happy with the returns here.  Good luck all.",

There\u2019s no doubt that is the plan\u2026.. that is why they went after PEPAS south first. Maybe not the biggest deposit but open pit mining, high grade deposit meaning low AISC. Near roads so it can be refined nearby using toll payments with low capex and so a quicker route to production (no plant to build and commission) and so a quick route to generating cash\u2026. It\u2019s just all so very \u2026. Sensible",

OMI are already planning to toll Pepas so why not build the plant at the bigger deposit and use Pepas ore to start with whilst drilling out and preparing the deeper bigger ore site??

Broadly speaking, as a gold prospect generator, that view might hold \u2014 but let me explain, because there are several factors at work. At the point where true value is first created \u2014 the \u201cHAD005 moment\u201d, when you actually discover gold \u2014 the share price is leveraged partly to the gold price and partly to market perception and expectations. At that stage, the share price reflects value in the ground, which itself depends on multiple new variables: size and grade how big the system is location and, critically, the realistic probability of becoming an economic mine Many projects fail. Many mines fail. Above all, however, the share price reflects the market\u2019s confidence in management\u2019s ability to deliver a mine or project. That\u2019s precisely why GGP\u2019s share price fell so hard while De Grey\u2019s didn\u2019t fall as badly in 2022. Once you become a gold producer, everything changes. The key difference is that you can now leverage your balance sheet and cash flow against both operational performance and the gold price. You\u2019re no longer forced to rely on debt. You can: fund project development internally, accelerate projects , discover additional ounces, consolidate assets , acquire complementary projects In short, production gives you control \u2014 and that\u2019s where sustained value creation really begins. GGP's SP exploded once it became clear GGP management had control. A wise and called Rusty Delroy once said 8 or 9 /10ths of any junior miner or developers value /market cap is essentially the market's confidence that they will deliver. This is easily demonstrated by Solgold was recently sold for \u00a3850m whereas GGP is today worth some \u00a34.5bn and pumping out $ billions in revenue. But yet solgold had over 24moz of gold - versus GGPs 3 moz. Funny that don't you think. Serious investors (ie the market) felt Solg management were un-investable.\u201d",

Agree with your black out theory got to be big news coming which could push share price big style at some point the board with have to give us shareholders some info.  Think gold silver on way back down and silver to test 71 dollars again. May hold out a bit longer before buying a few more. My policy is to keep buying what i can afford as Im a long  term investor here, sorry to disappoint some.  Lastly did Warren Buffet build his empire by trading in and out of stocks answer no.  however if thats what floats your boat good luck.",

Also Brad said that El Cedro was too big to go alone and the size of the area was 1,5km x1,5km or 1mile by 1m well El Pantano is 12 times that length by 3 times width.  And to find all this with just 3 months worth of drilling.  If the figures are as good as they think the sp should fly like Airforce 2. Something big must be brewing so the MRE in Pepas could be small fry in comparison to what could be happening in Argentina.  The drills could be stopping in Argentina in a week or two for now. At some point we could have loads of news coming our way whether its this month or next its coming.",

We know they\u2019ve been talking of seeing similarities to Cerro Negro for a year or two. Newmont have visited El Pantano, the Orosur team have visited El Pantano. Both Newmont and Anglo both requested to see all information that comes out of El Pantano. It bodes very well for the future, Newmont will partner with us in Argentina in my opinion.

This has caused mining and processing projects worldwide to stall or fail, weakening supply chain resilience and threatening economic and security interests. The administration views this as a shared international problem that requires coordinated action among allies. To address this, the United States outlines a strategy centred on reindustrialisation, securing end-to-end supply chains and rebuilding domestic mining and processing capacity. Measures include large-scale public financing, direct investment in mining and processing projects, accelerated permitting, creation of strategic mineral stockpiles and protection of domestic producers from unfair price competition. A key proposal is the creation of a preferential critical minerals trade zone among allied countries, featuring enforceable price floors and coordinated trade measures to stabilise markets, support investment and prevent market flooding. The goal is to diversify global supply, ensure predictable pricing and strengthen partner economies while reducing dependence on concentrated or unreliable sources. Japan strongly supports these objectives, highlighting its own efforts to diversify supply, invest upstream and downstream and enhance economic security through legislation, public-private financing and international cooperation. Japan stresses that resilience can only be achieved collectively and welcomes new forums for coordination such as FORGE. U.S. officials further outline four pillars of action: investing in mining projects, stockpiling critical minerals, protecting producers from market distortions and rebuilding the mining ecosystem through regulatory reform and workforce development. The overarching message is a shift from discussion to execution, with the United States seeking broad international participation to build resilient, secure and diversified critical mineral supply chains that support long-term global prosperity and security.",

In the end the control premium was modest as the larger holders bent over. Our directors have very modest holdings in OMI ( last time I looked I had more than our Chairman and CEO combined) so I suspect they are keen to maintain control for a number of years to monetize what looks like an attractive portfolio of opportunities. We have few large blocks last time I looked which could  be persuaded by the offer of a \u2018modest\u2019 premium like 40% when the journey is really just starting. Never say never but highly unlikely IMO that an offer  for the whole will be tabled at this stage as it would probably have to be hostile and could be well defended. Much more likely is a JV on El P and Brad is probably just waiting for the PM markets to calm down a little to release the MRE on Pepas which should show very impressive economics for a relatively modest capital commitment. Perhaps the BOD have received interest on both El P and El Cedro and have been discussing the optimum outcome along with ensuring that the structure of any JV with Newmont or Agnico will not come back to bite us as is sadly seen with too much frequency these days. I expect news this week either way.",

Brad says have they found a discovery he says no but we have found a mineralisation system.  he said they are happy with what they have seen but need to find if its economic, as I said they only drilled a few holes so cant say until they have figures however they are very bullish with what they have seen to date. Brad also says he is expecting drill results before Christmas but if not then after Christmas never mentions Feb which is a million miles away from just after christmas. Personally i think the delay in playing into our hands because by now hopefully they may have more drill results bak and getting a better idea of figures.  All good in my book but until we definitely know figures its all guess work or speculation from us all.",

Even if it went back to $4k it wouldn't effect Pepas's forward moving plans to production. I'd guess even at $2k gold Pepas would be viable, especially for a small fry like Orosur.

Then we have news on multiple fronts MRE in Feb Drill results from El Pantao Maybe drill results from Pepas North new area at Pepas which Brad thinks could be more Pepas here Then in April or may infill drilling at Apta Then later in year drilling at El Cedro And who knows we may get a JV on one of these sites while gold moves towards 6,000 and possibly beyond.

Yes the price is slightly down, just like many stocks today, there may be a slight delay with the MRE but that is nothing unusual. Omi is a fantastic company with huge potential and you should take this opportunity whilst the price is a little lower to get onboard because it won't be at this level for much longer.",

The harder gold goes up the harder it falls.  Cant see 6k today Nap! We have formed the cup now its the handle all looking fantastic from where Im standing.

The discussion re El Cedro at mins 6-10 in the November interview ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ZnaIec-jw) went over my head at the time, but now seems like a clear statement from Brad that his strategy for 2026 is to try and find a big project that will attract someone like Newmont. As he says, Pepas isn't that project, but they pursued it to get the market support to get the money for exploration, which is exactly what OMI received in the last big raise.  That's why the APTA timeline has dragged, because they no longer need that MRE to get the share price up, so it's not a priority.  El Cedro is looking like a Q2 drill target rather than Q1, what with the aeromag delays, but Brad does seem to think it could be a million-ouncer, and that's why it's getting prioritised.  El Pantano, one hopes, might fall into the same category, but I think they know less about it at the moment.",

It might be time to ask ourselves what are the reasons that might cause this silence, because everything points to a news blackout, withholding drill results would mean something big is brewing. Maybe an offer (I would only entertain a \u00a31 billion+ offer) everything is pointing to OMI ramping up into a huge success story, the big mining Co have huge piles of surplus cash, they can easily justify the investment in this climate, and make a minimum 15:1 return on their investment. Next week could be momentous. GLA",

It defines the size and quality of a deposit, typically categorized by confidence level (Measured, Indicated, Inferred) to guide mining projects and investment decision. Bottom line is we are after \"measured (& indicated)\" which should convert to bookable reserves as soon as feasibility studies are completed and final investment decisions are made to commence mining. Paper value assigned to each ounce gets closer to true value as the uncertainty reduces. Hoping minimum 100-200kOz  measured at >4g/t  to support current share price anything higher in the indicated and inferred is upside.

Needs to be pulled together into a coherent story.\"  He's been stressing since drilling began that the goal was only to get a sense of the geology, rather than target the best hits.  They've rejigged how the assays are being tested, seemingly because they were seeing both gold and silver, so it seems unlikely the results are bad, and it's been confirmed that they found the sort of banding they were looking for.  The neutral case is that no one's had time to sit down and do the analysis on what the assays mean, and that's why they've not been released.  The hard bullish case is that they're already in talks about a JV or sale and the other party wants the results sat on.  That seems less likely, but either way, it's just a waiting game.",

Worked out well for the 'NFT's'... Non-Fungible Tokens??... And it's unlikely old money would let new money have control anyway.

We are only in January and there is SO much exciting newsflow to come here during the rest of the year, regardless of the macros.  There is every chance that new discoveries will be announced and we are on the verge of such at El P and North Pepas.  We also have guaranteed world class drilling results to come from APTA, which is about to be drilled to MRE. So whether the share price goes up, down, or sideways on the MRE, it will sure as hell be bouncing towards new highs on the newsflow to come in the weeks and months ahead.  Of that I am very confident.  OMI appears to have the midas touch when it comes to its projects.  Pepas is the smallest but perhaps tastiest, but the big hitters are yet to come.  Have to be here when those projects start to come home and for the biggest gains. Do not give your shares away too cheaply or prematurely.  Many have done already, and are no doubt regretting bailing out too early. 40p is a level we should all be relatively comfortable with and remain firmly sitting on those hands.  But we've told many this already and folk will do what comes most easily to them.  All good and GLA for whatever you do around the MRE!",

If the \u00a313m cash is going on drilling and wages, where do you think this capex will come from? I assume they can't forward sell gold that isn't out the ground yet, so will they require another raise? Take on some debt? What do you think? Appreciate your thoughts again ID78. In other words, what are the upfront costs of production, and how would that be funded?",

This is part of the game, and part of their game plan.  Or in some cases, they just like to wind up for the fun of it. Similarly, you can't help the obvious rampers who shoot for the moon at every positive tick on the chart or piece of news.  If you are on the bb long enough, you are able to identify for yourself who falls into what category.  Who you think has credibility and is worth listening to, whether they are bullish or bearish.  Who are the trolls, mischief makers and fudsters.  Can't do much about them though other than to filter, not engage and/or warn others. Being a LTH on AIM is a real gruel at times.

Brad obviously came out fighting this morning on X, which is nice to see, however I believe his language may have contributed to some further drift today. i.e. Pepas \"should become clearer in a month or two\",  \"Anza in a week or two once we get the logistics sorted\",\" Drilling at El Pantano should end in a few weeks\" (which suggests we will get nothing till all the drilling is done/analysed)., \"aero mag starting at El Cedro and APTA as soon as the crew finishes their work for our neighbours Royal Road.\" - Given BG's records of not sticking to forecast time scales, I am wondering  a lot of day  trader types who may have hung about for the bounce, thought - nothing going on here for at least a couple of months,  I will take my cash elsewhere for the time being. .If this is indeed the case and we hear nothing for several weeks, I am scared we may drift further. As I said yesterday I am a LTH so a month or two here or there does affect me in the long run, but to have lost 3 'paper' bags in the last week, the thought of further drift is very frustrating. Think we should ban BG from making timescale/MRE predictions! :-)",

The rest is speculative exploration Argentina (El Pantano) Columbia, PEPAS North, Apta and El Cedro (and erm the new one I\u2019ve forgotten)\u2026 APTA has potential as a large, high-grade body of gold mineralisation and has already got tens of thousands of metres of drilling and can be proven up to a resource soonish. El Cedro - a possible large gold porphyry target They are funded for all drilling this year, 2 drills in Columbia and one in Argentina. Next year we would be wanting PEPAS south to fund all drilling. \u2026 the MRE stated about 40,000oz. At $5,000/oz that is $2mill a year. More than the current MCAP. Don Durrett had this as a potential 50 bagger if all these targets come in good. That is the quick investment case. PEPAS south we know has $1bill gold. That\u2019s is fact. There is huge potential for upside at the other target areas PEPAS south was the smallest but could be proven up. and be brought into production quickly, to fund further exploration and minimise dilution.",

I've been a holder for about 5 months with an average value 23.5p. Today, I'm teetering into the red. For many, the market reaction to the MRE has been incredibly distressing. Just weeks ago I was sitting on a 60% increase, for me, that's huge. For some it's nothing. I don't care about how many 'bags' someone has or doesn't have. To me, it matters. I am not a mining expert, but I understand the broad case for investing in gold miners given the broader geopolitical position. So could someone please factually restate the case for OMI over the next 12 months? Strip out the purposeful negativity, told-you-so-ism, strip out the rockets - both takes have been proven as silly as each other over the 9 months I've tracked OMI and 5 I've held. I intend on holding for at least 12-18 months more. Over that time period, what is the feasible, material investment case for this company that makes it a better place to put my hard earned cash than elsewhere? What are the risks? If this board has the expertise I've noticed often claimed by both the optimists and pessimists, a balanced answer shouldn't be impossible. Thanks.",

There was a big picture uptrend that has been in place since the end of 2024. The 120day Moving Average is currently sitting about 23ish.  We recently had enthusiastic support and growth that took us up to 40, but this RNS has seen us drop back here. You can argue all you like about the rights and wrongs, but here we are.  So what does this tell us??  A lot of what pushed us to 40 would be traders, and those looking for quick money, and much of that will have gone. We have those who are spooked, those who will simply trade their money elsewhere and we have derampers.  We have now fallen below Long Term 120MA uptrend and thats not great. There will be plenty out there who want to push this down further.   Regardless of your outlook on the company, the SP is still very vulnerable and further falls possible.  Where would support be .. 18p ?? Its impossible to call the bottom here .. good luck and well done if you do.",

Not so much the ramping overblown expectation of posters that have relentlessly been hyping up expectations. It is not 230 k oz. It is 201 k oz  with 18 k lower grade in the lowest category of confidence that will not be accepted in any feasibility so 201 k oz.

Would the share price be double what it was before today? And it wasn't a guess, it was more hope. And the ramping here that you speak of, 400 ounces. How many times have you said that whatever is posted on a BB carries no weight in the  markets? Have you now changed your tune? And 220K is 27% less than what BG hoped for. But he also said something like 4 g/t. So 25% under the actual grade. You're posting, for postings sake. I don't believe you hold, and that you post to antagonise.",

          "content": "Okay, a few people have asked.  So this is how I \"genuinely\" feel about things right now: 1) We have an enviable and world class exploration portfolio, with district scale potential.  We are likely sitting on millions of ounces across the portfolio. 2) But it's no good having these projects unless you have the cash (and skill/luck) to drill them and make discoveries. 3) Here, OMI has two key sources of cash.  The first is the existing kitty of \u00a313 million.  The second is this Pepas deposit - albeit a few years away yet from going into production. 4) The \u00a313 million we already have is MORE THAN sufficient for OMI to make a second and much larger scale discovery.  So we don't actually need the Pepas cash to \"make\" a second discovery and generate that upside.  That's been taken care of already with the fund raises. 5) The Pepas cash WILL, however, allow OMI to take a second discovery into production AND fund all future exploration costs across the portfolio. 6) At the point any second project goes into production, the cash generated from it will likely dwarf the cash being generated by this Pepas deposit.  Pepas will only be the flag bearer for as long as it takes to get the much larger second project into production.  The second producing project will actually be the big prize here. (An exception to this might be if we go onto discover more Pepas's, such that Pepas itself actually grows into the large scale flag bearing production project - could easily happen!) THIS is the sequence of compelling fundamentals that have caused me to have a large position in OMI and have a LTH in mind.  In order for this dream company making scenario to happen, the following needed/needs to happen: 1) Pepas is capable of generating enough cash to fund the second project.  On today's MRE, this has been FULLY accomplished.  So this is a clear \u2714. 2) Pepas is also capable of generating enough cash to fund future exploration.  On today's MRE, this has been FULLY accomplished.  So this is a clear \u2714. 3) Whilst Pepas is being prepared for production, OMI makes a second commercial discovery.  Some would argue that this is also a \u2714 based on APTA, but let's call this an X for now.   Will this second discovery be APTA, North Pepas, El P, El C or LV?  This remains to be seen! So overall how do I feel about the MRE? - whilst it's lower than the baseline 250koz I wanted, it's only short by 30koz.  This shortfall is completely irrelevant in the overall scheme of things.  Because on today's RNS, its very much MISSION ACCOMPLISHED in terms of what we needed from this initial Pepas deposit!  Which means it's GAME VERY MUCH ON AND DREAM VERY MUCH ALIVE so far as I am concerned.  Easy and big money to be made here from 25p in the coming weeks and months!  All imo and dyor",

          "content": "Orosur Mining's (OMI) Pepas prospect at the Anz\u00e1 project has a maiden mineral resource estimate of approximately 219,000 ounces (201,000 oz indicated at 5.46 g/t Au and 18,000 oz inferred at 2.99 g/t Au). Based on conceptual economic modeling for a shallow, high-grade open-pit operation utilizing third-party toll processing, the initial capex is estimated at around US$16 million. This would equate to roughly $67-80 per ounce of recoverable gold over the life of mine (assuming 72% extraction rate yielding ~238,000 oz from a similar-sized resource). Compared to global benchmarks, this capex intensity is exceptionally low. Typical gold development projects range from $200-500+ per ounce (e.g., large-scale operations like Barrick's Fourmile at ~$100-280/oz over reserves, or mid-tier Canadian projects at ~$250/oz annual production equivalent), with even optimized small-scale builds rarely dipping below $100/oz. Factors like Pepas' near-surface mineralization, simple metallurgy (88-90% recovery), low mining costs ($2-3.50/t), and off-site processing enable this minimal upfront spend, positioning it among the world's lowest for near-term producers. Not all mines are the same....",

Costs: $330m. Gross Profit: $770m. Taxes, royalties etc. Assume 25%. Total net profit: $575m Exchange rate at 1.37 dollars to \u00a3. \u00a3420m. NPV to account for 10-12 years. Depends on your discount rate, but I'd guess about \u00a3180m. You'd then discount to this because the mine isn't there producing gold as expected, but is currently years away. Very subjective. Anywhere from maybe \u00a350-100m. Which isn't too far from where we are. I think the story that may get lost in all this though is that Pepas is still special. It is in scope for Omi to build it and profit from. If the company was earning \u00a340m a year there's massive scope for exploration and project development. Never say never I guess - but while Brad can chase his white whale, these will never be mined by Omi. I think even APTA is fundamentally out of scope. The upfront cost will be too high, so you'd have to sell the project to someone, potentially at a significant discount. You'd hope perhaps we are heading towards a bull market with lots of M&A, but its not guaranteed. My concern is that bringing this to production is going to be quite slow and boring. Brad has run off to Brazil and Nigeria when previously bored. In that case though he had nothing to do with Newmont and Agnico controlling things. They need to get this through permitting and then start looking for Pepas II, III, IV etc. Or we can hope to find the motherlode in Argentina and get bought out.",

          "content": "Hi Doc - a lot will depend on exactly when those catalysts land.  Some of the relevant factors might be: 1) What is gold doing at the time the particular catalyst lands? 2) What is the general market doing? 3) What is OMI's share price doing - consolidating, retracing or already on the move up?  (FOMO, sell on news, etc) 4) Has there already been another catalyst recently delivered to the market? 5) What other catalysts or news is pending at that time? There's no doubt that a new discovery at Pepas North will be a biggie.  But I also think that getting \"Pepas style\" results at APTA will move the share price needle, especially if they land in favourable market conditions.  It goes without saying that the same applies at El Cedro (huge project).  As for El P, we will need to wait to see what they have already found, and how close they are to a major discovery there, when they will target the discovery, as well as what JV interest they get. But plenty of fantastic share price drivers here, which is what makes this a very exciting and compelling share.  If the Pepas MRE can take us and provide us with a higher floor (whether much higher or slightly higher), then it sets us up very nicely for one or more of the multiple potential catalysts that we have coming up here to then drive us up to the next level.  That's the investment case here and it's just a case of letting it play out over the coming months and quarters.  Let's hope we get off to a cracking start with the Pepas MRE.  All imo and GLA",

It\u2019s great the MRE wasn\u2019t released into last week\u2019s volatility as it likely would have been wasted. Timing can be quite important with such announcements.

Another rig will be moving to Apta where the grades there were outstanding so prity much guaranteed good results from them drill holes. Lots to look forward in this first six months for omi shareholders and then drilling will start at El Cedro.  In the mean time Brad will decide whats the next phase and when drilling will start again at El Pantano. Looks to be a mega year incoming which could see lots of shareholders very happy with the returns here.  Good luck all.",

There\u2019s no doubt that is the plan\u2026.. that is why they went after PEPAS south first. Maybe not the biggest deposit but open pit mining, high grade deposit meaning low AISC. Near roads so it can be refined nearby using toll payments with low capex and so a quicker route to production (no plant to build and commission) and so a quick route to generating cash\u2026.

High-grade (from surface), low-tonnage potential that should \u2014 all going well \u2014 return multiples of the current market cap. This will probably take 2\u20133 years to come to fruition and start delivering those returns. It's a great long-term investment case in my opinion. I think the institutional investors agree. It's often stated that \"where there is gold, there is more\"\u2026 and as Brad has said, \"we've only just scratched the surface\u2026 we haven't even begun to look deep.\" Initially, I invested here because of Pepas and the potential for another deposit of this type. I haven't lost any optimism about the prospect of finding Pepas North \u2014 in fact, I've only grown more confident. So remember: regardless of the distractions caused by short-term price fluctuations (whether in the metals market or OMI's share price) and the emotions they may trigger for investors watching the hourly/daily/weekly charts, our deposits have been forming over millions of years\u2026 and just like me, they aren't going anywhere.",

          "content": "This applies to OMI I think. \u201cNot exactly. Broadly speaking, as a gold prospect generator, that view might hold \u2014 but let me explain, because there are several factors at work. At the point where true value is first created \u2014 the \u201cHAD005 moment\u201d, when you actually discover gold \u2014 the share price is leveraged partly to the gold price and partly to market perception and expectations. At that stage, the share price reflects value in the ground, which itself depends on multiple new variables: size and grade how big the system is location and, critically, the realistic probability of becoming an economic mine Many projects fail. Many mines fail. Above all, however, the share price reflects the market\u2019s confidence in management\u2019s ability to deliver a mine or project. That\u2019s precisely why GGP\u2019s share price fell so hard while De Grey\u2019s didn\u2019t fall as badly in 2022. Once you become a gold producer, everything changes. The key difference is that you can now leverage your balance sheet and cash flow against both operational performance and the gold price. You\u2019re no longer forced to rely on debt. You can: fund project development internally, accelerate projects , discover additional ounces, consolidate assets , acquire complementary projects In short, production gives you control \u2014 and that\u2019s where sustained value creation really begins. GGP's SP exploded once it became clear GGP management had control. A wise and called Rusty Delroy once said 8 or 9 /10ths of any junior miner or developers value /market cap is essentially the market's confidence that they will deliver. This is easily demonstrated by Solgold was recently sold for \u00a3850m whereas GGP is today worth some \u00a34.5bn and pumping out $ billions in revenue. But yet solgold had over 24moz of gold - versus GGPs 3 moz. Funny that don't you think. Serious investors (ie the market) felt Solg management were un-investable.\u201d",

Also Brad said that El Cedro was too big to go alone and the size of the area was 1,5km x1,5km or 1mile by 1m well El Pantano is 12 times that length by 3 times width.  And to find all this with just 3 months worth of drilling.  If the figures are as good as they think the sp should fly like Airforce 2. Something big must be brewing so the MRE in Pepas could be small fry in comparison to what could be happening in Argentina.  The drills could be stopping in Argentina in a week or two for now. At some point we could have loads of news coming our way whether its this month or next its coming.",

Talk is cheap as you say but for Brad and Louie to both prefer El Pantano over Anza with what we\u2019ve seen and for them to believe they\u2019ve already stumbled upon a substantial mineral system then\u2026. We know they\u2019ve been talking of seeing similarities to Cerro Negro for a year or two. Newmont have visited El Pantano, the Orosur team have visited El Pantano. Both Newmont and Anglo both requested to see all information that comes out of El Pantano. It bodes very well for the future, Newmont will partner with us in Argentina in my opinion. To be fair it isn\u2019t even a side dish to Anza. Yet.",

This has caused mining and processing projects worldwide to stall or fail, weakening supply chain resilience and threatening economic and security interests. The administration views this as a shared international problem that requires coordinated action among allies. To address this, the United States outlines a strategy centred on reindustrialisation, securing end-to-end supply chains and rebuilding domestic mining and processing capacity. Measures include large-scale public financing, direct investment in mining and processing projects, accelerated permitting, creation of strategic mineral stockpiles and protection of domestic producers from unfair price competition. A key proposal is the creation of a preferential critical minerals trade zone among allied countries, featuring enforceable price floors and coordinated trade measures to stabilise markets, support investment and prevent market flooding. The goal is to diversify global supply, ensure predictable pricing and strengthen partner economies while reducing dependence on concentrated or unreliable sources. Japan strongly supports these objectives, highlighting its own efforts to diversify supply, invest upstream and downstream and enhance economic security through legislation, public-private financing and international cooperation. Japan stresses that resilience can only be achieved collectively and welcomes new forums for coordination such as FORGE. U.S. officials further outline four pillars of action: investing in mining projects, stockpiling critical minerals, protecting producers from market distortions and rebuilding the mining ecosystem through regulatory reform and workforce development. The overarching message is a shift from discussion to execution, with the United States seeking broad international participation to build resilient, secure and diversified critical mineral supply chains that support long-term global prosperity and security.",

The Company has now moved into the Phase 2 of the JV, that will see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional US$2m, a large part of which will be spent on a 3,000 metre drill program which commenced at El Pantano in November and is expected to conclude in early 2026. First holes from the El Pantano drilling program confirm a low sulphidation epithermal mineral system. Whilst assays are still awaited, the Company is confident that it has achieved its general objective of proving the existence of a substantial mineral system.",

In the end the control premium was modest as the larger holders bent over. Our directors have very modest holdings in OMI ( last time I looked I had more than our Chairman and CEO combined) so I suspect they are keen to maintain control for a number of years to monetize what looks like an attractive portfolio of opportunities. We have few large blocks last time I looked which could  be persuaded by the offer of a \u2018modest\u2019 premium like 40% when the journey is really just starting. Never say never but highly unlikely IMO that an offer  for the whole will be tabled at this stage as it would probably have to be hostile and could be well defended. Much more likely is a JV on El P and Brad is probably just waiting for the PM markets to calm down a little to release the MRE on Pepas which should show very impressive economics for a relatively modest capital commitment. Perhaps the BOD have received interest on both El P and El Cedro and have been discussing the optimum outcome along with ensuring that the structure of any JV with Newmont or Agnico will not come back to bite us as is sadly seen with too much frequency these days.

Brad also says he is expecting drill results before Christmas but if not then after Christmas never mentions Feb which is a million miles away from just after christmas. Personally i think the delay in playing into our hands because by now hopefully they may have more drill results bak and getting a better idea of figures.  All good in my book but until we definitely know figures its all guess work or speculation from us all.",

Brad maybe waiting for more drill results to confirm what could be in Argentina. Its been 6 weeks since drill results maybe they not come back yet but why would Brad say drill results after Christmas.  he did not say drill results in Feb or later if there was a massive back log i think he may have indicated back log in a post on X just to let everyone know.  We ll find out sooner or later but my guess its in Feb 2026 keeping my options open.",

Then we have news on multiple fronts MRE in Feb Drill results from El Pantao Maybe drill results from Pepas North new area at Pepas which Brad thinks could be more Pepas here Then in April or may infill drilling at Apta Then later in year drilling at El Cedro And who knows we may get a JV on one of these sites while gold moves towards 6,000 and possibly beyond. Apologies if Im being a bit negative here.",

Yes the price is slightly down, just like many stocks today, there may be a slight delay with the MRE but that is nothing unusual. Omi is a fantastic company with huge potential and you should take this opportunity whilst the price is a little lower to get onboard because it won't be at this level for much longer.",

The discussion re El Cedro at mins 6-10 in the November interview ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ZnaIec-jw) went over my head at the time, but now seems like a clear statement from Brad that his strategy for 2026 is to try and find a big project that will attract someone like Newmont. As he says, Pepas isn't that project, but they pursued it to get the market support to get the money for exploration, which is exactly what OMI received in the last big raise.  That's why the APTA timeline has dragged, because they no longer need that MRE to get the share price up, so it's not a priority.  El Cedro is looking like a Q2 drill target rather than Q1, what with the aeromag delays, but Brad does seem to think it could be a million-ouncer, and that's why it's getting prioritised.  El Pantano, one hopes, might fall into the same category, but I think they know less about it at the moment.",

Needs to be pulled together into a coherent story.\"  He's been stressing since drilling began that the goal was only to get a sense of the geology, rather than target the best hits.  They've rejigged how the assays are being tested, seemingly because they were seeing both gold and silver, so it seems unlikely the results are bad, and it's been confirmed that they found the sort of banding they were looking for.  The neutral case is that no one's had time to sit down and do the analysis on what the assays mean, and that's why they've not been released.  The hard bullish case is that they're already in talks about a JV or sale and the other party wants the results sat on.  That seems less likely, but either way, it's just a waiting game.",

Worked out well for the 'NFT's'... Non-Fungible Tokens??... And it's unlikely old money would let new money have control anyway. Although BTC looks like it will have a small place in the world finances. You won't find any hackers being able to steal your physical gold, especially those sweating behind a computer screen in their mums basement. No tin foil hat here. Mine's a hat made of pure gold.

We are only in January and there is SO much exciting newsflow to come here during the rest of the year, regardless of the macros.  There is every chance that new discoveries will be announced and we are on the verge of such at El P and North Pepas.  We also have guaranteed world class drilling results to come from APTA, which is about to be drilled to MRE. So whether the share price goes up, down, or sideways on the MRE, it will sure as hell be bouncing towards new highs on the newsflow to come in the weeks and months ahead.  Of that I am very confident.  OMI appears to have the midas touch when it comes to its projects.  Pepas is the smallest but perhaps tastiest, but the big hitters are yet to come.  Have to be here when those projects start to come home and for the biggest gains. Do not give your shares away too cheaply or prematurely.  Many have done already, and are no doubt regretting bailing out too early. 40p is a level we should all be relatively comfortable with and remain firmly sitting on those hands.  But we've told many this already and folk will do what comes most easily to them.  All good and GLA for whatever you do around the MRE!",
