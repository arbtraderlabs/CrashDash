As anticipated, drilling\nresults have firmed up the Pepas deposit and provided better definition of the nature of the thick, high-grade mineralisation. Recent results are largely as expected in terms of the grade distribution across Pepas.\nThe MRE at Pepas is anticipated to be delivered by the end of January 2026.\nAt El Cedro, some 10kms to the south of Pepas but on the same licence, the Company completed a large-scale soil geochemical survey covering most of what is thought to be a large scale porphyry system. Soil samples were taken at roughly 25m intervals, along ridges and spurs for ease of access and to ensure soils were residual. The survey showed gold assay results identifying a substantial, gold bearing system, with highly anomalous geochemical responses over a large, well preserved zoned porphyry system, with soil samples assays at times exceeding 1g/t Au.\nIn addition, analysis of\nnew geochemical data, in conjunction with historical mapping information and airborne geophysical data collected in 2012 has identified a second porphyry system to the south of El Cedro within the same structural regional corridor.\n\u00b7\nIn Argentina\n,\nthe Company has earned a direct 51% interest in the Argentine company, Deseado Dorado S.A.S (\"Deseado\"), that owns the exploration licences that make up the El Pantano Project in Santa Cruz province. The Company has now moved into the Phase 2 of the JV, that will see it move to 100% ownership of Deseado upon investment of an additional\u00a0US$2m, a large part of which will be spent on a 3,000 metre drill program which commenced at El Pantano in November and is expected to conclude in early 2026.\nFirst holes from\u00a0the El Pantano\u00a0drilling program confirm a low sulphidation epithermal mineral system. Whilst assays are still awaited, the Company is confident that it has achieved its general objective of proving the existence of a substantial mineral system.\n\u00b7\nIn Nigeria\n,\u00a0in view of the Company's need to prioritise the use of its capital and human resources, a decision was taken to withdraw from the lithium project which will be formalized over the next few weeks. The investment in Nigeria was fully impaired in the Company's financial statements as at May 31, 2025 and it remains fully impaired.\nFinancial and Corporate\n\u00b7\nOn November 30, 2025, the Company had a cash balance of US$16,280,000 (May 31, 2025 US$4,877,000). As at the date of this MD&A and including the funds raised in the private placement (detailed below), the Company had a cash balance of US$14,920,000.\n\u00b7\nO\nn September 18, 2025 the Company announced an upsized brokered private placement (the \"Placing\") to raise gross proceeds of up to CAD$20 million through the issue of up to 58,823,530 common shares at a price of CAD$0.34 per common share. The Placing, which was over- subscribed, was completed on October 2 2025 and raised CAD$20 million. No warrants were issued in connection with the Placing.\n\u00b7\nPost the period end, at the Company's AGM held on December 17, 2025\nall resolutions put to shareholders were duly passed.\n\u00b7\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost method except for certain financial assets and liabilities which are accounted for as Assets and Liabilities held for sale (at the lower of book value or fair value) and Profit and Loss from discontinuing operations. This accounting treatment has been applied to the activities in Uruguay and Chile.\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars)\nUnaudited\nAs at\nNovember 30, 2025\n$\nAs at\nMay 31,\n2025\n$\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash\n16,280\n4,877\nRestricted cash\n12\n12\nAccounts receivable and other assets\n656\n434\nAssets held for sale in Uruguay\n10\n20\nTotal current assets\n16,958\n5,343\nNon-current assets\nProperty and equipment\n300\n288\nExploration and evaluation assets\n6,335\n3,858\nTotal assets\n23,593\n9,489\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n820\n623\nWarrant liability\n3,578\n1,706\nLiability of Uruguay discontinued operation\n486\n529\nTotal current liabilities\n4,884\n12,858\nTotal liabilities\n4,884\n2,858\nEquity\nShare capital\n90,721\n74,675\nShare-based payments reserve\n11,192\n10,931\nWarrants\n36\n436\nCurrency translation reserve\n(1,445)\n(2,159)\nAccumulated deficit\n(81,801)\n(77,258)\nTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent\n18,703\n6,625\nNon-controlling interest\n6\n6\nTotal equity\n18,709\n6,631\nTotal liabilities and equity\n23,593\n9,489\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss)\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars)\n(Except common shares and per share amounts)\nUnaudited\nSix Months Ended\nNovember 30, 2025\n$\nSix Months Ended\nNovember 30, 2024\n$\nCorporate and administrative expenses\n(995)\n(913)\nExploration expenses\n(132)\n(109)\nShare-based compensation\n(706)\n(107)\nOther income\n8\n51\nNet finance cost\n(17)\n(6)\nLoss on fair value of warrants\n(2,532)\n-\nForeign exchange (loss) gain\n(185)\n18\nNet loss for the period for continuing operations\n(4,559)\n(1,066)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations\n16\n2,936\nNet income (loss) for the period\n(4,543)\n1,870\nItem which may be subsequently reclassified to income (loss):\nCumulative translation adjustment\n714\n(680)\nTotal comprehensive income (loss) for the period\n(3,829)\n1,190\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per share for\n- continuing operations\n(0.01)\n(0.00)\n- discontinued operations\n0.00\n0.01\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\n339,688,019\n215,596,429\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(Expressed in thousands of United States dollars)\nUnaudited\nSix Months Ended\nNovember 30, 2025\n$\nSix Months Ended\nNovember 30, 2024\n$\nOperating activities\nNet (loss) income for the period for continued and discontinued operations\n(4,543)\n1,870\nAdjustments for\nDepreciation\n10\n10\nShare-based payments\n706\n107\nReversed liability and interest accrued\n-\n(2,376)\nLoss on fair value of warrants\n2,532\nForeign exchange and other\n53\n(11)\nChanges in non-cash working capital items:\nAccounts receivable and other assets\n(223)\n(69)\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n132\n(628)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(1,333)\n(1,097)\nInvesting activities\nPurchase of property and equipment\n(22)\n-\nExploration and evaluation expenditures\n(1,793)\n(268)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(1,815)\n(268)\nFinancing activities\nProceeds from issue of common shares, net of shares issuance cost\n13,137\n952\nProceeds from exercise of options\n286\n-\nProceeds from exercise of warrants\n1,778\n-\nWarrant liability exercised\n(660)\n-\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n14,541\n952\nNet change in cash\n11,393\n(413)\nNet change in cash classified within assets held for sale\n10\n30\nCash, beginning of period\n4,877\n1,328\nCash end of period\n16,280\n945\nOperating activities\n- continuing operations\n(1,304)\n1,309\n- discontinued operations\n(29)\n(2,406)\nInvesting activities\n- continuing operations\n(1,815)\n(268)\nFinancing activities\n- continuing operations\n14,522\n952\n- discontinued operations\n19\n-\nFor further information, visit\nwww.orosur.ca\n, follow on X @orosurm or please contact:\nOrosur Mining Inc\nLouis Castro, Chairman,\nBrad George, CEO\ninfo@orosur.ca\nTel:\n+1 (778) 373-0100\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP - Nomad & Joint Broker\nJeff Keating / Jen Clarke / Devik Mehta\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd\n-\nJoint Broker\nAndy Thacker/Guy McDougallTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nFlagstaff Communications and Investor Communications\nTim Thompson\nAllison AllfreyMark Edwards\norosur@flagstaffcomms.com\nTel: +44 (0)207 129 1474\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 ('MAR') which has been incorporated into UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The latter of these was acquired by Orosur in November 2024 from the Company's previous JV partners, Newmont Mining and Agnico Eagle Mines. Orosur thus owns 100% of the Anz\u00e1 Project.\nSince acquiring 100% control, the Company has focussed its attention on three prospects:\n\u00b7\nPepas - a shallow, high-grade body of gold mineralisation that the Company is endeavouring to move to an initial Mineral Resource Estimate in the near term.\n\u00b7\nAPTA - a high-grade body of gold mineralisation that has to date seen 38,000m of drilling, but is not yet sufficiently understood geologically to allow a MRE to be calculated. The Company plans to undertake additional drilling at APTA in 2026, with the objective of advancing it toward an MRE.\n\u00b7\nEl Cedro - a large gold porphyry system in the south of the Project area. The Company has completed a large soil sampling program and plans to undertake a maiden drill program here in early 2026.\nFigure 1. Anz\u00e1 Project\nPepas Drilling\nAs announced on 14th July 2025, the Company had taken the formal decision to commence infill drilling at its Pepas gold prospect at Anz\u00e1, with the objective of moving Pepas to a NI43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") as quickly as possible.\nThis infill drill program was completed late in December 2025, with results from the final three holes PEP072, PEP073 and PEP074 just received.\nAs expected, gold assay results from these three holes were exceptional, demonstrating the core of Pepas to contain very thick, high-grade zones of gold mineralisation.\nHole\u00a0Number\nFrom\u00a0(m)\nTo\u00a0(m)\nInterval (m)\nAu (g/t)\nPEP072B\n0\n47.6\n47.6\n3.43\nincluding\n16.25\n19.7\n3.45\n6.52\nPEP073\n0\n104.45\n104.45\n5.96\nincluding\n25.45\n59.6\n34.15\n10.3\nPEP074\n0\n71.35\n71.35\n6.46\nincluding\n11.4\n26.5\n15.1\n23.59\nTable 1. Latest drill Intercepts, Pepas Prospect\nFigure 2. Plan of holes\nFigure 3. Section, PEP072\nFigure 3. Section, PEP073, PEP074\nWith the receipt of these results, the gold assay database has been closed off and handed to our resource consultants so that work on the MRE modelling process can commence.\nFeasibility\nThe Company has begun the process of assessing the economic exploitation options for Pepas in the context of the Colombian permitting regime. Discussions are currently underway with local technical consultants to map out the permitting framework, necessary environmental and social studies, and development of the required technical work plan (Programa de Trabajo y Obras - PTO), that could commence once an MRE is finalised.\nWider Exploration\nFollowing the Christmas break and retirement of the old drill rig for much needed repairs, a new rig has arrived on site to commence a regional drill program north of Pepas. This program is reconnaissance in nature, designed to better understand the wider litho-structural environment that controls the Pepas mineralisation.\nAs has been previously announced, plans for drilling programs to the south at APTA and El Cedro will be progressed once airborne geophysical surveys have been undertaken over these prospects. Options for this work are being assessed.\nGranting of mining exploration licences (\"Titles\")\nThe Company is constantly assessing its land package in Colombia in terms of geological potential, costs to hold, the ability of exploration work to be undertaken and any subsequent discovery exploited in light of local community sentiment.\nTo that end, several major adjustments were made at the end of December 2025.\nTwo of the larger, longer held applications, that made up the bulk of the original Anz\u00e1 JV project, have now been granted, and converted to exploration licences (Figure 1). The Company thus now has three large contiguous granted Titles, totalling 173km2, all within the mining friendly Anz\u00e1 municipality, an increase of some 65%.\nReconnaissance surface work has previously been undertaken on these new licences by the Company's previous JV partners. These data will now be re-assessed and exploration plans developed accordingly now that drilling is able to be undertaken.\nIn addition, several smaller applications have been dropped for various reasons, including geological prospectivity, or likely inability to able to be explored as they fall outside Anz\u00e1 municipality in less receptive areas.\nThe Company thus currently now has 154km2 under application.\nOrosur CEO Brad George commented:\n\"The Company starts 2026 in a very different position to a year ago.
