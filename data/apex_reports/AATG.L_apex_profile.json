The Boards stated that they would, subject to agreement in principle to implement the Mergers by all six Boards, put proposals to their respective shareholders so as to be able to implement these Mergers. Agreement in principle has now been reached.\nThe Companies have today issued a joint circular (\"Circular\") setting out proposals for, amongst other things, the Mergers, alongside a prospectus being published by AAEV, AATG and CRWN (\"Prospectus\") in respect of proposed offers for subscription (\"Offers\" and each an \"Offer\"). The Circular includes notices of general meetings of the Companies to be convened on 11 December 2024 and 19 December 2024 (\"General Meetings\"\u00a0and each a\u00a0\"General Meeting\").\nIf Shareholders approve these Mergers and the Mergers proceed, AADV will be merged into AAEV, KAY will be merged into AATG and AAVC will be merged into CRWN (AAEV, AATG and CRWN being the \u201cAcquirer VCTs\u201d and AADV, KAY and AAVC being the \u201cTarget VCTs\u201d). The Mergers will be effected pursuant to schemes of reconstruction under section 110 of IA 1986 whereby the assets and liabilities of the relevant Target VCT will be transferred to its relevant Acquirer VCT in exchange for new Shares in that Acquirer VCT which will be issued to the Target VCT's Shareholders (\u201cSchemes\u201d). A merger on this basis will be outside the provisions of the Takeover Code. In the case of the AAEV/AADV Scheme and the AATG/KAY Scheme the number of new Shares to be issued in that Acquirer VCT (\u201cConsideration Shares\u201d) will be calculated by reference to the respective net asset values of that Acquirer VCT and the relevant Target VCT, so as to avoid any dilution to either Acquirer or Target VCT Shareholders. In the case of the CRWN/AAVC Scheme, it is proposed that AAVC Shareholders will be issued a new class of shares in CRWN (\"New CRWN Shares\"), which will encompass the existing AAVC portfolio (with one New CRWN Share being issued for each AAVC Share that an AAVC Shareholder holds). This new share class will then convert into CRWN Shares in accordance with the New CRWN Articles by reference to the respective net asset values of the CRWN Share class and the New CRWN Share class as at 30 June 2026. It is expected that conversion of the New CRWN Shares will complete in November 2026. Given that CRWN has greater exposure to the more mature technology investments within the Albion portfolio, the purpose of the different approach in the case of the CRWN/AAVC Scheme is to allow the maturity profile of both portfolios to converge before the conversion is effected. The Merger of each of AAEV and AADV, AATG and KAY and CRWN and AAVC are not conditional on any of the other Mergers proceeding.\nFull details of the Mergers are set out in the Circular available for download from each Company's website referred to below and the National Storage Mechanism at\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\n.\nBenefits of the Merger\nThe Mergers are expected to bring a number of benefits for Shareholders, as follows:\nAggregate annual cost savings of approximately \u00a31.5 million (\u00a3746,000 in respect of AAEV/AADV, \u00a3443,000 in respect of AATG/KAY and \u00a3315,000 in respect of CRWN/AAVC). Of this saving, \u00a3452,000 relates to a reduction in the management and administration fees payable to Albion Capital.Simplicity for Shareholders, many of whom are invested across more than one of the six Albion VCTs.A payback period of between 15 to 24 months based on the estimated Merger costs and annual cost savings post-Merger.The Mergers should result in a more stable and resilient base for providing long-term returns to Shareholders.Both Albion Capital and the Boards believe the amalgamation of the Companies' portfolios and operations will result in more efficient management and administration processes, which in turn should increase Albion Capital's ability to focus on investment and portfolio management.The Enlarged Acquirer VCTs shoul"
