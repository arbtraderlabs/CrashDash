These early bird discounts were available to investors who subscribed for Offer Shares for the first \u00a310m across the three Albion VCTs participating in the Offers. The cost of these discounts is being borne by the Manager of the Albion VCTs, Albion Capital Group LLP. The issue pricing of the Offer Shares has been structured to avoid any capital dilution to existing shareholders who do not participate in the Offers.\nThe Company has received valid applications for 3,570,012 Offer Shares which were allotted at an issue price of 70.41 pence per share from existing shareholders and for 670,420 Offer Shares which were allotted at an issue price of 70.77 pence per share for new subscribers, all of which qualified for the early bird discount. A further 14,955,120 Offer Shares were allotted at an issue price of 71.14 pence per share (which did not qualify for the early bird discount). The total net proceeds receivable by the Company for these allotments is approximately \u00a313.2 million.\nApplication has been made to the Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\") for 19,195,552 Offer Shares to be admitted to the Official List and to the London Stock Exchange for those Offer Shares to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's market for listed securities. The Offer Shares rank pari passu with the existing shares in issue.\nIt is expected that admission to the Official List will become effective and that dealings in the Offer Shares will commence on or around 22 December 2025.\nAs at 19 December 2025, the total amount raised across the Albion VCTs under the Offers is \u00a344 million. The Offers are expected to close no later than 5.30 p.m. on 2 April 2026 (unless fully subscribed by an earlier date or previously closed).\nFollowing this allotment and in conformity with the provisions of the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (the \"DTRs\"), the Company makes the following notifications in connection with the issued share capital of the Company:\nThe Company's capital as at 19 December 2025 consists of 427,887,766 ordinary shares of 1 pence each (of which the Company holds 32,370,947 ordinary shares in treasury).\nTherefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is 395,516,819, which may be used by shareholders and other persons as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the DTRs.\nFor further information, please contact:\nVikash HansraniOperations PartnerAlbion Capital Group LLPCompany Secretary 020 7601 185019 December 2025",
