Revenue for the continuing Group decreased by 13% to $131.4 million. Consistent with full-year guidance, this was primarily driven by softer demand in the UK, the impact of tariffs and competitive pricing pressure in Europe. Despite this, the Group remained profitable, with adjusted operating profit of $5.7 million and a continued focus on sustainable growth. Cash generation and working capital management improved year-on-year, and the Group ended the period with net cash of $1.9 million. Strong orderbook visibility at 96% entering the second half underpins confidence in meeting full-year expectations, with the business well positioned for margin and profit recovery over the medium term.\nDivestment of DG Americas and discontinued operations\nThe Group completed the sale of DG Americas to Hilco on 30 May 2025. Hilco is conducting a realisation of the DG Americas group entities through asset sales and liquidations, with any future net proceeds to the Group contingent on completion of this process. As at 30 September 2025 the fair value measured as expected cash flows from future proceeds was estimated at $nil.\nA loss on the sale of the DG Americas division of $140.3 million has been recognised which, when coupled with $10.1 million of DG Americas trading losses in the period, results in a loss from discontinued operations of $150.4 million.\nComparative information for the prior periods has been represented to reflect the classification of DG Americas as a discontinued operation, consistent with the current period's presentation. Cash flows attributable to discontinued operations are disclosed separately within the cash flow. Refer to note 1 for additional information.\nBoard changes\nPaul Bal stepped down from his role as CEO, following the successful disposal of DG Americas, with Stewart Gilliland assuming the role of Interim Executive Chair. The CEO recruitment process remains underway. Stewart Gilliland remains committed to the role of Interim Executive Chair until an appointment has been finalised.\nMark Tentori, Senior Independent Director and Audit Committee Chair, stepped down from the Board following the AGM in line with governance best practice, as he has been a member of the Board for over nine years. The Board would like to thank Mark for his commitment to the Group over his tenure. John Gittins, who joined the Board in March 2025, has been appointed as Audit Committee Chair and Clare Askem has taken over as Senior Independent Director.\nOutlook and strategy\nThe Board reaffirms the expectation that full-year revenues are in line with the previously guided range of $270-280 million. Entering the second half, the Group benefits from strong orderbook visibility at 96% (HY2025: 88%), providing confidence that full-year performance will remain aligned with guidance.\nThe Group also remains confident that full year adjusted operating margins will be maintained within the guided range of 3-4%.\nFollowing the divestment of DG Americas, the Group is simpler with segments that have a strong heritage and benefit from well-established and stable relationships with the major retailers. These businesses offer structured, design-led product ranges supported by an extensive global footprint. Together, these foundations provide resilience and a strong platform for future growth.\nThe Group is focused on delivering sustainable growth in revenue, margins and cash generation across the UK, continental Europe and Australia. This growth over the coming years will be delivered by focusing on the following long-term drivers: premiumisation, product diversification, customer and channel expansion, and the strengthening of commercial capability. Premiumisation through product enhancement and a more disciplined approach to pricing is expected to reinforce the value proposition and drive sustained margin improvement. Alongside this, diversifying and broadening the portfolio, particularly into higher-margin and under-served categories, will reduce concentration risk and create new, more profitable revenue streams. Expanding customer reach and accessing new channels, will increase distribution and improve operational leverage across the Group. In parallel, strengthening commercial and marketing capabilities will support more consistent execution and scalable growth in line with ambitions. In addition, a disciplined approach to reducing costs, particularly central overheads, will further improve Group margins.\nAs these initiatives progress, the Group expects to deliver sustained revenue growth, margin improvement and better cost efficiency, enabling consistent cash generation and the creation of long-term value for shareholders.\nCapital allocation remains focused on supporting organic growth opportunities, complemented by selective investment in strategic opportunities. Following the sale of DG Americas, the Company currently does not have sufficient distributable reserves to pay a dividend. However, the Group maintains a strong balance sheet and cash position, and a project is underway to create sufficient reserves. The Board expects to provide a further update on this process as and when appropriate. The Board remains fully committed to reinstating shareholder distributions as soon as it is appropriate to do so and will continue to review this in line with the Group's performance, cash position and strategic priorities.\nRegional highlights\nThe continuing Group comprises three reporting segments: DG UK, DG Europe and DG Australia, along with central costs and eliminations. The Group's product categories fall into two key themes: Celebrate and Create. As a leading manufacturer and distributor of celebration products, our ranges help millions of people celebrate life's special moments each year. The Celebrate category is made up of gift packaging (such as giftwrap, greetings cards and gift bags), party products and goods not for resale. The Group's Create products spark imagination, foster creativity, and encourage learning, to help consumers of all ages express themselves and build new skills. This category includes stationery, homeware and craft product categories.\nAcross the Group, there are a combination of well-structured product ranges with a strong focus on design and innovation, supported by a geographically diverse market footprint that spans 70 countries.\nSegmental Revenue\nAdjusted Operating Profit\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n% Group revenue\nHY2026\nHY2025\nChange\nHY2026\nHY2025\nChange\nHY2026\nHY2025\n$m\n$m\n%\n$m\n$m\n%\n%\n%\n45%\nDG Europe\n58.8\n59.0\n-\n7.5\n8.7\n(14)\n12.7%\n14.7%\n38%\nDG UK\n50.3\n71.9\n(30)\n0.7\n7.2\n(90)\n1.5%\n10.0%\n17%\nDG Australia\n22.8\n21.1\n8\n1.7\n1.1\n54\n7.6%\n5.4%\n-\nCentral & Eliminations\n(0.5)\n(0.7)\n(4.2)\n(4.1)\n100%\nTotal\n131.4\n151.3\n(13)\n5.7\n12.9\n(56)\n4.3%\n8.6%\nDG Europe\nDG Europe designs, manufactures and sources across the Celebrate and Create categories. It comprises a manufacturing business in the Netherlands and Poland, primarily serving giftwrap within the Celebrate category and a trading business based in the Netherlands focusing on homeware products within the Create category. The segment's main customers are large value and mass-market retailers.\nRevenue for the period was $58.8 million (HY2025: $59.0 million), broadly in line with the prior year. Performance reflects a pricing decline as a result of the competitive European market, and a timing shift of customer orders into the second half versus the prior year, which offset growth from existing customers in new product categories.\nAdjusted operating profit was $7.5 million (HY2025: $8.7 million), with margins of 12.7% (HY2025: 14.7%). The decline in margin was driven by the pricing investment to maintain competitiveness and market share with value and mass retailers. There was a further impact from the timing shift which offsets freight cost tailwinds from the normalisation of rates from last year's elevated levels.\nDG Europe accounts for 45% of Group revenue, with the second half supported by a strong orderbook covering 99% of full year forecast sales. Looking ahead, the segment is focused on capturing growth opportunities through the expansion of products and customers, while continuing to drive operational efficiency. The clear visibility entering the second half, coupled with this focus on opportunities, provides a solid platform for sustained delivery of full-year results.\nDG UK\nDG UK designs and manufactures around two-thirds of its products across the Celebrate and Create categories, with the majority of sales in Celebrate. UK operations in Wales and Newport Pagnell are supported by a Group sourcing office in China.\nDG UK revenue for the period was $50.3 million (HY2025: $71.9 million), a 30% decrease compared with the prior period. The reduction in sales reflects a combination of softer demand, particularly in the Independents channel, the impact of US tariffs, and a timing element where Christmas orders are being shipped later than prior year. DG UK's largest customer is predominantly US-based, and the introduction of US tariffs resulted in the customer reducing volumes in anticipation of lower consumer demand amid macroeconomic uncertainty. In addition, to mitigate the decline in trading, temporary pricing support was agreed with this customer to help offset the tariff impact. Whilst there were pockets of growth with new business wins among national retailers, this was not sufficient to offset the overall decline.\nAs a result, adjusted operating profit for the period declined to $0.7 million (HY2025: $7.2 million), with the adjusted operating margin falling to 1.5% (HY2025: 10.0%). This performance was partially mitigated by cost savings from the prior year closure of the Huizhou site and continued progress in cost control and action to reduce overheads.\nDuring the period, DG UK completed several operational initiatives aimed at strengthening efficiency and cost base. The successful closure of the Huizhou factory has delivered a leaner cost base and improved sourcing flexibility, reducing the Group's fixed overhead exposure. The re-establishment of a Group sourcing team following the sale of DG Americas allows for coordination with Far East suppliers and supports supply-chain assurance. These actions demonstrate the focus and progress in simplifying the UK operating model, improving cost discipline, and mitigating supply-chain risks. With these foundations in place, DG UK (representing 38% of Group revenue) enters the second half well positioned, supported by strong visibility on full-year sales. The orderbook stands at 87%, in line with the prior year. The robust orderbook, the shift of seasonal shipments into the second half, and a higher-margin sales mix, gives the Board confidence around full-year forecast delivery.\nDG Australia\nDG Australia operates a warehouse facility and sources all of its products, with no in-country manufacturing. The business is focused predominantly on the Celebrate category, offering a wide range of Everyday products including partyware, cards, and giftwrap. Key sales channels include independent retailers and national retail chains, supported by an extensive SKU portfolio.\nDG Australia makes up 17% of Group revenue. Revenue for the period was $22.8 million (HY2025: $21.1 million), an 8% increase year-on-year, reflecting growth across both national and independent channels, particularly within the party products range. Adjusted operating profit increased to $1.7 million (HY2025: $1.1 million), with the margin improving to 7.6% (HY2025: 5.4%) driven by higher sales volumes and an improved margin mix.\nDuring the period, the Australian warehouse relocation was successfully completed following the expiry of the previous lease. The transition was managed effectively, with any short-term disruption recovered through the commitment and hard work of the local team. While the impact in the period was limited, elevated costs are expected from the new and improved facility going forward, reflecting current market rental costs. Despite higher operational costs of this facility, it will support the strategic focus of DG Australia to drive sales growth which will maximise the utilisation of the fixed overhead base. While the market remains competitive, the segment's continually refreshed product portfolio and innovative yet disciplined approach to new product development, position the business for steady progress over the medium term.\nDetailed Financial Review\nThe Group's financial results for continuing operations for the first six months of the year are summarised below. The prior year has been represented on a like-for-like basis for the continuing Group.\nHY2026\nHY2025\nReported\nAdjusting Items\nAdjusted\nReported\nAdjusting Items\nAdjusted\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\nRevenue\n131.4\n-\n131.4\n151.3\n-\n151.3\nGross profit\n25.3\n1.0\n26.3\n35.4\n0.8\n36.2\nGross margin\n19.2%\n20.0%\n23.4%\n23.9%\nOverheads\n(21.0)\n0.4\n(20.6)\n(26.8)\n3.5\n(23.3)\nOperating profit\n4.3\n1.4\n5.7\n8.6\n4.3\n12.9\nOperating margin\n3.3%\n4.3%\n5.7%\n8.6%\nFinance charge\n(0.6)\n0.2\n(0.4)\n(0.6)\n-\n(0.6)\nProfit before tax\n3.7\n1.6\n5.3\n8.0\n4.3\n12.3\nTax\n0.3\n(0.4)\n(0.1)\n(2.2)\n-\n(2.2)\nProfit after tax\n4.0\n1.2\n5.2\n5.8\n4.3\n10.1\nOperating profit\n4.3\n1.4\n5.7\n8.6\n4.3\n12.9\nDepreciation and impairment\n2.5\n-\n2.5\n3.3\n(0.8)\n2.5\nDepreciation of right of use assets\n2.6\n(0.5)\n2.1\n2.4\n-\n2.3\nEBITDA\n9.4\n0.9\n10.3\n14.3\n3.5\n17.9\nDiluted earnings per share\n4.1c\n0.8c\n4.9c\n5.7c\n4.5c\n10.2c\nRevenue from continuing operations decreased by 13% to $131.4 million (HY2025: $151.3 million). The reduction reflects the market headwinds previously communicated, including softer demand in the UK, the impact of tariffs on UK sales into the US and competitive pricing pressure across Europe. In addition, approximately $7 million of expected revenue shifted into the second half of the year due to timing of shipments, primarily within Europe.\nWhen assessed on a constant currency basis, Group revenue decreased by approximately 16%, with a modest positive impact from foreign exchange translation on the reported USD result.\nAdjusted gross profit was $26.3 million (HY2025: $36.2 million), with the adjusted gross margin declining to 20.0% (HY2025: 23.9%). The movement primarily reflects competitive pricing, the impact of tariffs and the resultant impact on operating leverage from lower production volumes.\nAdjusted overheads reduced to $20.6 million (HY2025: $23.3 million), reflecting the benefits of the prior year restructuring actions and continued cost discipline across the Group.\nConsequently, adjusted operating profit for the period was $5.7 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 4.3% (HY2025: $12.9 million, 8.6%), driven by the lower gross profit, partially offset by overhead savings.\nThe Group recorded an adjusted net finance charge of $0.4 million (HY2025: $0.6 million). The net finance charge is made up of financing income of $0.5 million (HY2025: $0.6 million) and $0.9 million of interest costs including lease liability interest (HY2025: $1.2 million). The financing cost improved reflecting reduced borrowing costs, despite lower cash levels throughout the reporting period.\nAdjusted profit before tax was $5.3 million (HY2025: $12.3 million), consistent with the reduction in operating profit.\nAdjusting items before tax of $1.6 million (HY2025: $4.3 million) are comprised primarily of costs relating to the relocation of DG Australia's warehouse operations with transition-related expenses and temporary dual-site running costs.\nAdjusted profit after tax was $5.2 million (HY2025: $10.1 million), with the tax credit in HY2026 primarily reflecting the release of a tax provision. Reported profit after tax for the period was $4.0 million (HY2025: $5.8 million).\nTaxation\nThe taxation credit for the half year on profit before tax is $0.3 million (HY2025: $2.2 million charge) with the effective tax rate at (8.0)% (HY2025: 27.0%). The tax charge on adjusted profit before tax is $0.1 million (HY2025: $2.2 million) with the effective tax rate at 2.4% (HY2025: 17.6%). The effective tax rate in the UK is currently 0% as deferred tax is not recognised; the closure of Huizhou during the year resulted in a release of previously held tax provisions and is the largest contributor to the low adjusted effective rate in the period. The key driver behind the difference between adjusted and reported tax rates is the tax relief received on adjusting items.\nEPS\nDiluted adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations at 4.9 cents (HY2025: 10.2 cents) is reduced year-on-year driven by the decline in profit after tax for the period. Diluted reported earnings per share at 4.1 cents (HY2025: 5.7 cents) is lower than adjusted diluted earnings per share reflecting the adjusting items charge in the period. Further details are set out in note 9.\nCash flow and net cash\nThe Group ended the period with a net cash balance of $1.9 million (HY2025: $7.4 million), representing a year-on-year decrease of $5.5 million, due to a lower cash position at the beginning of the year. Total cash outflow in the period for the continuing Group improved by 16% year-on-year to $47.9 million (HY2025: $57.0 million), despite the revenue shift into the second half, which reflects progress and discipline in cash and working capital management.\nA summary of the Group cash flow is shown below.\nHY2026\n$m\nHY2025\n$m\nAdjusted EBITDA\n10.3\n17.9\nAdd back share-based payment charge\n0.7\n0.6\nMovements in working capital\n(51.2)\n(65.1)\nAdjusted cash used by operations\n(40.2)\n(46.6)\nAdjusting items\n(1.5)\n(3.3)\nCash used by operations\n(41.7)\n(49.9)\nCapital expenditure (net of disposals of property, plant and equipment)\n(2.4)\n(1.8)\nTax paid\n(2.4)\n(3.1)\nInterest received/(paid)\n0.4\n(0.8)\nLease liabilities principal repayments\n(2.7)\n(2.0)\nDividends paid (including those paid to non-controlling interests)\n-\n(0.7)\nFX and other\n0.9\n1.3\nMovement in net cash from continuing operations\n(47.9)\n(57.0)\nDG Americas cash outflow\n(33.3)\n(30.8)\nDG Americas disposal costs\n(1.7)\n-\nMovement in net cash\n(82.9)\n(87.8)\nOpening net cash\n84.8\n95.2\nClosing net cash\n1.9\n7.4\nWorking capital\nIt is usual for working capital levels of the Group to increase steadily in the first half of the year as the manufacturing of seasonal product builds ahead of distribution. The second half of the year sees the inflow of cash following the shipment and collection of Christmas-related receivables. In the period there was a working capital absorption of $51.2 million (HY2025: $65.1 million). This improvement was primarily in Europe, despite the delay in shipments, due to a normalised outflow versus prior year and focus on working capital management.\nCapital expenditure\nCapital expenditure of $2.4 million (HY2025: $1.8 million) increased in the period mainly due to investment in the new warehouse facility for the DG Australia operations.\nDG Americas cash outflow\nTotal cash outflow for the period relating to DG Americas includes $22.7 million of DG Americas cash outflow in the period to 30 May 2025, $10.6 million of cash balance on disposal, and $1.7 million of disposal costs. See note 5 for further details.\nBanking facilities\nOn 11 July 2025, the Group entered into a new Receivables Finance Facility with HSBC and NatWest. The facility has an initial minimum period of 36 months and provides maximum \u00a340 million funding based on a borrowing base linked to eligible receivables across a participating Group companies. Availability under the facility is determined by reference to the value of receivables, subject to eligibility criteria and concentration limits. The facility does not include financial ratio covenants but is subject to certain operational covenants. Further details are set out in note 8.\nForeign exchange exposure management\nThe Group's foreign exchange (FX) exposure is split into two areas:\nTranslational FX exposure\n- The Group's reporting currency is US dollars and the translation exposure is the result of the requirement for the Group to report its results in one currency. This necessitates the translation of our regional business units' local currency financial results into the Group's adopted reported currency. To aid comparability between periods, constant currency figures are provided by retranslating the prior year's results using current year exchange rates. In HY2026, currency movements had a favourable impact. On a constant currency basis, the revenue decline would have been $5.8 million higher, and the decline in adjusted profit before tax would have been $0.5 million greater, had HY2025 results been translated at HY2026 rates.\nTransactional FX exposure\n- The FX exposure is managed carefully by the Group by adopting an active hedging policy to ensure that the foreign exchange movements remain mitigated as far as possible. In addition, a reasonable proportion of hedging is achieved through natural hedges whereby our purchases and sales in US dollars are offset within the Group. The balance of our hedging is achieved through the forward exchange contracts and similar derivatives.\nThe Group intends to adopt GBP as its presentation currency for consolidated financial statements, replacing USD, effective from the FY2026 full-year results. This follows a strategic review of the Group's reporting approach in light of its evolving structure and the disposal of DG Americas, which has materially reduced USD-denominated revenues and profits.\nFinancial position and going concern basis\nThe Group's net assets decreased by $131.2 million since the end of the financial year to $138.9 million at 30 September 2025, driven by the sale of DG Americas. The Directors have continued to pay close attention to their assessment of going concern in preparation of these financial statements. The Group is appropriately capitalised at the year end with a net cash position of $1.9 million and availability of committed borrowing facility.\nThe Directors of the Group have performed an assessment of the overall position and future forecasts for the purposes of going concern. The going concern assessment has been performed using the Group's FY2026 and FY2027 forecasts. A reduction in cash flow volatility following the disposal of the DG Americas business is expected, with the remaining Group forecasted to deliver more stable profitability and cash generation, reflecting continued progress towards a more consistent and resilient financial performance. The forecasts, reviewed by the Board, also incorporate the inherent seasonality of the Group's operations. The forecasts were sensitised to reflect severe but plausible adverse downturns in the current assumptions including the potential impact of the loss of a significant portion of the business with one of our major customers, a recurrence of previous freight rate inflation and a cyber-attack, beyond those risks already factored into the budgets and plans.\nThe base forecasts and additional sensitivity analysis have been tested against the availability of the borrowing facility. The analysis demonstrated that the Group has sufficient headroom to meet its obligations as they fall due for the forecast period of more than twelve months beyond the date of signing these accounts. As such, the Directors do not see any practical regulatory or legal restrictions which would limit their ability to fund the different regions of the business as required as the Group has sufficient resources.\nAccordingly, the Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the interim financial statements.\nRisk\nThe Group operates a decentralised model where risk management is embedded within strategic and operational decision making. The principal risks and uncertainties remain consistent with those disclosed on pages 52 to 57 of our annual report and financial statements 2025. The key risks continue to be macroeconomic uncertainty and strategy. The broader macroeconomic environment is a key risk which impacts the entire business spanning suppliers, customers, consumers and the workforce. Following the sale of DG Americas the Group strategy remains vital to forge the Group's pathway to growth. The Board continues to monitor these factors closely and remains confident that the Group's risk management and control framework remains appropriate and effective, and that the business is well placed to manage the external challenges facing its markets. No new material risks have been identified since the year-end.\nStatement of Directors' responsibilities\nThe Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge that these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information, namely:\n\u00b7\nan indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n\u00b7\nmaterial related-party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related-party transactions described in the last annual report.\nBy order of the Board\nRohan Cummings\nDirector\n2 December 2025\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME

Accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe results for the six months ended 30 September 2024 and the twelve months ended 31 March 2025 have been represented to reflect that the results of DG Americas are now reported as discontinued operations and are therefore reported separately or excluded where required. See note 5 'Discontinued operations' for more information.\nThe condensed financial information contained in this interim report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 435 of the Companies Act\u00a02006 and is unaudited. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 July 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. These interim financial statements are unaudited.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 September 2025 has been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. The interim report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2025, which has been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and any public announcements made by IG Design Group plc during the interim reporting period.\nThe preparation of financial statements that conform with adopted UK IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if relevant.\nThe Group has applied the temporary exception under the Amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules' and has not recognised or disclosed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in the UK and became effective on 1 January 2024. The Group continues to assess the impact of these rules, but they are not expected to have a material effect on the Group's financial position or results.\nFor the purposes of these financial statements, 'Design Group' or 'the Group' means IG Design Group plc ('the Company') and its subsidiaries. IG Design plc is a company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the UK. Its registered office is Howard House, Howard Way, Interchange Park, Newport Pagnell, MK16 9PX. Its shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).\nSeasonality of the business\nThe business of the Group is seasonal and although revenues generally accrue relatively evenly in both halves of the year, working capital requirements, including inventory levels, increase steadily in the first half from July and peak in October as manufacturing of Christmas products builds ahead of distribution. The second half of the year sees the borrowing of the Group decline and move to typically a cash positive position as the Group collects the majority of its receivables through January to March.\nPresentation currency\nThe presentation and functional currency of the Group is US dollars. The functional currency of the Parent Company remains as pound sterling as it is located in the United Kingdom and substantially all of its cash flows, assets and liabilities are denominated in pound sterling, as well as its share capital.\nGoing concern\nInformation regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the detailed financial review above. Cash balances and borrowings and detailed information about the borrowing facilities are detailed in notes 7 and 8.\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue trading for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this report. This expectation is based on the Directors' assessment of the Group's current financial position and future cash flow forecasts over the going concern period. The assessment also considers the structure of the Group's current borrowing facilities. In forming this view, the Directors have also considered the Group's liquidity headroom, its ability to adapt to changes in market conditions, and its capacity to manage principal business risks over the forecast period.\nOn 11 July 2025, the Group entered into a new Receivables Finance facility with HSBC and NatWest, replacing its previous Asset Backed Lending (ABL) arrangement. The new facility is a minimum three-year agreement and provides funding capacity based on the level of eligible receivables across participating Group companies. The facility is subject to certain operational covenants but not financial covenants.\nIn connection with the implementation of this new facility, the Group's \u00a315.0 million overdraft facility was cancelled.\nThe Directors have reviewed detailed forecasts through to 31 March 2027. These indicate a reduction in cash flow volatility following the disposal of the DG Americas division, with the remaining Group expected to deliver more stable profitability and cash generation, reflecting continued progress towards more consistent and resilient financial performance. The forecasts also incorporate the inherent seasonality of the Group's operations.\nThese forecasts have been sensitised to reflect severe but plausible adverse scenarios. Specifically, the scenarios considered the following risks:\n\u00b7\na potential loss of significant trading with a major customer, modelled as a reduction in sales, with associated impacts on cash flow, facility availability, and working capital;\n\u00b7\na sustained period of inflation in freight rates, resulting in additional costs and related cash outflows;\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence of a cyber security incident during peak trading periods, modelled as a temporary reduction in receivables, affecting both liquidity and availability under the Group's receivables-based facility; and\nPlease refer to 2025 Annual Report for further details.\nIndividually and in aggregate, these severe but plausible scenarios do not change the conclusion that the Group has sufficient liquidity and resources to continue as a going concern. Based on this assessment, the Directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nDiscontinued operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Discontinued operations are presented separately from continuing operations in the consolidated income statement as a single amount comprising the post-tax results of the discontinued operation and the post-tax gain or loss recognised on its disposal.\nThe assets and liabilities of a disposal group when classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet.\nComparative information for the prior period has been represented, where relevant, to reflect the classification of the disposed business as a discontinued operation, consistent with the current period presentation.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim report are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period and the adoption of new and amended standards. A number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\n2. Segmental information\nThe Group has one material business activity, being the design, manufacture and distribution of various celebration and creative products.\nFollowing the disposal of DG Americas, the Group has introduced new reporting segments, and previously disclosed segments have been re-presented to reflect the current structure.\nThe Group operates under three reporting segments, which are reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Makers. These segments are:\n\u00b7\nDG UK:\nIncludes operations in Wales, Newport Pagnell, and the Group's sourcing offices in Asia.\n\u00b7\nDG Europe\n: Comprises operations in the Netherlands and Poland.\n\u00b7\nDG Australia\n: Represents the Group's joint venture in Australia.\nIn addition,\nCentral and Eliminations\ncover Group head office activities and consolidation adjustments.\nInter\n\u2011\nsegment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.\nFinancial performance of each segment is measured on adjusted operating profit before management recharges. Interest and tax are managed on a Group basis and not split between reportable segments. However, the related financial liabilities and cash have been allocated out into the reportable segments as this is how they are managed by the Group.\nSegment assets are all non-current and current assets. Inter\n\u2011\nsegment receivables and payables are not included within segmental assets and liabilities as they eliminate on consolidation.\nDG\nDG\nDG\nCentral &\nEurope\nUK\nAustralia\neliminations\nGroup\nSix months ended 30 September 2025\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nRevenue - external\n58,839\n49,802\n22,756\n-\n131,397\n- inter-segment\n-\n511\n-\n(511)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n58,839\n50,313\n22,756\n(511)\n131,397\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n7,446\n736\n1,739\n(4,253)\n5,668\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n-\n(247)\n(1,125)\n-\n(1,372)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n7,446\n489\n614\n(4,253)\n4,296\nFinance income\n515\nFinance costs\n(1,157)\nIncome tax\n292\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(150,352)\nLoss for the six months ended 30 September 2025\n(146,406)\nBalances at 30 September 2025\nSegment assets\n104,689\n97,098\n45,592\n2,186\n249,565\nSegment liabilities\n(28,093)\n(52,958)\n(28,446)\n(1,121)\n(110,618)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n534\n614\n619\n1\n1,768\n- intangible assets\n-\n476\n-\n-\n476\n- right-of-use assets\n731\n162\n94\n-\n987\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n953\n1,318\n194\n6\n2,471\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n8\n4\n16\n-\n28\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n638\n759\n1,213\n-\n2,610\nLoss on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n-\n(1)\n(54)\n-\n(55)\nDG\nDG\nDG\nCentral &\nEurope\nUK\nAustralia\neliminations\nGroup\nSix months ended 30 September 2024\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nRevenue - external\n59,011\n71,199\n21,093\n-\n151,303\n- inter-segment\n-\n749\n-\n(749)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n59,011\n71,948\n21,093\n(749)\n151,303\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n8,664\n7,167\n1,129\n(4,010)\n12,950\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n-\n(4,341)\n-\n-\n(4,341)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n8,664\n2,826\n1,129\n(4,010)\n8,609\nFinance income\n605\nFinance costs\n(1,182)\nIncome tax\n(2,166)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(1,498)\nProfit for the six months ended 30 September 2024\n4,368\nBalances at 30 September 2024\nSegment assets\n106,263\n112,542\n28,617\n27,655\n275,077\nSegment liabilities\n(60,068)\n(68,118)\n(10,609)\n(2,687)\n(141,482)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n229\n1,604\n21\n5\n1,859\n- intangible assets\n-\n6\n-\n-\n6\n- right-of-use assets\n34\n165\n92\n-\n291\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n863\n1,474\n133\n13\n2,483\nImpairment - property, plant and equipment\n-\n784\n-\n-\n784\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n7\n16\n17\n-\n40\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n598\n1,221\n593\n4\n2,416\nProfit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n11\n(6)\n7\n-\n12\nDG\nDG\nDG\nCentral &\nEurope\nUK\nAustralia\neliminations\nGroup\nYear ended 31 March 2025\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nRevenue - external\n129,683\n119,435\n40,603\n-\n289,721\n- inter-segment\n75\n824\n-\n(899)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n129,758\n120,259\n40,603\n(899)\n289,721\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n18,583\n7,439\n2,158\n(7,153)\n21,027\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n-\n(6,621)\n(687)\n-\n(7,308)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n18,583\n818\n1,471\n(7,153)\n13,719\nFinance income\n1,519\nFinance costs\n(3,173)\nIncome tax\n(5,904)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(105,436)\nLoss for the year ended 31 March 2025\n(99,275)\nBalances at 31 March 2025\nSegment assets\n79,902\n87,071\n38,430\n70,121\n275,524\nSegment liabilities\n(27,705)\n(51,594)\n(22,579)\n(45,006)\n(146,884)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n721\n2,296\n812\n15\n3,844\n- intangible assets\n46\n581\n-\n-\n627\n- right-of-use assets\n220\n749\n16,687\n-\n17,656\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n1,726\n2,770\n273\n26\n4,795\nImpairment - property, plant and equipment\n-\n765\n-\n-\n765\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n21\n25\n34\n-\n80\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n1,197\n2,222\n1,561\n8\n4,988\nProfit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n11\n(66)\n23\n-\n(32)\n3.

These\u00a0items are material items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which represent gains or losses and are presented to allow for the review of the performance of the business in a consistent manner and in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis and allow the reader to obtain a clearer understanding of the underlying results of the ongoing Group's operations. They are typically gains or costs associated with events that are not considered to form part of the core operations or are considered to be a 'non-recurring' event (although they may span several accounting periods).\nDG Australia finalised the relocation of its warehousing operations from a long-standing leased facility to a newly secured site. Relocation costs in the reporting period totalled $1.3 million (FY2025: $0.9 million) and included $1.0 million of lease-related and other expenses for the new warehouse, $0.3 million of which were classified as other finance expenses (FY2025: $0.2 million). During the transition, the business incurred double-running costs, as it remained contractually committed to the previous site while establishing full operational capability at the new location. These costs have been treated as adjusting items due to their non-recurring nature and direct link to the relocation.\nAdministrative expenses of $0.3 million relate to the final costs associated with the closure of the China site and the reorganisation of the UK business' sourcing office in the Far East (HY2025: $4.3 million, FY2025: $6.6 million).\nThe cash flow effect of adjusting items from continuing operations\nThere was a $1.5 million net outflow in the current period's cash flow (HY2025: $3.3 million, FY2025: $4.8 million) relating to adjusting items from continuing operations.\n4.

The 2025-2028 LTIP scheme is subject to certain performance criteria being achieved during a three-year period: relative Total Shareholder Return versus FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) constituents; and EPS growth, with an 'underpin' condition to reduce vesting levels if unwarranted 'windfall gains' from share price movements arise. There is a two-year holding period for one individual.\n5. Discontinued operations\nOn 30 May 2025, the Group completed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Design Group Americas, Inc., the holding company of the Group's US division (DG Americas), to HUK 168 Limited, a special purpose vehicle owned by the Hilco Capital group (the 'buyer').\nUnder the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Company received a nominal upfront payment of $1 and may be entitled to 75% of any future net proceeds realised by the buyer from a sale or realisation of DG Americas or its assets, after agreed deductions and to the extent such proceeds are not retained for DG Americas working capital purposes. As at 30 September 2025, and as the buyer progresses with the sale and realisation of the DG Americas assets, the fair value measured as the expected cash flows from the future proceeds was estimated at $nil.\nA loss on sale of DG Americas of $140.3 million was recognised in the consolidated income statement in the current year.\nUnaudited\nsix months\nended\n30 Sep 2025\n$000\nConsideration received\n-\nFair value of contingent consideration\n-\nTotal consideration\n-\nCarrying amount of net assets sold\n(131,210)\nCost to sell\n(2,092)\nLoss on sale before tax and reclassification of translation reserve\n(133,302)\nReclassification of translation reserve\n(6,948)\nIncome tax on sale\n-\nLoss on sale after income tax\n(140,250)\nThe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of disposal on 30 May 2025 were as follows:\nUnaudited\nsix months\nended\n30 Sep 2025\n$000\nNon-current assets\n63,719\nInventory\n116,900\nTrade and other receivables\n42,634\nCash and cash equivalents\n10,624\nIncome tax receivable\n1,868\nTotal assets\n235,745\nTrade and other payables\n(67,688)\nLease liabilities\n(31,211)\nIncome tax payable\n(5,636)\nTotal liabilities\n(104,535)\nNet assets of the disposal group\n131,210\nIn accordance with IFRS 5.32, management has determined that the disposal of DG Americas represents the disposal of a separate major geographical area.

The income tax expense is recognised based on management's estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. The estimated adjusted average annual tax rate used for the period to 30 September 2025 on continuing operations was 2.4% (HY2025: 17.6%). The changes in profit mix across the various territories between H1/H2 as well as non-recognition of taxes in the UK and US are the main drivers that impact the effective tax rate. The tax effect of adjusting items are recognised in the same period as the relevant adjusting item. The deferred tax assets in the UK continue not to be recognised based on the assessment of future taxable profits against which the asset could unwind.\n7.

At 30 September 2024, $2.0 million was drawn down under the Asset Backed Lending (ABL) facility.\nOn 11 July 2025, the Group entered into a new Receivables Finance Facility with HSBC and NatWest. The facility has an initial minimum period of 36 months and provides maximum \u00a340 million funding based on a borrowing base linked to eligible receivables across participating Group companies. Availability under the facility is determined by reference to the value of receivables, subject to eligibility criteria and concentration limits. The facility does not include financial ratio covenants but is subject to certain operational covenants.\nThe Receivables Finance Facility is secured over eligible receivables assigned by participating Group companies. The facility is supported by specific security arrangements, including debentures or equivalent local law security documents, held by a security agent on behalf of the lenders.\nDuring FY2025 the Group had an unsecured overdraft facility provided by HSBC of \u00a38.5 million. This facility was replaced with \u00a315.0 million overdraft facility on 30 May 2025 and was subsequently cancelled on introduction of the Receivables Finance Facility.\nDuring the period, the Group cancelled its Asset Backed Lending facility on 30 May 2025 following the disposal of DG Americas. This facility had previously been amended in April 2025 to extend its maturity to June 2027 and reduce the maximum facility amount to $100.0 million. Refer to note 15 of the FY2025 Annual Report for details.\nLoan arrangement fees represent the unamortised costs in arranging the Group facilities. These fees are being amortised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the facilities.\nThe Group is party to supplier financing arrangements with a number of its key customers and the associated balances are recognised as trade receivables until receipt of the payment from the bank, at which point the receivable is derecognised. At 30 September 2025 nothing had been drawn down under this arrangement.\n9.

Financial instruments\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts is assessed using valuation models taking into account market inputs such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves and forward interest rates.\nThere have been no material changes in the fair value measurements of financial instruments or in the valuation techniques and inputs used since the last annual reporting date. For detailed information on the fair value hierarchy (Levels 1-3), valuation techniques, and inputs used, please refer to note 24 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nAll other financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\nThe Group held the following financial instruments at 30 September 2025, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition:\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nTwelve\nsix months\nsix months\nmonths\nended\nended\nended\n30 Sep 2025\n30 Sep 2024\n31 Mar 2025\nForward exchange contracts carrying amount\n$000\n$000\n$000\nDerivative financial assets\n332\n403\n1\nDerivative financial liabilities\n(680)\n(319)\n(534)\nThe Group has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 30 September 2025 designated as hedges of expected future purchases in US dollars for which the Group has firm commitments, as the derivatives are based on forecasts and an economic relationship exists at the time the derivative contracts are taken out. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.\nAssets held for sale\nThe Group had assets held for sale at 30 September 2025 of $0.2 million (HY2025: $5.6 million), which were measured at Level 2 fair value.\n11. Commitments and contingencies\nAt 30 September 2025, the Group had outstanding authorised capital commitments to purchase plant and equipment for $nil (HY2025: $4.9 million). At 30 September 2025, the Group has estimated lease commitments for leases not yet commenced of $nil (HY2025: $18.6 million).\nThe Group has identified a parent company guarantee relating to a lease for an industrial property held by DG Americas. DG Americas was sold in May 2025 and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 in July 2025. At this stage, due to the early stage of bankruptcy proceedings, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial effect of this guarantee. The obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability under IAS 37 and will be reassessed as further information becomes available.\n12.

As previously set out, the FY2026 reported results will include two months of DG Americas' trading losses, associated transaction costs, and non-cash impairment and/or loss on disposal.\nThe continuing Group comprises businesses in the UK, continental Europe and Australia. These businesses have less complex models, and a strong heritage that benefit from long-established and stable relationships with the major retailers. The Group benefits from a combination of well-structured product ranges with a strong focus on design and innovation, supported by a geographically diverse market footprint, trading with 70 countries.\nFinancial\nThe Group's first-half performance reaffirms the Board's expectation that full-year revenues are in line with the previously guided range of $270-280 million. Entering the second half, the Group benefits from strong orderbook visibility at 91%, providing confidence that full-year performance will remain aligned with guidance.\nThe continuing Group (previously DGI) revenue for the period is expected to be c.13% lower than the prior year. This reflects the market headwinds previously communicated at the time of the full-year results, principally softer demand in the UK and the tariff impact on UK sales into the US, but also competitive pricing pressure in Europe. Additionally, c.$7 million of expected revenue has shifted into the second half of the year due to timing of shipments, primarily in Europe.\nAdjusted operating profit from continuing operations for the period is anticipated to be c.$5.6 million (4.3% adjusted operating margin). The Group remains confident that full-year adjusted operating margins will be maintained within the guided range of 3-4%, supported by continued operational efficiencies, disciplined cost control, and a focus on higher-margin channels.\nThe Group ended the period with a net cash position of c.$2 million (HY2025: $7.4 million). Total cash outflow for the period included c.$33 million relating to DG Americas. The continuing Group cash outflow in the period improved by c.13% year-on-year which reflects progress and discipline in cash and working capital management.\nStrategic and Corporate Developments\nThe CEO recruitment process remains underway. Stewart Gilliland remains committed to the role of Interim Executive Chair until an appointment has been finalised.\nHilco's sale process of Design Group Americas, Inc. is progressing, and the potential future net proceeds, if any, will be determined upon completion of the wind-down of the business.\nOutlook\nThe Group enters the second half of the year with strong revenue visibility, a robust orderbook, and a net positive cash position. The Board remains confident in meeting full-year expectations and continues to prioritise opportunities that support sustainable growth in both revenue and margin over the long term.\nFurther details on the performance for the six months, including updated segment reporting, the disposal of DG Americas and the outlook for the remainder of the year, will be provided in the interim results which are scheduled to be published on 2 December 2025.\nFor further information, please contact:\nIG Design Group plc\nTel: +44 (0)1525 887310\nStewart Gilliland, Interim Executive Chair\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nElizabeth Halley-Stott\nAlma Strategic Communications\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0205\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nSam Modlin\nWill Merison\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
