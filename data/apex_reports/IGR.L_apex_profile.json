          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 4928S\nIG Design Group PLC\n11 February 2026\n11 February 2026\nIG Design Group plc\n(the \"Company\", the \"Group\" or \"Design Group\")\nTrading update\nRevenue, profit and cash ahead of expectations\nIG Design Group plc, a leading designer, innovator and manufacturer across various celebration and creative categories, issues a trading update to 31 December 2025, and an update on its outlook. The trading update refers to the continuing business of the Group only, excluding adjusting items and losses related to the disposal of DG Americas announced in May 2025.\nThe Board is pleased to report that trading for the nine months ended 31 December 2025, including performance over the Christmas trading period, has been in line with expectations.\nFor the full financial year ending 31 March 2026 (\"FY2026\"), the Board now anticipates being at the upper end of the previously stated guidance* and above current market consensus**. FY2026 revenues are anticipated to be c.$280-285 million, with final quarter sales expected to be in line with prior year. Adjusted operating margin is also expected to be at the higher end of expectation at c.4%. Together with interest income above current market expectations, this is expected to result in adjusted profit exceeding current market expectations.\nCash performance during the year has been particularly strong, with full-year net cash expected to be c.$55-60 million, which is c.$15-20 million ahead of market expectations*. This outperformance reflects disciplined cash and working capital management across the continuing Group following the disposal of DG Americas. In addition, the sale of a surplus UK warehouse has been provisionally agreed and is expected to close by year end, further strengthening the cash position.\nLooking beyond FY2026, the Board's outlook remains consistent with prior guidance. The underlying business is expected to deliver annual revenue growth of 0-5%, adjusted operating margins of 4-5% and sustainable cash generation of $6-8 million per annum. Alongside this, the Group continues to focus on its long-term growth pillars which are expected to drive incremental value creation beyond the underlying trading performance.\nOn 4 February 2026, the Company announced that all resolutions put to shareholders relating to the capital reduction, to create additional distributable reserves that would allow the Company to make future shareholder distributions, had been approved. The Group expects to publish its FY2026 results in June 2026, which will include an update on its future capital allocation policy.\nThe CEO recruitment process remains underway. Stewart Gilliland remains committed to the role of Interim Executive Chair until an appointment has been finalised.\nThe Group intends to adopt GBP as its presentation currency for consolidated financial statements, replacing USD, effective from the FY2026 full-year results.\n*\nPreviously stated guidance: revenue $270-280 million, adjusted operating margin 3-4% and cash $40-45 million.\n**\nCurrent market consensus: revenue $275 million, adjusted operating profit $9.7 million, adjusted profit $7.6 million and cash $42 million.\nFor further information, please contact:\n\u200b\nIG Design Group plc\nTel: +44 (0)1525 887310\nStewart Gilliland, Interim Executive Chair\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\n\u200b\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nElizabeth Halley-Stott\n\u200b\nAlma Strategic Communications\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0205\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nSam Modlin\nWill Merison\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Revenue for the continuing Group decreased by 13% to $131.4 million. Consistent with full-year guidance, this was primarily driven by softer demand in the UK, the impact of tariffs and competitive pricing pressure in Europe. Despite this, the Group remained profitable, with adjusted operating profit of $5.7 million and a continued focus on sustainable growth. Cash generation and working capital management improved year-on-year, and the Group ended the period with net cash of $1.9 million. Strong orderbook visibility at 96% entering the second half underpins confidence in meeting full-year expectations, with the business well positioned for margin and profit recovery over the medium term.\nDivestment of DG Americas and discontinued operations\nThe Group completed the sale of DG Americas to Hilco on 30 May 2025. Hilco is conducting a realisation of the DG Americas group entities through asset sales and liquidations, with any future net proceeds to the Group contingent on completion of this process. As at 30 September 2025 the fair value measured as expected cash flows from future proceeds was estimated at $nil.\nA loss on the sale of the DG Americas division of $140.3 million has been recognised which, when coupled with $10.1 million of DG Americas trading losses in the period, results in a loss from discontinued operations of $150.4 million.\nComparative information for the prior periods has been represented to reflect the classification of DG Americas as a discontinued operation, consistent with the current period's presentation. Cash flows attributable to discontinued operations are disclosed separately within the cash flow. Refer to note 1 for additional information.\nBoard changes\nPaul Bal stepped down from his role as CEO, following the successful disposal of DG Americas, with Stewart Gilliland assuming the role of Interim Executive Chair. The CEO recruitment process remains underway. Stewart Gilliland remains committed to the role of Interim Executive Chair until an appointment has been finalised.\nMark Tentori, Senior Independent Director and Audit Committee Chair, stepped down from the Board following the AGM in line with governance best practice, as he has been a member of the Board for over nine years. The Board would like to thank Mark for his commitment to the Group over his tenure. John Gittins, who joined the Board in March 2025, has been appointed as Audit Committee Chair and Clare Askem has taken over as Senior Independent Director.\nOutlook and strategy\nThe Board reaffirms the expectation that full-year revenues are in line with the previously guided range of $270-280 million. Entering the second half, the Group benefits from strong orderbook visibility at 96% (HY2025: 88%), providing confidence that full-year performance will remain aligned with guidance.\nThe Group also remains confident that full year adjusted operating margins will be maintained within the guided range of 3-4%.\nFollowing the divestment of DG Americas, the Group is simpler with segments that have a strong heritage and benefit from well-established and stable relationships with the major retailers. These businesses offer structured, design-led product ranges supported by an extensive global footprint. Together, these foundations provide resilience and a strong platform for future growth.\nThe Group is focused on delivering sustainable growth in revenue, margins and cash generation across the UK, continental Europe and Australia. This growth over the coming years will be delivered by focusing on the following long-term drivers: premiumisation, product diversification, customer and channel expansion, and the strengthening of commercial capability. Premiumisation through product enhancement and a more disciplined approach to pricing is expected to reinforce the value proposition and drive sustained margin improvement. Alongside this, diversifying and broadening the portfolio, particularly into higher-margin and under-served categories, will reduce concentration risk and create new, more profitable revenue streams. Expanding customer reach and accessing new channels, will increase distribution and improve operational leverage across the Group. In parallel, strengthening commercial and marketing capabilities will support more consistent execution and scalable growth in line with ambitions. In addition, a disciplined approach to reducing costs, particularly central overheads, will further improve Group margins.\nAs these initiatives progress, the Group expects to deliver sustained revenue growth, margin improvement and better cost efficiency, enabling consistent cash generation and the creation of long-term value for shareholders.\nCapital allocation remains focused on supporting organic growth opportunities, complemented by selective investment in strategic opportunities. Following the sale of DG Americas, the Company currently does not have sufficient distributable reserves to pay a dividend. However, the Group maintains a strong balance sheet and cash position, and a project is underway to create sufficient reserves. The Board expects to provide a further update on this process as and when appropriate. The Board remains fully committed to reinstating shareholder distributions as soon as it is appropriate to do so and will continue to review this in line with the Group's performance, cash position and strategic priorities.\nRegional highlights\nThe continuing Group comprises three reporting segments: DG UK, DG Europe and DG Australia, along with central costs and eliminations. The Group's product categories fall into two key themes: Celebrate and Create. As a leading manufacturer and distributor of celebration products, our ranges help millions of people celebrate life's special moments each year. The Celebrate category is made up of gift packaging (such as giftwrap, greetings cards and gift bags), party products and goods not for resale. The Group's Create products spark imagination, foster creativity, and encourage learning, to help consumers of all ages express themselves and build new skills. This category includes stationery, homeware and craft product categories.\nAcross the Group, there are a combination of well-structured product ranges with a strong focus on design and innovation, supported by a geographically diverse market footprint that spans 70 countries.\nSegmental Revenue\nAdjusted Operating Profit\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n% Group revenue\nHY2026\nHY2025\nChange\nHY2026\nHY2025\nChange\nHY2026\nHY2025\n$m\n$m\n%\n$m\n$m\n%\n%\n%\n45%\nDG Europe\n58.8\n59.0\n-\n7.5\n8.7\n(14)\n12.7%\n14.7%\n38%\nDG UK\n50.3\n71.9\n(30)\n0.7\n7.2\n(90)\n1.5%\n10.0%\n17%\nDG Australia\n22.8\n21.1\n8\n1.7\n1.1\n54\n7.6%\n5.4%\n-\nCentral & Eliminations\n(0.5)\n(0.7)\n(4.2)\n(4.1)\n100%\nTotal\n131.4\n151.3\n(13)\n5.7\n12.9\n(56)\n4.3%\n8.6%\nDG Europe\nDG Europe designs, manufactures and sources across the Celebrate and Create categories. It comprises a manufacturing business in the Netherlands and Poland, primarily serving giftwrap within the Celebrate category and a trading business based in the Netherlands focusing on homeware products within the Create category. The segment's main customers are large value and mass-market retailers.\nRevenue for the period was $58.8 million (HY2025: $59.0 million), broadly in line with the prior year. Performance reflects a pricing decline as a result of the competitive European market, and a timing shift of customer orders into the second half versus the prior year, which offset growth from existing customers in new product categories.\nAdjusted operating profit was $7.5 million (HY2025: $8.7 million), with margins of 12.7% (HY2025: 14.7%). The decline in margin was driven by the pricing investment to maintain competitiveness and market share with value and mass retailers. There was a further impact from the timing shift which offsets freight cost tailwinds from the normalisation of rates from last year's elevated levels.\nDG Europe accounts for 45% of Group revenue, with the second half supported by a strong orderbook covering 99% of full year forecast sales. Looking ahead, the segment is focused on capturing growth opportunities through the expansion of products and customers, while continuing to drive operational efficiency. The clear visibility entering the second half, coupled with this focus on opportunities, provides a solid platform for sustained delivery of full-year results.\nDG UK\nDG UK designs and manufactures around two-thirds of its products across the Celebrate and Create categories, with the majority of sales in Celebrate. UK operations in Wales and Newport Pagnell are supported by a Group sourcing office in China.\nDG UK revenue for the period was $50.3 million (HY2025: $71.9 million), a 30% decrease compared with the prior period. The reduction in sales reflects a combination of softer demand, particularly in the Independents channel, the impact of US tariffs, and a timing element where Christmas orders are being shipped later than prior year. DG UK's largest customer is predominantly US-based, and the introduction of US tariffs resulted in the customer reducing volumes in anticipation of lower consumer demand amid macroeconomic uncertainty. In addition, to mitigate the decline in trading, temporary pricing support was agreed with this customer to help offset the tariff impact. Whilst there were pockets of growth with new business wins among national retailers, this was not sufficient to offset the overall decline.\nAs a result, adjusted operating profit for the period declined to $0.7 million (HY2025: $7.2 million), with the adjusted operating margin falling to 1.5% (HY2025: 10.0%). This performance was partially mitigated by cost savings from the prior year closure of the Huizhou site and continued progress in cost control and action to reduce overheads.\nDuring the period, DG UK completed several operational initiatives aimed at strengthening efficiency and cost base. The successful closure of the Huizhou factory has delivered a leaner cost base and improved sourcing flexibility, reducing the Group's fixed overhead exposure. The re-establishment of a Group sourcing team following the sale of DG Americas allows for coordination with Far East suppliers and supports supply-chain assurance. These actions demonstrate the focus and progress in simplifying the UK operating model, improving cost discipline, and mitigating supply-chain risks. With these foundations in place, DG UK (representing 38% of Group revenue) enters the second half well positioned, supported by strong visibility on full-year sales. The orderbook stands at 87%, in line with the prior year. The robust orderbook, the shift of seasonal shipments into the second half, and a higher-margin sales mix, gives the Board confidence around full-year forecast delivery.\nDG Australia\nDG Australia operates a warehouse facility and sources all of its products, with no in-country manufacturing. The business is focused predominantly on the Celebrate category, offering a wide range of Everyday products including partyware, cards, and giftwrap. Key sales channels include independent retailers and national retail chains, supported by an extensive SKU portfolio.\nDG Australia makes up 17% of Group revenue. Revenue for the period was $22.8 million (HY2025: $21.1 million), an 8% increase year-on-year, reflecting growth across both national and independent channels, particularly within the party products range. Adjusted operating profit increased to $1.7 million (HY2025: $1.1 million), with the margin improving to 7.6% (HY2025: 5.4%) driven by higher sales volumes and an improved margin mix.\nDuring the period, the Australian warehouse relocation was successfully completed following the expiry of the previous lease. The transition was managed effectively, with any short-term disruption recovered through the commitment and hard work of the local team. While the impact in the period was limited, elevated costs are expected from the new and improved facility going forward, reflecting current market rental costs. Despite higher operational costs of this facility, it will support the strategic focus of DG Australia to drive sales growth which will maximise the utilisation of the fixed overhead base. While the market remains competitive, the segment's continually refreshed product portfolio and innovative yet disciplined approach to new product development, position the business for steady progress over the medium term.\nDetailed Financial Review\nThe Group's financial results for continuing operations for the first six months of the year are summarised below. The prior year has been represented on a like-for-like basis for the continuing Group.\nHY2026\nHY2025\nReported\nAdjusting Items\nAdjusted\nReported\nAdjusting Items\nAdjusted\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\nRevenue\n131.4\n-\n131.4\n151.3\n-\n151.3\nGross profit\n25.3\n1.0\n26.3\n35.4\n0.8\n36.2\nGross margin\n19.2%\n20.0%\n23.4%\n23.9%\nOverheads\n(21.0)\n0.4\n(20.6)\n(26.8)\n3.5\n(23.3)\nOperating profit\n4.3\n1.4\n5.7\n8.6\n4.3\n12.9\nOperating margin\n3.3%\n4.3%\n5.7%\n8.6%\nFinance charge\n(0.6)\n0.2\n(0.4)\n(0.6)\n-\n(0.6)\nProfit before tax\n3.7\n1.6\n5.3\n8.0\n4.3\n12.3\nTax\n0.3\n(0.4)\n(0.1)\n(2.2)\n-\n(2.2)\nProfit after tax\n4.0\n1.2\n5.2\n5.8\n4.3\n10.1\nOperating profit\n4.3\n1.4\n5.7\n8.6\n4.3\n12.9\nDepreciation and impairment\n2.5\n-\n2.5\n3.3\n(0.8)\n2.5\nDepreciation of right of use assets\n2.6\n(0.5)\n2.1\n2.4\n-\n2.3\nEBITDA\n9.4\n0.9\n10.3\n14.3\n3.5\n17.9\nDiluted earnings per share\n4.1c\n0.8c\n4.9c\n5.7c\n4.5c\n10.2c\nRevenue from continuing operations decreased by 13% to $131.4 million (HY2025: $151.3 million). The reduction reflects the market headwinds previously communicated, including softer demand in the UK, the impact of tariffs on UK sales into the US and competitive pricing pressure across Europe. In addition, approximately $7 million of expected revenue shifted into the second half of the year due to timing of shipments, primarily within Europe.\nWhen assessed on a constant currency basis, Group revenue decreased by approximately 16%, with a modest positive impact from foreign exchange translation on the reported USD result.\nAdjusted gross profit was $26.3 million (HY2025: $36.2 million), with the adjusted gross margin declining to 20.0% (HY2025: 23.9%). The movement primarily reflects competitive pricing, the impact of tariffs and the resultant impact on operating leverage from lower production volumes.\nAdjusted overheads reduced to $20.6 million (HY2025: $23.3 million), reflecting the benefits of the prior year restructuring actions and continued cost discipline across the Group.\nConsequently, adjusted operating profit for the period was $5.7 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 4.3% (HY2025: $12.9 million, 8.6%), driven by the lower gross profit, partially offset by overhead savings.\nThe Group recorded an adjusted net finance charge of $0.4 million (HY2025: $0.6 million). The net finance charge is made up of financing income of $0.5 million (HY2025: $0.6 million) and $0.9 million of interest costs including lease liability interest (HY2025: $1.2 million). The financing cost improved reflecting reduced borrowing costs, despite lower cash levels throughout the reporting period.\nAdjusted profit before tax was $5.3 million (HY2025: $12.3 million), consistent with the reduction in operating profit.\nAdjusting items before tax of $1.6 million (HY2025: $4.3 million) are comprised primarily of costs relating to the relocation of DG Australia's warehouse operations with transition-related expenses and temporary dual-site running costs.\nAdjusted profit after tax was $5.2 million (HY2025: $10.1 million), with the tax credit in HY2026 primarily reflecting the release of a tax provision. Reported profit after tax for the period was $4.0 million (HY2025: $5.8 million).\nTaxation\nThe taxation credit for the half year on profit before tax is $0.3 million (HY2025: $2.2 million charge) with the effective tax rate at (8.0)% (HY2025: 27.0%). The tax charge on adjusted profit before tax is $0.1 million (HY2025: $2.2 million) with the effective tax rate at 2.4% (HY2025: 17.6%). The effective tax rate in the UK is currently 0% as deferred tax is not recognised; the closure of Huizhou during the year resulted in a release of previously held tax provisions and is the largest contributor to the low adjusted effective rate in the period. The key driver behind the difference between adjusted and reported tax rates is the tax relief received on adjusting items.\nEPS\nDiluted adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations at 4.9 cents (HY2025: 10.2 cents) is reduced year-on-year driven by the decline in profit after tax for the period. Diluted reported earnings per share at 4.1 cents (HY2025: 5.7 cents) is lower than adjusted diluted earnings per share reflecting the adjusting items charge in the period. Further details are set out in note 9.\nCash flow and net cash\nThe Group ended the period with a net cash balance of $1.9 million (HY2025: $7.4 million), representing a year-on-year decrease of $5.5 million, due to a lower cash position at the beginning of the year. Total cash outflow in the period for the continuing Group improved by 16% year-on-year to $47.9 million (HY2025: $57.0 million), despite the revenue shift into the second half, which reflects progress and discipline in cash and working capital management.\nA summary of the Group cash flow is shown below.\nHY2026\n$m\nHY2025\n$m\nAdjusted EBITDA\n10.3\n17.9\nAdd back share-based payment charge\n0.7\n0.6\nMovements in working capital\n(51.2)\n(65.1)\nAdjusted cash used by operations\n(40.2)\n(46.6)\nAdjusting items\n(1.5)\n(3.3)\nCash used by operations\n(41.7)\n(49.9)\nCapital expenditure (net of disposals of property, plant and equipment)\n(2.4)\n(1.8)\nTax paid\n(2.4)\n(3.1)\nInterest received/(paid)\n0.4\n(0.8)\nLease liabilities principal repayments\n(2.7)\n(2.0)\nDividends paid (including those paid to non-controlling interests)\n-\n(0.7)\nFX and other\n0.9\n1.3\nMovement in net cash from continuing operations\n(47.9)\n(57.0)\nDG Americas cash outflow\n(33.3)\n(30.8)\nDG Americas disposal costs\n(1.7)\n-\nMovement in net cash\n(82.9)\n(87.8)\nOpening net cash\n84.8\n95.2\nClosing net cash\n1.9\n7.4\nWorking capital\nIt is usual for working capital levels of the Group to increase steadily in the first half of the year as the manufacturing of seasonal product builds ahead of distribution. The second half of the year sees the inflow of cash following the shipment and collection of Christmas-related receivables. In the period there was a working capital absorption of $51.2 million (HY2025: $65.1 million). This improvement was primarily in Europe, despite the delay in shipments, due to a normalised outflow versus prior year and focus on working capital management.\nCapital expenditure\nCapital expenditure of $2.4 million (HY2025: $1.8 million) increased in the period mainly due to investment in the new warehouse facility for the DG Australia operations.\nDG Americas cash outflow\nTotal cash outflow for the period relating to DG Americas includes $22.7 million of DG Americas cash outflow in the period to 30 May 2025, $10.6 million of cash balance on disposal, and $1.7 million of disposal costs. See note 5 for further details.\nBanking facilities\nOn 11 July 2025, the Group entered into a new Receivables Finance Facility with HSBC and NatWest. The facility has an initial minimum period of 36 months and provides maximum \u00a340 million funding based on a borrowing base linked to eligible receivables across a participating Group companies. Availability under the facility is determined by reference to the value of receivables, subject to eligibility criteria and concentration limits. The facility does not include financial ratio covenants but is subject to certain operational covenants. Further details are set out in note 8.\nForeign exchange exposure management\nThe Group's foreign exchange (FX) exposure is split into two areas:\nTranslational FX exposure\n- The Group's reporting currency is US dollars and the translation exposure is the result of the requirement for the Group to report its results in one currency. This necessitates the translation of our regional business units' local currency financial results into the Group's adopted reported currency. To aid comparability between periods, constant currency figures are provided by retranslating the prior year's results using current year exchange rates. In HY2026, currency movements had a favourable impact. On a constant currency basis, the revenue decline would have been $5.8 million higher, and the decline in adjusted profit before tax would have been $0.5 million greater, had HY2025 results been translated at HY2026 rates.\nTransactional FX exposure\n- The FX exposure is managed carefully by the Group by adopting an active hedging policy to ensure that the foreign exchange movements remain mitigated as far as possible. In addition, a reasonable proportion of hedging is achieved through natural hedges whereby our purchases and sales in US dollars are offset within the Group. The balance of our hedging is achieved through the forward exchange contracts and similar derivatives.\nThe Group intends to adopt GBP as its presentation currency for consolidated financial statements, replacing USD, effective from the FY2026 full-year results. This follows a strategic review of the Group's reporting approach in light of its evolving structure and the disposal of DG Americas, which has materially reduced USD-denominated revenues and profits.\nFinancial position and going concern basis\nThe Group's net assets decreased by $131.2 million since the end of the financial year to $138.9 million at 30 September 2025, driven by the sale of DG Americas. The Directors have continued to pay close attention to their assessment of going concern in preparation of these financial statements. The Group is appropriately capitalised at the year end with a net cash position of $1.9 million and availability of committed borrowing facility.\nThe Directors of the Group have performed an assessment of the overall position and future forecasts for the purposes of going concern. The going concern assessment has been performed using the Group's FY2026 and FY2027 forecasts. A reduction in cash flow volatility following the disposal of the DG Americas business is expected, with the remaining Group forecasted to deliver more stable profitability and cash generation, reflecting continued progress towards a more consistent and resilient financial performance. The forecasts, reviewed by the Board, also incorporate the inherent seasonality of the Group's operations. The forecasts were sensitised to reflect severe but plausible adverse downturns in the current assumptions including the potential impact of the loss of a significant portion of the business with one of our major customers, a recurrence of previous freight rate inflation and a cyber-attack, beyond those risks already factored into the budgets and plans.\nThe base forecasts and additional sensitivity analysis have been tested against the availability of the borrowing facility. The analysis demonstrated that the Group has sufficient headroom to meet its obligations as they fall due for the forecast period of more than twelve months beyond the date of signing these accounts. As such, the Directors do not see any practical regulatory or legal restrictions which would limit their ability to fund the different regions of the business as required as the Group has sufficient resources.\nAccordingly, the Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the interim financial statements.\nRisk\nThe Group operates a decentralised model where risk management is embedded within strategic and operational decision making. The principal risks and uncertainties remain consistent with those disclosed on pages 52 to 57 of our annual report and financial statements 2025. The key risks continue to be macroeconomic uncertainty and strategy. The broader macroeconomic environment is a key risk which impacts the entire business spanning suppliers, customers, consumers and the workforce. Following the sale of DG Americas the Group strategy remains vital to forge the Group's pathway to growth. The Board continues to monitor these factors closely and remains confident that the Group's risk management and control framework remains appropriate and effective, and that the business is well placed to manage the external challenges facing its markets. No new material risks have been identified since the year-end.\nStatement of Directors' responsibilities\nThe Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge that these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information, namely:\n\u00b7\nan indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n\u00b7\nmaterial related-party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related-party transactions described in the last annual report.\nBy order of the Board\nRohan Cummings\nDirector\n2 December 2025\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME

Accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe results for the six months ended 30 September 2024 and the twelve months ended 31 March 2025 have been represented to reflect that the results of DG Americas are now reported as discontinued operations and are therefore reported separately or excluded where required. See note 5 'Discontinued operations' for more information.\nThe condensed financial information contained in this interim report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 435 of the Companies Act\u00a02006 and is unaudited. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 July 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. These interim financial statements are unaudited.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 September 2025 has been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. The interim report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2025, which has been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and any public announcements made by IG Design Group plc during the interim reporting period.\nThe preparation of financial statements that conform with adopted UK IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if relevant.\nThe Group has applied the temporary exception under the Amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules' and has not recognised or disclosed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in the UK and became effective on 1 January 2024. The Group continues to assess the impact of these rules, but they are not expected to have a material effect on the Group's financial position or results.\nFor the purposes of these financial statements, 'Design Group' or 'the Group' means IG Design Group plc ('the Company') and its subsidiaries. IG Design plc is a company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the UK. Its registered office is Howard House, Howard Way, Interchange Park, Newport Pagnell, MK16 9PX. Its shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).\nSeasonality of the business\nThe business of the Group is seasonal and although revenues generally accrue relatively evenly in both halves of the year, working capital requirements, including inventory levels, increase steadily in the first half from July and peak in October as manufacturing of Christmas products builds ahead of distribution. The second half of the year sees the borrowing of the Group decline and move to typically a cash positive position as the Group collects the majority of its receivables through January to March.\nPresentation currency\nThe presentation and functional currency of the Group is US dollars. The functional currency of the Parent Company remains as pound sterling as it is located in the United Kingdom and substantially all of its cash flows, assets and liabilities are denominated in pound sterling, as well as its share capital.\nGoing concern\nInformation regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the detailed financial review above. Cash balances and borrowings and detailed information about the borrowing facilities are detailed in notes 7 and 8.\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue trading for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this report. This expectation is based on the Directors' assessment of the Group's current financial position and future cash flow forecasts over the going concern period. The assessment also considers the structure of the Group's current borrowing facilities. In forming this view, the Directors have also considered the Group's liquidity headroom, its ability to adapt to changes in market conditions, and its capacity to manage principal business risks over the forecast period.\nOn 11 July 2025, the Group entered into a new Receivables Finance facility with HSBC and NatWest, replacing its previous Asset Backed Lending (ABL) arrangement. The new facility is a minimum three-year agreement and provides funding capacity based on the level of eligible receivables across participating Group companies. The facility is subject to certain operational covenants but not financial covenants.\nIn connection with the implementation of this new facility, the Group's \u00a315.0 million overdraft facility was cancelled.\nThe Directors have reviewed detailed forecasts through to 31 March 2027. These indicate a reduction in cash flow volatility following the disposal of the DG Americas division, with the remaining Group expected to deliver more stable profitability and cash generation, reflecting continued progress towards more consistent and resilient financial performance. The forecasts also incorporate the inherent seasonality of the Group's operations.\nThese forecasts have been sensitised to reflect severe but plausible adverse scenarios. Specifically, the scenarios considered the following risks:\n\u00b7\na potential loss of significant trading with a major customer, modelled as a reduction in sales, with associated impacts on cash flow, facility availability, and working capital;\n\u00b7\na sustained period of inflation in freight rates, resulting in additional costs and related cash outflows;\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence of a cyber security incident during peak trading periods, modelled as a temporary reduction in receivables, affecting both liquidity and availability under the Group's receivables-based facility; and\nPlease refer to 2025 Annual Report for further details.\nIndividually and in aggregate, these severe but plausible scenarios do not change the conclusion that the Group has sufficient liquidity and resources to continue as a going concern. Based on this assessment, the Directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nDiscontinued operations\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Discontinued operations are presented separately from continuing operations in the consolidated income statement as a single amount comprising the post-tax results of the discontinued operation and the post-tax gain or loss recognised on its disposal.\nThe assets and liabilities of a disposal group when classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet.\nComparative information for the prior period has been represented, where relevant, to reflect the classification of the disposed business as a discontinued operation, consistent with the current period presentation.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim report are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period and the adoption of new and amended standards. A number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\n2. Segmental information\nThe Group has one material business activity, being the design, manufacture and distribution of various celebration and creative products.\nFollowing the disposal of DG Americas, the Group has introduced new reporting segments, and previously disclosed segments have been re-presented to reflect the current structure.\nThe Group operates under three reporting segments, which are reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Makers. These segments are:\n\u00b7\nDG UK:\nIncludes operations in Wales, Newport Pagnell, and the Group's sourcing offices in Asia.\n\u00b7\nDG Europe\n: Comprises operations in the Netherlands and Poland.\n\u00b7\nDG Australia\n: Represents the Group's joint venture in Australia.\nIn addition,\nCentral and Eliminations\ncover Group head office activities and consolidation adjustments.\nInter\n\u2011\nsegment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.\nFinancial performance of each segment is measured on adjusted operating profit before management recharges. Interest and tax are managed on a Group basis and not split between reportable segments. However, the related financial liabilities and cash have been allocated out into the reportable segments as this is how they are managed by the Group.\nSegment assets are all non-current and current assets. Inter\n\u2011\nsegment receivables and payables are not included within segmental assets and liabilities as they eliminate on consolidation.\nDG\nDG\nDG\nCentral &\nEurope\nUK\nAustralia\neliminations\nGroup\nSix months ended 30 September 2025\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nRevenue - external\n58,839\n49,802\n22,756\n-\n131,397\n- inter-segment\n-\n511\n-\n(511)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n58,839\n50,313\n22,756\n(511)\n131,397\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n7,446\n736\n1,739\n(4,253)\n5,668\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n-\n(247)\n(1,125)\n-\n(1,372)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n7,446\n489\n614\n(4,253)\n4,296\nFinance income\n515\nFinance costs\n(1,157)\nIncome tax\n292\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(150,352)\nLoss for the six months ended 30 September 2025\n(146,406)\nBalances at 30 September 2025\nSegment assets\n104,689\n97,098\n45,592\n2,186\n249,565\nSegment liabilities\n(28,093)\n(52,958)\n(28,446)\n(1,121)\n(110,618)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n534\n614\n619\n1\n1,768\n- intangible assets\n-\n476\n-\n-\n476\n- right-of-use assets\n731\n162\n94\n-\n987\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n953\n1,318\n194\n6\n2,471\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n8\n4\n16\n-\n28\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n638\n759\n1,213\n-\n2,610\nLoss on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n-\n(1)\n(54)\n-\n(55)\nDG\nDG\nDG\nCentral &\nEurope\nUK\nAustralia\neliminations\nGroup\nSix months ended 30 September 2024\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nRevenue - external\n59,011\n71,199\n21,093\n-\n151,303\n- inter-segment\n-\n749\n-\n(749)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n59,011\n71,948\n21,093\n(749)\n151,303\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n8,664\n7,167\n1,129\n(4,010)\n12,950\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n-\n(4,341)\n-\n-\n(4,341)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n8,664\n2,826\n1,129\n(4,010)\n8,609\nFinance income\n605\nFinance costs\n(1,182)\nIncome tax\n(2,166)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(1,498)\nProfit for the six months ended 30 September 2024\n4,368\nBalances at 30 September 2024\nSegment assets\n106,263\n112,542\n28,617\n27,655\n275,077\nSegment liabilities\n(60,068)\n(68,118)\n(10,609)\n(2,687)\n(141,482)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n229\n1,604\n21\n5\n1,859\n- intangible assets\n-\n6\n-\n-\n6\n- right-of-use assets\n34\n165\n92\n-\n291\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n863\n1,474\n133\n13\n2,483\nImpairment - property, plant and equipment\n-\n784\n-\n-\n784\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n7\n16\n17\n-\n40\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n598\n1,221\n593\n4\n2,416\nProfit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n11\n(6)\n7\n-\n12\nDG\nDG\nDG\nCentral &\nEurope\nUK\nAustralia\neliminations\nGroup\nYear ended 31 March 2025\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nRevenue - external\n129,683\n119,435\n40,603\n-\n289,721\n- inter-segment\n75\n824\n-\n(899)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n129,758\n120,259\n40,603\n(899)\n289,721\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n18,583\n7,439\n2,158\n(7,153)\n21,027\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n-\n(6,621)\n(687)\n-\n(7,308)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n18,583\n818\n1,471\n(7,153)\n13,719\nFinance income\n1,519\nFinance costs\n(3,173)\nIncome tax\n(5,904)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n(105,436)\nLoss for the year ended 31 March 2025\n(99,275)\nBalances at 31 March 2025\nSegment assets\n79,902\n87,071\n38,430\n70,121\n275,524\nSegment liabilities\n(27,705)\n(51,594)\n(22,579)\n(45,006)\n(146,884)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n721\n2,296\n812\n15\n3,844\n- intangible assets\n46\n581\n-\n-\n627\n- right-of-use assets\n220\n749\n16,687\n-\n17,656\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n1,726\n2,770\n273\n26\n4,795\nImpairment - property, plant and equipment\n-\n765\n-\n-\n765\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n21\n25\n34\n-\n80\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n1,197\n2,222\n1,561\n8\n4,988\nProfit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n11\n(66)\n23\n-\n(32)\n3.

These\u00a0items are material items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which represent gains or losses and are presented to allow for the review of the performance of the business in a consistent manner and in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis and allow the reader to obtain a clearer understanding of the underlying results of the ongoing Group's operations. They are typically gains or costs associated with events that are not considered to form part of the core operations or are considered to be a 'non-recurring' event (although they may span several accounting periods).\nDG Australia finalised the relocation of its warehousing operations from a long-standing leased facility to a newly secured site. Relocation costs in the reporting period totalled $1.3 million (FY2025: $0.9 million) and included $1.0 million of lease-related and other expenses for the new warehouse, $0.3 million of which were classified as other finance expenses (FY2025: $0.2 million). During the transition, the business incurred double-running costs, as it remained contractually committed to the previous site while establishing full operational capability at the new location. These costs have been treated as adjusting items due to their non-recurring nature and direct link to the relocation.\nAdministrative expenses of $0.3 million relate to the final costs associated with the closure of the China site and the reorganisation of the UK business' sourcing office in the Far East (HY2025: $4.3 million, FY2025: $6.6 million).\nThe cash flow effect of adjusting items from continuing operations\nThere was a $1.5 million net outflow in the current period's cash flow (HY2025: $3.3 million, FY2025: $4.8 million) relating to adjusting items from continuing operations.\n4.

The 2025-2028 LTIP scheme is subject to certain performance criteria being achieved during a three-year period: relative Total Shareholder Return versus FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) constituents; and EPS growth, with an 'underpin' condition to reduce vesting levels if unwarranted 'windfall gains' from share price movements arise. There is a two-year holding period for one individual.\n5. Discontinued operations\nOn 30 May 2025, the Group completed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Design Group Americas, Inc., the holding company of the Group's US division (DG Americas), to HUK 168 Limited, a special purpose vehicle owned by the Hilco Capital group (the 'buyer').\nUnder the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Company received a nominal upfront payment of $1 and may be entitled to 75% of any future net proceeds realised by the buyer from a sale or realisation of DG Americas or its assets, after agreed deductions and to the extent such proceeds are not retained for DG Americas working capital purposes. As at 30 September 2025, and as the buyer progresses with the sale and realisation of the DG Americas assets, the fair value measured as the expected cash flows from the future proceeds was estimated at $nil.\nA loss on sale of DG Americas of $140.3 million was recognised in the consolidated income statement in the current year.\nUnaudited\nsix months\nended\n30 Sep 2025\n$000\nConsideration received\n-\nFair value of contingent consideration\n-\nTotal consideration\n-\nCarrying amount of net assets sold\n(131,210)\nCost to sell\n(2,092)\nLoss on sale before tax and reclassification of translation reserve\n(133,302)\nReclassification of translation reserve\n(6,948)\nIncome tax on sale\n-\nLoss on sale after income tax\n(140,250)\nThe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of disposal on 30 May 2025 were as follows:\nUnaudited\nsix months\nended\n30 Sep 2025\n$000\nNon-current assets\n63,719\nInventory\n116,900\nTrade and other receivables\n42,634\nCash and cash equivalents\n10,624\nIncome tax receivable\n1,868\nTotal assets\n235,745\nTrade and other payables\n(67,688)\nLease liabilities\n(31,211)\nIncome tax payable\n(5,636)\nTotal liabilities\n(104,535)\nNet assets of the disposal group\n131,210\nIn accordance with IFRS 5.32, management has determined that the disposal of DG Americas represents the disposal of a separate major geographical area.

The income tax expense is recognised based on management's estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. The estimated adjusted average annual tax rate used for the period to 30 September 2025 on continuing operations was 2.4% (HY2025: 17.6%). The changes in profit mix across the various territories between H1/H2 as well as non-recognition of taxes in the UK and US are the main drivers that impact the effective tax rate. The tax effect of adjusting items are recognised in the same period as the relevant adjusting item. The deferred tax assets in the UK continue not to be recognised based on the assessment of future taxable profits against which the asset could unwind.\n7.

At 30 September 2024, $2.0 million was drawn down under the Asset Backed Lending (ABL) facility.\nOn 11 July 2025, the Group entered into a new Receivables Finance Facility with HSBC and NatWest. The facility has an initial minimum period of 36 months and provides maximum \u00a340 million funding based on a borrowing base linked to eligible receivables across participating Group companies. Availability under the facility is determined by reference to the value of receivables, subject to eligibility criteria and concentration limits. The facility does not include financial ratio covenants but is subject to certain operational covenants.\nThe Receivables Finance Facility is secured over eligible receivables assigned by participating Group companies. The facility is supported by specific security arrangements, including debentures or equivalent local law security documents, held by a security agent on behalf of the lenders.\nDuring FY2025 the Group had an unsecured overdraft facility provided by HSBC of \u00a38.5 million. This facility was replaced with \u00a315.0 million overdraft facility on 30 May 2025 and was subsequently cancelled on introduction of the Receivables Finance Facility.\nDuring the period, the Group cancelled its Asset Backed Lending facility on 30 May 2025 following the disposal of DG Americas. This facility had previously been amended in April 2025 to extend its maturity to June 2027 and reduce the maximum facility amount to $100.0 million. Refer to note 15 of the FY2025 Annual Report for details.\nLoan arrangement fees represent the unamortised costs in arranging the Group facilities. These fees are being amortised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the facilities.\nThe Group is party to supplier financing arrangements with a number of its key customers and the associated balances are recognised as trade receivables until receipt of the payment from the bank, at which point the receivable is derecognised. At 30 September 2025 nothing had been drawn down under this arrangement.\n9.

Financial instruments\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts is assessed using valuation models taking into account market inputs such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves and forward interest rates.\nThere have been no material changes in the fair value measurements of financial instruments or in the valuation techniques and inputs used since the last annual reporting date. For detailed information on the fair value hierarchy (Levels 1-3), valuation techniques, and inputs used, please refer to note 24 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nAll other financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\nThe Group held the following financial instruments at 30 September 2025, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition:\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nTwelve\nsix months\nsix months\nmonths\nended\nended\nended\n30 Sep 2025\n30 Sep 2024\n31 Mar 2025\nForward exchange contracts carrying amount\n$000\n$000\n$000\nDerivative financial assets\n332\n403\n1\nDerivative financial liabilities\n(680)\n(319)\n(534)\nThe Group has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 30 September 2025 designated as hedges of expected future purchases in US dollars for which the Group has firm commitments, as the derivatives are based on forecasts and an economic relationship exists at the time the derivative contracts are taken out. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.\nAssets held for sale\nThe Group had assets held for sale at 30 September 2025 of $0.2 million (HY2025: $5.6 million), which were measured at Level 2 fair value.\n11. Commitments and contingencies\nAt 30 September 2025, the Group had outstanding authorised capital commitments to purchase plant and equipment for $nil (HY2025: $4.9 million). At 30 September 2025, the Group has estimated lease commitments for leases not yet commenced of $nil (HY2025: $18.6 million).\nThe Group has identified a parent company guarantee relating to a lease for an industrial property held by DG Americas. DG Americas was sold in May 2025 and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 in July 2025. At this stage, due to the early stage of bankruptcy proceedings, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial effect of this guarantee. The obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability under IAS 37 and will be reassessed as further information becomes available.\n12.

For further detail see alternative performance measures reconciliation within the detailed financial review.\n\u00b7\nRevenue fell 13% to $131.4 million reflecting softer UK demand and the impact of US-tariffs, European pricing pressures, and timing of shipments moving into H2.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted operating profit of $5.7 million and adjusted operating margin of 4.3% fell year-on-year due to the impact of lower sales, partly offset by cost savings and freight tailwinds.\n\u00b7\nNet cash closed at $1.9 million, with Group cash outflow improving by 16% year-on-year.\n\u00b7\nOperational progress with the successful completion of Australian warehouse relocation and China site closure underpinning continued focus on efficiency and cost base.\n\u00b7\nCEO recruitment process remains underway with Stewart Gilliland committed to the role of Interim Executive Chair until an appointment has been finalised.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nThe Board reaffirms its full-year guidance of $270-280 million revenue and adjusted operating margin of 3-4%.\n\u00b7\nStrong orderbook visibility entering H2, with 96% of full-year forecast sales, providing confidence in performance.\n\u00b7\nFocus remains on disciplined execution, margin enhancement and sustainable cash generation across all regions.\nStewart Gilliland, Interim Executive Chair, commented:\n\"\nIG Design delivered a solid performance in the period. This was supported by disciplined execution and firm cost-control measures across the Group. While the macroenvironment remains mixed, we know exactly what we need to do to continue strengthening the business. We are confident that our focus on operational efficiency, margin improvement and cash generation will translate into clearer financial traction. We enter the second half as a less complex business than last year, with confidence in our business, stable customer relationships, and a defined pathway to further improvement in profitability and long-term value creation\n.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\n\u200b\nIG Design Group plc\nTel: +44 (0)1525 887310\nStewart Gilliland, Interim Executive Chair\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\n\u200b\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nElizabeth Halley-Stott\n\u200b\nAlma Strategic Communications\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0205\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nSam Modlin\nWill Merison\nOverview\nThe first half of FY2026 reflected the expected transitional period following the sale of DG Americas to Hilco on 30 May 2025. Revenue for the continuing Group decreased by 13% to $131.4 million. Consistent with full-year guidance, this was primarily driven by softer demand in the UK, the impact of tariffs and competitive pricing pressure in Europe. Despite this, the Group remained profitable, with adjusted operating profit of $5.7 million and a continued focus on sustainable growth. Cash generation and working capital management improved year-on-year, and the Group ended the period with net cash of $1.9 million. Strong orderbook visibility at 96% entering the second half underpins confidence in meeting full-year expectations, with the business well positioned for margin and profit recovery over the medium term.\nDivestment of DG Americas and discontinued operations\nThe Group completed the sale of DG Americas to Hilco on 30 May 2025. Hilco is conducting a realisation of the DG Americas group entities through asset sales and liquidations, with any future net proceeds to the Group contingent on completion of this process. As at 30 September 2025 the fair value measured as expected cash flows from future proceeds was estimated at $nil.\nA loss on the sale of the DG Americas division of $140.3 million has been recognised which, when coupled with $10.1 million of DG Americas trading losses in the period, results in a loss from discontinued operations of $150.4 million.\nComparative information for the prior periods has been represented to reflect the classification of DG Americas as a discontinued operation, consistent with the current period's presentation. Cash flows attributable to discontinued operations are disclosed separately withi",

As previously set out, the FY2026 reported results will include two months of DG Americas' trading losses, associated transaction costs, and non-cash impairment and/or loss on disposal.\nThe continuing Group comprises businesses in the UK, continental Europe and Australia. These businesses have less complex models, and a strong heritage that benefit from long-established and stable relationships with the major retailers. The Group benefits from a combination of well-structured product ranges with a strong focus on design and innovation, supported by a geographically diverse market footprint, trading with 70 countries.\nFinancial\nThe Group's first-half performance reaffirms the Board's expectation that full-year revenues are in line with the previously guided range of $270-280 million. Entering the second half, the Group benefits from strong orderbook visibility at 91%, providing confidence that full-year performance will remain aligned with guidance.\nThe continuing Group (previously DGI) revenue for the period is expected to be c.13% lower than the prior year. This reflects the market headwinds previously communicated at the time of the full-year results, principally softer demand in the UK and the tariff impact on UK sales into the US, but also competitive pricing pressure in Europe. Additionally, c.$7 million of expected revenue has shifted into the second half of the year due to timing of shipments, primarily in Europe.\nAdjusted operating profit from continuing operations for the period is anticipated to be c.$5.6 million (4.3% adjusted operating margin). The Group remains confident that full-year adjusted operating margins will be maintained within the guided range of 3-4%, supported by continued operational efficiencies, disciplined cost control, and a focus on higher-margin channels.\nThe Group ended the period with a net cash position of c.$2 million (HY2025: $7.4 million). Total cash outflow for the period included c.$33 million relating to DG Americas. The continuing Group cash outflow in the period improved by c.13% year-on-year which reflects progress and discipline in cash and working capital management.\nStrategic and Corporate Developments\nThe CEO recruitment process remains underway. Stewart Gilliland remains committed to the role of Interim Executive Chair until an appointment has been finalised.\nHilco's sale process of Design Group Americas, Inc. is progressing, and the potential future net proceeds, if any, will be determined upon completion of the wind-down of the business.\nOutlook\nThe Group enters the second half of the year with strong revenue visibility, a robust orderbook, and a net positive cash position. The Board remains confident in meeting full-year expectations and continues to prioritise opportunities that support sustainable growth in both revenue and margin over the long term.\nFurther details on the performance for the six months, including updated segment reporting, the disposal of DG Americas and the outlook for the remainder of the year, will be provided in the interim results which are scheduled to be published on 2 December 2025.\nFor further information, please contact:\nIG Design Group plc\nTel: +44 (0)1525 887310\nStewart Gilliland, Interim Executive Chair\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nElizabeth Halley-Stott\nAlma Strategic Communications\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0205\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nSam Modlin\nWill Merison\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This compares to a margin of 1.75% - 2.25% plus a 0.1% credit adjustment spread over the SOFR under the Group's previous lending facility. The new facility is expected to offer better\nvalue and be simpler to manage.\nThe previous facility ended upon the completion of the disposal of DG Americas.\nThe Board believes that the new facility, which flexes in line with the receivables in the UK and Netherlands, provides more than sufficient headroom to fund the Group's working capital needs over the period of the facility.\nNotice of Results\nThe Group will announce its Full Year Results on Tuesday 29 July 2025.\nFollowing the release of the Company's results, management will be hosting a virtual presentation and Q&A for investors at 11am on 29 July 2025.

We wish Paul all the very best in his next endeavours.\"\nPaul Bal commented:\n\"When I joined the Group just over three years ago, it was clear that there were strong relationships with customers, great products and a committed team - all of which remain today, notwithstanding the challenges faced and the transformation that was needed. I leave the business with my best wishes, pleased that we have protected the wider business with the disposal of DG Americas and knowing that the focus of the team and the Board is firmly on driving the success of DG International.\"\nAs previously announced, the Group expects the publication of its audited financial results for the financial year ending 31 March 2025 (\"FY25\") to be later than under its usual reporting timetable.

The Buyer will receive 25 per cent of any Relevant Proceeds Consideration. There is no ongoing recourse on the Group. IG Design Group plc will also assign to the Buyer any receivables owed by DGA to the Group for the nominal upfront cash payment of one US dollar.\nDGA is the Group's US division and accounts for all the Group's US based operations, with some supporting operations also based in India, Hong Kong, China, the UK, Mexico and Australia. For the financial year ended 31 March 2024, DGA reported audited revenue of $500.3 million and reported operating profit before tax of $4.9 million. As at 30 September 2024, DGA had un-audited net assets of $245.4 million, of which intangibles and deferred tax assets comprised $94.0 million.\nStrategic Rationale and Timing\nAs communicated over a number of years, DGA has been trading in an exceptionally challenging retail environment with softening consumer demand which has resulted in its customers reducing order volumes over successive years. This was compounded at the end of 2024 by bankruptcies amongst DGA's retail customer base, particularly of its fourth largest customer. In 2025 DGA faces even further significant pressure and uncertainty from the new trade tariffs imposed in the US which have severely raised the cost of doing business in the US, and further reduced customer ordering. As announced on 30th April 2025, the Board was reviewing strategic options for DGA, and has now concluded the Disposal is in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.\nThe Disposal will enable the Group to exit a structurally challenged and loss-making part of the business, quickly mitigating the further financial and operational impact the Group would have otherwise experienced. The Disposal is occurring ahead of DGA's seasonal peak working capital period. As such, the Board has sought to act decisively to protect the wider Group.\nMoving forward, the Group will continue its business in the UK, continental Europe and Australia (\"DG International\"). The inclusion of two months of DGA's trading, and some limited transaction costs relating to the Disposal, are expected to adversely impact the financial performance of the Group in the current financial year. However, the Board believes the effect of the Disposal will be to simplify the Group, and focus attention and resource on its stronger performing markets.\nFurther Details on the Disposal\nThe SPA includes a guarantee by Hilco Capital Limited in favour of the Group, in respect of due performance by the Buyer of certain of its obligations under the SPA.\nThe process for the sale or realisation of DGA and/or its assets by the Buyer is not time bound and there is no absolute obligation on the Buyer to sell or otherwise realise DGA or its assets. Nor are there any constraints on what the Buyer can do with DGA under its ownership. The Group will receive its 75% share of the Relevant Proceeds Consideration, if any, as and when the Buyer receives such proceeds. There is no certainty that any Relevant Proceeds Consideration will be realised, and therefore it is possible that the total amount the Group will receive as a result of the Disposal would be limited to one US dollar. If the Buyer were to own and operate DGA in the long-term, without disposing or otherwise realising DGA or its assets, the Group will not receive any Relevant Proceeds Consideration.\nFinancing Arrangements\nUpon completion of the current transaction, the existing US receivables backed asset-based lending (\"ABL\") financing facility will be terminated. The Group is in the process of securing a new three-year financing agreement with its lenders which is expected to conclude by the end of June. The Group's lenders remain supportive and have provided bridging finance to support working capital until the new three-year deal is signed.\nFinancial Results for the year ending 31 March 2025\nDue to the Disposal, the Grou",

          "full_content": "30 Apr 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 7199G\nIG Design Group PLC\n30 April 2025\n30 April 2025\nIG Design Group plc\n(the 'Group')\nFY25 Post-Close Trading Update\nIG Design Group plc, one of the world's leading designers, innovators and manufacturers across various celebration and creative categories, provides an update on its financial performance for the year ended 31 March 2025 and post year end material developments.\nFY25 Group Performance\nThe Group confirms that sales and profit for the year are expected to be in line with the expectations set out in the trading update issued on 17 January 2025. Group revenue declined by 9% year-on-year, reflecting continued challenges across key markets, the US in particular. The Group expects to report an adjusted profit before tax of c$1 million, which is also in line with those expectations.\nDG Americas saw a 12% decline in revenue and was loss making, primarily driven by a very competitive US retail environment. The division is facing into softer consumer demand which has resulted in our customers reducing order volumes. As previously disclosed, this was further compounded by bankruptcies amongst our retail customer base, particularly of the division's 4th largest customer.\nDG International reported a slightly higher than expected 3% decline in revenue but nevertheless is expected to deliver profits in line with expectations, albeit 13% lower than the prior year on a reported currency basis. Profitability in this division declined year-on-year due to a combination of prolonged disruption within a major customer's supply chain, weaker demand in some markets and categories, and high freight rates particularly in the first half of the year.\nDG Americas\nGiven the challenges that are impacting DG Americas' performance, following the January trading update, management undertook an end-to-end review of the businesses and categories within the division with the objective of arriving at a more profitable and resilient business model and footprint within the next two years. Unfortunately, that exercise has been largely overtaken by the widely reported recent developments in trade tariffs.\nAcross the Group c60% of revenue is derived from the US market, with over half of purchases made by DG Americas being sourced from China.\nThe situation is both complex and dynamic given the geographic span of the Group's importing activities and the evolving nature of the tariff regime. However, the Group is beginning to see reductions in customer commitments, and a general reluctance by retailers to accept in full the additional tariff costs. The nature and extent of the impact of tariffs therefore remains difficult to predict. Since the US administration began announcing its new tariff changes, the DG Americas team has been working with customers and suppliers to mitigate the potential impact these could have on the business. Notwithstanding this,\ntariffs have the potential to have a significant adverse effect on the DG Americas performance going forward.\nThis has compelled management to widen the range of strategic options it is prepared to consider for DG Americas and accelerate their evaluation. This includes also considering an exit of the division, and an update could be expected before the publication of the full year results of the Group.\nDG International\nThe recent short-term challenges that the division has faced are now largely resolved and the outlook for this division is positive for the coming years. DG International has a strong heritage and benefits from long established relationships with major retailers with well-structured categories and product ranges. There remain opportunities for growth beyond our traditional strength in the thriving discount channel, particularly around expansion into other channels and product categories given the fragmented competitive landscape, especially across Continental Europe.\nFinancial position\nAs previously disclosed, given the performance and outlook of DG Americas, the Group expects to recognise a very material write-down of its impaired investment in that business. This will be treated as an adjusting item and is a non-cash adjustment. The future financial performance of the Group, and its outlook, will likely be significantly affected by any strategic decision made by the Board on DG Americas.\nThe Group closed the year with a net cash balance of $84 million (FY24: $95 million), surpassing market expectations. The $11 million year-on-year decrease in cash was primarily due to working capital outflows, notably within DG International, where shipments delayed due to supply chain issues at a major retailer hampered H2 sales and increased our inventory levels. Despite the typical seasonal working capital fluctuations, the Group maintained a positive average cash position throughout the year.\nOn 29 April 2025, the Group signed an amendment and extension of its asset-backed-lending agreement which takes the financing arrangement to 5 June 2027.\nStewart ",

These events have required DG Americas to establish significant provisions, circa $15m, to offset its exposure to the amounts receivable from such customers as well as the inventory associated with them\n\u00b7\nFurthermore, the sales performance of our categories at the retail level during the Christmas season versus customer expectations is also leading a number of retail customers to reduce or delay their forward ordering, impacting our future revenue projections, production scheduling and cost absorption\n\u00b7\nAs recently announced, Sue Buchta, the new CEO for DG Americas, has now joined the organisation. Sue brings an exceptional breadth of leadership experience and commercial acumen from a career in the consumer products industry. With her onboarding well underway, Sue will build on the turnaround plan, with a particular focus on how our strategy returns DG Americas to profitable growth.\nOutlook:\n\u00b7\nGiven the aforementioned events, as well as the continuation of challenging retail conditions across both divisions, overall Group revenue for the year ending 31 March 2025 is now expected to be c10% below last year, and therefore below expectations, with both divisions expected to experience decline, with DG Americas estimated to decline c13%, and DG International decline c1%\n\u00b7\nCorrespondingly, FY25 adjusted profit is now expected to be significantly impacted, with profit delivery for the full year around break-even, and well below last year, as well as being significantly below current market expectations (believed to be $32.0m)\n\u00b7\nWhilst the Group was on track to deliver its strategic expectations of returning margins to above proforma pre-pandemic levels of at least 4.5% in FY25, this will now not be realised and our aspirations will have to be re-planned and re-set\n\u00b7\nA strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals.\n\u00b7\nAs communicated at results, it remains too early to comment on what impact, positive or negative, any future changes in international trade tariffs resulting from the incoming US administration will have on the Group\n\u00b7\nUnder these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Pending any other material developments, the Group will provide a further update on its results for the year ending 31 March 2025 in late April 2025, with fuller reporting on 17 June 2025 (\"FY25\") which will include revised management expectations for FY26. Following the recent trading performance of DG America, the Group would now expect to write down the carrying value of its DG Americas division as part of its FY25.\nStewart Gilliland, Chair, commented:\n\"We have been making good progress throughout our turnaround, focusing on our path to growth, developing a strategy of winning with the winning retailers and reducing the complexity across our business. However, the continuing challenging retail backdrop, especially in the US market has undoubtably impacted the performance, position and confidence of many of our customers - with clear winners and losers emerging. Whilst we do work with a significant proportion of the winners,",

However, as stated last month, we anticipate profit improvement in H2. Business simplification, efficiency and cost-saving initiatives will drive profit recovery in H2 such that we expect to deliver a profit in that period, compared to a loss in that period last year. We have executed a number of cost saving initiatives during H1 including the closure of the Chinese manufacturing facility and significant restructuring within DG Americas which positively impacts the higher H2 profitability.\nCash generation remains strong. At the 30 September 2024 the Group ended with net cash of $7.4 million (H1 2023: Net Debt $15.1 million) driving a positive average cash balance for the period.\nOutlook for the full year:\nThe Board believes the trading results for the full year to 31 March 2025 remain in line with its revised expectations\nas communicated at the Group's AGM statement last month\n. This represents strong year-on-year improvement in both profit and cash flow compared to the prior financial year. It will also deliver the Board's aspiration to return the Group to pre-pandemic operating margins of at least 4.5% by the end of FY2025.\nFurther details on the performance for the six months,\u00a0and the outlook for the period ahead, will be set out with the Company's interim results to be published on 26 November 2024.\nFor further information, please contact:\nIG Design Group Plc\nPaul Bal, Chief Executive Officer\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\nTel:\u00a0+44 (0)1525 887310\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nBobbie Hilliam\nHarry Pardoe\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nAlma Strategic Communications\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nSam Modlin\nWill Merison\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0209\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Notwithstanding this, we continue with the turnaround of the DG Americas business, reducing the complexity that was built over successive acquisitions, and improving margins through more simplification and better leverage of its scale.\nAt the time of our Full Year Results, we announced that the DG Americas division had seen revenue decline 16%. This was mainly driven by reduced demand for certain categories, from Everyday product categories to Seasonal ones, as our main customers ordered more cautiously ahead of seasonal peaks, especially Christmas 2023. In addition, we were carefully managing our credit risk exposure, which weighed on revenues, as some of our US retail customers gave us cause for concern. These trends have continued into the current financial year with revenue in DG Americas declining c14% for the period.\nThe CEO of DG Americas left the business in July 2024, and we are actively recruiting a successor who will complete DG Americas' transformation journey sooner and return that business to profitable revenue growth. Until the new DG Americas CEO has been successfully onboarded, the DG Americas top-team are reporting directly to Paul Bal, who is now visiting the US regularly. To facilitate this, other Board members and senior leaders are supporting certain of Paul's responsibilities across the rest of the Group.\nDG International continues to perform well and in line with the Board's expectations, with continued growth from our key customers in continental Europe offset by ongoing softness in the UK and Australian markets.\nOverall Group revenue has declined c13% in the period compared to prior year. Whilst the H1 versus H2 revenue split is expected to remain similar to the prior year, we anticipate an improvement in H2 profitability driven by the timing of benefits from strategic initiatives and mix improvements.\nNet Cash continues to be strong, and the Group has been cash positive for the entire five month period, with cash balances well in excess of the prior year.\nOutlook for the full year:\nWith the order book now c77% complete at this point (FY2024 equivalent: 77%), we anticipate Group revenue to decline c5% for the full year, mainly driven by the trends we are experiencing in DG Americas.\nNotwithstanding the challenges in DG Americas, the Group's Operating Profit is expected to grow year-on-year, and the margin is still expected to return to above proforma pre-pandemic levels of at least 4.5%.\nThe Group expects to deliver in excess of 20% year-on-year adjusted profit growth, however, as a result of the lower expected revenue, the Group now expects results for the year to be below, but within 10% of, previous market profit expectations and towards the lower end of the Board's profit expectations.\nThe Board recognises the increased difficulties being faced in some of the markets in which we operate and thank our teams everywhere for their determination to deliver to their best ability in the circumstances.\nOn completing the first half of our year, the Board will provide another trading update on 29 October 2024 as previously scheduled. The publication of the half year results is scheduled for 26 November 2024.\nFor further information, please contact:\nIG Design Group Plc\nPaul Bal, Chief Executive Officer\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\nTel:\u00a0+44 (0)1525 887310\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nBobbie Hilliam\nHarry Pardoe\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nAlma Strategic Communications\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nSam Modlin\nWill Merison\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0209\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

An 'underpin' condition also applies to the awards that allows the Remuneration Committee to reduce vesting levels if it determines that vesting outcomes reflect unwarranted 'windfall gains' from share price movements.

The year has also seen the start of balancing our focus on the recovery journey with establishing a longer-term strategy to return the Group to sustainable growth, which is requiring a lot of consistent effort from everyone across the organisation. So, I would like to thank my colleagues throughout the Group for their hard work in delivering this year's strong results and the progress on our strategy.\nWith an invigorated senior leadership across the Group, our financing secured and a strengthened and stable Board, the Group is well-set to complete its recovery over the coming year; and embark on an exciting growth-focused strategy for the years beyond. Whilst the global political-economic backdrop could be better, the continued support of our customers and suppliers, who are working closely with our talented teams, positions us well to deliver better shareholder value.

          "full_content": "30 Apr 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 4761M\nIG Design Group PLC\n30 April 2024\n30 April 2024\nIG Design Group Plc\n('Design Group' or the 'Group')\nTrading Update for the 12 months ended 31 March 2024\nSignificant growth in profit and strong cash flow, ahead of expectations\nIG Design Group plc, one of the world's\nleading designers, innovators and manufacturers across various celebration and creative categories\n, provides an update on its financial performance for the year ended 31 March 2024.\nThe Group has continued to make good progress on its turnaround journey of improving operational efficiency and simplifying the business. These initiatives have resulted in significant growth in profit and margin for the year. The Group expects to deliver adjusted profit before tax of $25.9m (FY23: $9.2m), which is ahead of market expectations. The Group's adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be c3.8% which is a further recovery of 200 bps on the previous year.\nThe Group expects to deliver revenue for the year in line with expectations of c$800 million. This is a 10% reduction year-on-year and is split between the Group's divisions as follows:\n-\nThe DG Americas division experienced a decline of c16%. This was mainly in the first half of the year which was down 24% due to lower volume across a number of categories. Pleasingly during the second half of the year, revenue stabilised and was down c1%.\n-\nThe DG International division was in line with prior year on a reported currency basis. Softness in the UK and Australia markets was more than offset by continued momentum across continental Europe.\nFinancial position\nThe Group closed the year with a net cash balance of $95 million (FY23: $50m), a $45m year-on-year increase which is well ahead of market expectation. The Group was average cash positive for the year despite its traditional seasonal cycle of working capital movements. This improved cash position was driven by increased profitability and continued improvements in working capital management throughout the Group.\nMoving forward, the cash position of the Group is expected to continue strengthening due to its financial performance and sale of freehold sites following footprint consolidation in the DG Americas division.\nThe Group expects to make a provision of c$5.5m* for potential liabilities relating to pre-acquisition era duties owed in the DG Americas division and is taking legal advice on the matter. Due to the historic nature of this issue, the results for the year ended 31 March 2024 will be adjusted accordingly.\n* Subject to further legal review\nOutlook\nThe financial performance delivered in the year has been ahead of expectations and reflects the Board's aspiration to return to pre-Covid adjusted operating profit margins of 4.5% by 31 March 2025.\nThe increase in profitability came from both divisions, with the DG Americas division growing 132% (c$4m) and DG International growing 61% (c$12m). Whilst the Board expects momentum to continue into the year ahead; more of the profit growth should come from the DG Americas division. Management initiatives to underpin this track in line with expectations.\nThe Board is pleased with the operational progress and financial performance of the Group. As highlighted in our interim results, there remains caution in consumer shopping behaviour which holds down demand in certain markets and product categories. That said, actions taken over the past two years provide confidence in the delivery of the expectations for the year ahead, with the Group on track to deliver on its margin target for 31 March 2025.\nPaul Bal, CEO, commented:\n\"I am delighted with our progress in improving operational efficiency and simplifying our business. Through our work, we have delivered another year with significant improvement in profit and margin. I thank all of my colleagues for their hard work as we continue on our journey.\nLooking ahead, whilst the external environment remains uncertain, we remain confident that our strategy is the right one, and that we will achieve our aspiration to return the Group to pre-Covid-19 adjusted operating profit margins by 31 March 2025.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nIG Design Group Plc\nPaul Bal, Chief Executive Officer\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\nTel:\u00a0+44 (0)1525 887310\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nBobbie Hilliam\nAlex Orr\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nAlma Strategic Communications\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nSam Modlin\nJosh Royston\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0209\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as amended by regulation 11 of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019/310.

          "content": "Small crumbs of comfort here. A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Last quarters trading update and half year results management was still predicting good results. The piworld interview also painted a good picture. Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts. I just hope they don't do a knee-jerk sale of America's to a PE firm for a dollar - just wait for full tariffs outcome.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels).

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap.

I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will.

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

          "content": "Having taken a large position in Feb/March, thinking the market had totally mis-priced this company, I continue to be excited about the long term potential of IGR, particularly with the new management team now firmly established. I run a company in a related field (with same seasonality) and are similarly repricing operational risks, so margins are improving, despite constant flow of macro curveballs (Red Sea etc).  Pricing discipline is key, as well as colloborative relationships with key customers. Given retailers are largely now committed to Xmas orders (they do so in March/April each year given long lead times), the final results outlook for FY25 would have been written in the knowledge that internally there's very good visibility for FY25, so I view the statement as a very reliable indicator for the projected outturn (see Progressive Research note re FY25E). Don't be alarmed, come the interims, that the cash has all disappeared, as this is the seasonality effect kicking in (basically, like IGR, we borrow for 3 months and lend to the bank for the rest of the year!).   Best to look at EV/EBITDA valuation metrics at the year end not the interims, as you would get wildly different answers. You never know they might surprise at the interims and restart the dividend, but I'm expecting this at the full year. Enjoy the ride to current fair value in excess of \u00a33 per share by end of April 2025 when they issue the FY25 trading update (by which time they would also have pretty good forecasting confidence re FY26 and once again the Progressive  projections look reasonable IMO).",

If the sp, can maintain it's value above 195, and preferably 200, for a second day, buy. A price target of 260 seems reasonable based on trough to second subsequent peak extension. Two year chart view shows only overhead supply from previous trading from 17/5/24. Overhead supply, can soak up new trading volume, potentially slowing down a rally. DYOR.",

          "content": "The nervousness re freight cost increases will be the main reason behind the fall.  I put the question to the CEO/CFO at the results presentation re freight and they seemed much better prepared for this, such as negotiating FOB contracts with their customers, so the retailer takes the freight risk on shipments from China.  There's also contracts with the shipping lines, offering a hedge against volatility. As I mentioned previously I run a similar business so have first hand experience of the current freight issues.  The length of time to ship items went up by 2 weeks from the usual 4 weeks due to re-routing from the Red Sea, some months ago, and crucially before tenders were issued, so the elevated costs could be baked into proposals.  The extended lead times then caused importers to bring forward production/shipping plans and prices rose. However, there's a shortage of containers also caused by: - Chinese companies sending in loads of stock to the US before the Biden tariffs came in on things like EVs. - Major building of car manufacturing plants in South America by Chinese forms and filling up thousands of containers with all the parts, taking capacity out of the market. The result is containers all over the world in places where it wouldn't normally be. Although spot rates to Europe are nearing $10k per 40ft container for 2nd half of July, I'm expecting this to come off the boil as we move through the remainder of the year. Despite the supply chain turbulence of late, I'm still comfortable with the margin expectations for FY25 and have taken the opportunity to increase my holding to 0.1% of the share capital, as the new management team are highly credible, understand the risk drivers and are very focussed on delivering shareholder value in the years ahead as they execute the strategic plan.",

          "content": "Small crumbs of comfort here. A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts. I just hope they don't do a knee-jerk sale of America's to a PE firm for a dollar - just wait for full tariffs outcome.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels).

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap.

I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will.

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

Plus they have no factories in China to mothball. So yes they will be the overall winners, eg someone Has to supply Xmas crackers to USA. Brilliant set of results given the circumstances. Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts. I just hope they don't do a knee-jerk sale of America's to a PE firm for a dollar - just wait for full tariffs outcome.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels). Lastly, I expected it to tank when I read the trading update\u2026 so what do I know? \ud83d\ude05",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

          "content": "Having taken a large position in Feb/March, thinking the market had totally mis-priced this company, I continue to be excited about the long term potential of IGR, particularly with the new management team now firmly established. I run a company in a related field (with same seasonality) and are similarly repricing operational risks, so margins are improving, despite constant flow of macro curveballs (Red Sea etc).  Pricing discipline is key, as well as colloborative relationships with key customers. Given retailers are largely now committed to Xmas orders (they do so in March/April each year given long lead times), the final results outlook for FY25 would have been written in the knowledge that internally there's very good visibility for FY25, so I view the statement as a very reliable indicator for the projected outturn (see Progressive Research note re FY25E). Don't be alarmed, come the interims, that the cash has all disappeared, as this is the seasonality effect kicking in (basically, like IGR, we borrow for 3 months and lend to the bank for the rest of the year!).   Best to look at EV/EBITDA valuation metrics at the year end not the interims, as you would get wildly different answers. You never know they might surprise at the interims and restart the dividend, but I'm expecting this at the full year. Enjoy the ride to current fair value in excess of \u00a33 per share by end of April 2025 when they issue the FY25 trading update (by which time they would also have pretty good forecasting confidence re FY26 and once again the Progressive  projections look reasonable IMO).",

I put the question to the CEO/CFO at the results presentation re freight and they seemed much better prepared for this, such as negotiating FOB contracts with their customers, so the retailer takes the freight risk on shipments from China.  There's also contracts with the shipping lines, offering a hedge against volatility. As I mentioned previously I run a similar business so have first hand experience of the current freight issues.  The length of time to ship items went up by 2 weeks from the usual 4 weeks due to re-routing from the Red Sea, some months ago, and crucially before tenders were issued, so the elevated costs could be baked into proposals.  The extended lead times then caused importers to bring forward production/shipping plans and prices rose. However, there's a shortage of containers also caused by: - Chinese companies sending in loads of stock to the US before the Biden tariffs came in on things like EVs. - Major building of car manufacturing plants in South America by Chinese forms and filling up thousands of containers with all the parts, taking capacity out of the market. The result is containers all over the world in places where it wouldn't normally be. Although spot rates to Europe are nearing $10k per 40ft container for 2nd half of July, I'm expecting this to come off the boil as we move through the remainder of the year. Despite the supply chain turbulence of late, I'm still comfortable with the margin expectations for FY25 and have taken the opportunity to increase my holding to 0.1% of the share capital, as the new management team are highly credible, understand the risk drivers and are very focussed on delivering shareholder value in the years ahead as they execute the strategic plan.",

But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels).

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

          "content": "Small crumbs of comfort here. A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels). Lastly, I expected it to tank when I read the trading update\u2026 so what do I know? \ud83d\ude05",

Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts. I just hope they don't do a knee-jerk sale of America's to a PE firm for a dollar - just wait for full tariffs outcome.",

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels). Lastly, I expected it to tank when I read the trading update\u2026 so what do I know? \ud83d\ude05",

Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts.

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels). Lastly, I expected it to tank when I read the trading update\u2026 so what do I know? \ud83d\ude05",

Plus they have no factories in China to mothball. So yes they will be the overall winners, eg someone Has to supply Xmas crackers to USA. Brilliant set of results given the circumstances. Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts. I just hope they don't do a knee-jerk sale of America's to a PE firm for a dollar - just wait for full tariffs outcome.",

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Last quarters trading update and half year results management was still predicting good results. The piworld interview also painted a good picture. Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

          "content": "Small crumbs of comfort here. A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels). Lastly, I expected it to tank when I read the trading update\u2026 so what do I know? \ud83d\ude05",

Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts.

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels). Lastly, I expected it to tank when I read the trading update\u2026 so what do I know? \ud83d\ude05",

          "full_content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 4928S\nIG Design Group PLC\n11 February 2026\n11 February 2026\nIG Design Group plc\n(the \"Company\", the \"Group\" or \"Design Group\")\nTrading update\nRevenue, profit and cash ahead of expectations\nIG Design Group plc, a leading designer, innovator and manufacturer across various celebration and creative categories, issues a trading update to 31 December 2025, and an update on its outlook. The trading update refers to the continuing business of the Group only, excluding adjusting items and losses related to the disposal of DG Americas announced in May 2025.\nThe Board is pleased to report that trading for the nine months ended 31 December 2025, including performance over the Christmas trading period, has been in line with expectations.\nFor the full financial year ending 31 March 2026 (\"FY2026\"), the Board now anticipates being at the upper end of the previously stated guidance* and above current market consensus**. FY2026 revenues are anticipated to be c.$280-285 million, with final quarter sales expected to be in line with prior year. Adjusted operating margin is also expected to be at the higher end of expectation at c.4%. Together with interest income above current market expectations, this is expected to result in adjusted profit exceeding current market expectations.\nCash performance during the year has been particularly strong, with full-year net cash expected to be c.$55-60 million, which is c.$15-20 million ahead of market expectations*. This outperformance reflects disciplined cash and working capital management across the continuing Group following the disposal of DG Americas. In addition, the sale of a surplus UK warehouse has been provisionally agreed and is expected to close by year end, further strengthening the cash position.\nLooking beyond FY2026, the Board's outlook remains consistent with prior guidance. The underlying business is expected to deliver annual revenue growth of 0-5%, adjusted operating margins of 4-5% and sustainable cash generation of $6-8 million per annum. Alongside this, the Group continues to focus on its long-term growth pillars which are expected to drive incremental value creation beyond the underlying trading performance.\nOn 4 February 2026, the Company announced that all resolutions put to shareholders relating to the capital reduction, to create additional distributable reserves that would allow the Company to make future shareholder distributions, had been approved. The Group expects to publish its FY2026 results in June 2026, which will include an update on its future capital allocation policy.\nThe CEO recruitment process remains underway. Stewart Gilliland remains committed to the role of Interim Executive Chair until an appointment has been finalised.\nThe Group intends to adopt GBP as its presentation currency for consolidated financial statements, replacing USD, effective from the FY2026 full-year results.\n*\nPreviously stated guidance: revenue $270-280 million, adjusted operating margin 3-4% and cash $40-45 million.\n**\nCurrent market consensus: revenue $275 million, adjusted operating profit $9.7 million, adjusted profit $7.6 million and cash $42 million.\nFor further information, please contact:\n\u200b\nIG Design Group plc\nTel: +44 (0)1525 887310\nStewart Gilliland, Interim Executive Chair\nRohan Cummings, Chief Financial Officer\n\u200b\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nElizabeth Halley-Stott\n\u200b\nAlma Strategic Communications\nTel: +44 (0)20 3405 0205\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\ndesigngroup@almastrategic.com\nSam Modlin\nWill Merison\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

I think the competition from China is what has eroded margins for the likes of IGR. A lot of lessons will have been lot by the IG Design Group board over the Christmas period, and with DG Americas under new management, I expect a turnaround to unfold next year. I hope the company becomes much more selective about who it sells to, both from a security of earnings prospective and from a margin enhancing perspective. I would also personally consider selling of DG Americas, and suspect that this could be the plan moving forward. I think this would be the best way to unlock value. With how cheap the stock is now, the company barely needs to a show a profit moving forward to justify this valuation imo. Oversold imo. All in my honest opinion. Do your own research.",

Then only last wk scsw picked this as one of their picks for the year, obviously they would have talked to management prior to posting this probably in December. Then 2 weeks into the new year yesterdays bombshell hit! This share has lost over 75% of hits value since hitting \u00a32.40 only a few months ago! This stinks of management ineptness or even fraud. Imo IGR have kitchen sinked this and have an agenda, I would hope to see lots of directors buying in at this ridiculously low price, back of my hand working out even if we break even this year on asset value alone should still be worth about \u00a32 a share. I also hope the bottom was in yesterday at 55p and we'll get a rerate up over the coming weeks and months. Good luck to all holders.",

A strong net cash position is still expected to remain at the year-end, albeit being lower than previous expectations given the reduced profit delivery and expected lower receivables recovery due to customer in protective arrangements or bankruptcy procedures. The Company also continues to expect cash proceeds from property disposals. Progressive has this at $63.4m at the year end. And, of course, the huge discount to net current assets remains. But the timeframe for these becoming productive is now kicked into the unknown: Under these challenging circumstances, at this stage, and until the recent events are more fully assessed, the Board is no longer able to provide guidance for the years beyond FY25. Management credibility has taken a huge hit here. After all, less than a month ago, they gave a number of very specific reasons why they expected DG Americas profitability to recover in H2. The reality has been far from that and means they\u2019ve pretty much gone from hero to zero in one step.However, the 60%+ fall this week also looks overdone. Even with write-downs from one of their customers entering Chapter 11, the discount to Tangible Book Value is huge. Indeed, the expected cash balance at year-end covers almost 90% of the current market cap. The market is pricing this as if their receivables and inventory are largely worthless. This may be the case, but it seems far from the central outcome we should be using. The shares are trading not far off the level when the company was facing the real risk of insolvency, something that is no longer the case today. It will be a long wait for any recovery, though. With management credibility shot, the market will no longer value this on forecasts but will want to see profitability over an extended period before believing that DG Americas has actually been turned around.",

Come on, it had 245m USD net assets and 500m turnover! It was worth 50m to 100m (think about all those valuable assets there). This was the worst possible time to sell it whilst the US and China hammer out a trade deal. I hope they cast their net to 500 PE firms and not just 5. I bought CRL 3 years ago for 35p and have sat on it even as it fell below 20p last year. Finally, finally I'm in the black. In hindsight maybe it wasn't a quality company like you mentioned albeit it did recently buy brands and focused on them. I hope they do eventually get to 100p but even 60p will be great. JJB has been a multibagger in the past but I can't get my head around investing in a retail company that now has massive dollar debts since their crazy acquisition a year ago. They are just a retailer with no moat or brand, at least Sports Direct owned Slazenger, etc. Finally, finally UK value stocks are rising after many years,which I suspect is due to UK and world investors exiting American stocks.",

I don\u2019t treat receivables or inventory etc like they\u2019re cash. I fully understand your view on this and SFR. It hasn\u2019t been easy sitting on my hands looking at these opportunities, but I prefer to own exceptionally strong businesses, especially while they\u2019re also cheap. In the words of Buffett \u2018I like a sure bet\u2019, and I don\u2019t have to swing at every ball thrown in my direction. So I\u2019m a value investor, but with a huge focus on quality. I\u2019d rather invest in a great company while it\u2019s cheap, than a mediocre company while it\u2019s bargain. I\u2019ve had my fingers burnt with the latter with IGR (albeit I sold most of my shares before the crash) and with CRL (did the same, but took a loss there on my 2nd term of owning it after owning it from around 50p up to \u00a31.25 previously). JD is over 20% of my portfolio atm, but ideally, I\u2019d like it to be 15%. It\u2019s far too cheap for me to trim atm though. I don\u2019t own any ETFs, and tbh, I never will. My condolences for the Argentex loss. I personally avoid those types of companies as I see them as much higher risk than most investors do.",

I think selling off DG Americas would be the right move personally, but I agree, a knee-jerk sale isn\u2019t required. There must be a company out there who can drive some synergistic benefits out of DG Americas. If I was still invested here, I wouldn\u2019t be panicking, but I can\u2019t say today\u2019s update filled me with much positivity. Something IGR might benefit from is the scrapping of the de minimis rule (should help protect the company against the likes of Temu etc). I won\u2019t be buying back in as I\u2019ve restructured my investing strategy, but I do think holders will eventually see a nice profit from this (from these levels). Lastly, I expected it to tank when I read the trading update\u2026 so what do I know? \ud83d\ude05",

Plus they have no factories in China to mothball. So yes they will be the overall winners, eg someone Has to supply Xmas crackers to USA. Brilliant set of results given the circumstances. Their risk of bankruptcy or capital calls is now gone given their stronger than expected net cash position. They just need to vet and insure who they supply to to avoid bad debts. I just hope they don't do a knee-jerk sale of America's to a PE firm for a dollar - just wait for full tariffs outcome.",
