Alongside this, prudent trading decisions have been made in the US market when working with customers that posed increased credit risk. These factors, coupled with some markedly increased costs over the period, such as freight, resulted in a 62% drop in\nadjusted operating profit\nto $14.7 million.\nRevenue\nin DG Americas declined 14%, across both seasonal and everyday categories, while DG International declined 6%, with growth in continental Europe offsetting softening in the UK and Australia markets.\nDespite these pressures, operational improvements are underway which will deliver further benefits and margin improvements in the second half of the year, with key strategic initiatives, such as the cessation of in-house manufacturing in China and a restructuring in DG Americas, beginning to take effect. The second half of the year should also see some softening in freight costs.\nNet cash continues to be strong, and the Group has been cash positive for the entire six month period. Cash balances have also exceeded prior year levels, reflecting another period of strong cash management. The Group expects to end the year in a strong net cash position.\nMany of our teams and our customers have had to work through some very challenging market conditions, as many consumers still struggle with higher costs of living, higher interest rates and higher tax burdens over the period. It is a testament to our teams and their high level of engagement with, and dedication to the business that the Group is able to better able to navigate this environment.\nOutlook\nThis is our third year of the Group's three-year turnaround journey and despite some of the markets we operate in becoming much tougher than when that journey began, we remain confident that we can restore adjusted operating profit margin to the Board's aspiration of at least the 4.5% that was the proforma pre-pandemic margin following the acquisition of CSS in March 2020, by the end of the year. This represents continued strong year-on-year improvement in both profit and cash flow compared to the prior financial year, albeit towards the lower end of the Board's profit expectations set at the start of the year.\nWe continue to progress on our strategy, building the capabilities that our customers value, which will give us competitive advantage and deliver sustainable profitable revenue growth. However, we must continue with reducing complexity that does not provide commensurate returns. The goal remains of creating a more resilient business model that can better withstand market challenges. Business model simplification, efficiency and cost-saving initiatives across the Group, especially in DG Americas, will drive profit recovery in the second half of the year such that we expect to deliver a profit in that period, compared to a loss in that period last year.\nThe economic and geo-political backdrop remains fragile and uncertain in some of our key markets, especially the US, with consumer sentiment understandably subdued, resulting in a very competitive retail environment. This is prompting us to remain cautious in how we manage our exposures. However, we remain encouraged and confident that our strategy of winning with the winning retailers is the right one. Our orderbook stands at 84% at October 2024 (86% at this stage last year) which reflects the delayed ordering from customers in the uncertain market conditions. Despite the slightly reduced orderbook this year, we remain confident in the strength of our partnership with the winning retailers. Our strong, longstanding relationships with our customers, along with price competitiveness, increased collaboration and improved service are key to navigating the challenges faced as a result of this uncertain landscape.\nDuring and since the recent US presidential elections, there has been much speculation and press coverage on the subject of international trade tariffs. It is not yet clear how the tariff regime in the US will change, nor how other countries will respond to any changes. Therefore, the Board cannot yet comment on how this will affect our future trading. As a domestic manufacturer of a number of categories there may be some positive impact that offsets any potential inflationary consequences. As the incoming new US Government's plans are communicated, we will then be in a position to evaluate the opportunities and risks that any changing tariffs will present.\nThe Group has reviewed the implications of the recent budget announcement by the UK Government. As part of its forecasting, the Board anticipated some of the changes that were announced such as the increase in the National Minimum Wage. The reduction in the National Insurance threshold was not anticipated, and when combined with the rise in the employers' National Insurance rate to 15% the effect is to add c.$0.7 million to the Group's annual operating costs from next year.\nRegional highlights\nRevenue\nin the period declined 11% reflecting the continuation of trends seen last year including lower consumer demand leading to reduced ordering by our retail customers, as well as our careful management of our credit risk exposure to some customers. This decrease in\nrevenue\n, coupled with increased sourcing, manufacturing and freight costs resulted in an\nadjusted operating profit\ndecline of 62% to $14.7 million. The split between our DG Americas and DG International divisions is as follows:\nSegmental Revenue\nAdjusted Operating Profit/ (Loss)\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n% Group revenue\nHY2025\nHY2024\n% growth\nHY2025\nHY2024\n% growth\nHY2025\nHY2024\n62%\nDG Americas\n$m\n241.8\n282.4\n(14)%\n1.7\n16.6\n(90)%\n0.7%\n5.9%\n38%\nDG International\n$m\n151.3\n161.7\n(6)%\n16.9\n25.3\n(33)%\n11.2%\n15.7%\nElims / Central costs\n$m\n-\n-\n(3.9)\n(3.7)\n-\n100%\nTotal\n$m\n393.1\n444.1\n(11)%\n14.7\n38.2\n(62)%\n3.7%\n8.6%\nDesign Group Americas\nThe DG Americas division, which makes up 62% of Group\nrevenue\n, continued to face revenue challenges during the period, with a 14%\nrevenue\ndecline to $241.8 million (HY2024: $282.4 million). This decrease is driven by reduced demand across both seasonal and everyday categories as our retail customers ordered more cautiously in light of the economic backdrop and subdued consumer sentiment. Whilst mix and pricing was positive, as we sought to recover margin, volume was down significantly as customers reduced order quantities. Some of this volume decline may be attributable to the uncertainty felt in the run-up to the recent US presidential elections, though this is difficult to gauge. Whilst we won additional tenders, the market remains very competitive which has also reduced volumes and resulted in net lost business. Further to this, our cautious approach to managing credit risk exposure, given the current economic conditions, further impacted revenues. The year-on-year revenue decline spans various product categories, most significantly impacting more discretionary spend such as ribbons & bows (within gift packaging), stationery and partyware (within party). This was particularly evident in the value and mass channel, but which is expected to see some recovery in the second half of the year as that channel gains most in the present consumer climate. The Independents channel also experienced lower consumer demand, and this looks more prolonged. Despite the challenges, there were positive developments with craft and patterns continuing to perform well, and core gift wrap showed resilience. It is also pleasing to see e-commerce sales have grown year-on-year, reflecting our increased strategic focus on this.\nThe loss of revenue resulted in\nadjusted operating profit\nfalling to $1.7m in the period. Rising raw material, manufacturing and freight costs put further pressure on profitability as they could not be fully recovered through pricing given the market environment. While we successfully reduced overheads, these savings were not enough to offset the combined impact of lower sales and cost headwinds in the period, especially sea and road freight. There are further business optimisation benefits that will materialise in the second half of the year, resulting from initiatives such as the recent restructuring of the commercial team to simplify and better align it with our simplified business model. We are also continuing our site reviews, with two freehold properties currently on the market. These efforts, amongst others, should benefit profits in the second half of the year and the\nadjusted operating margin\nof 0.7% should improve by the end of the financial year.\nFollowing the departure of the DG Americas CEO in July 2024, we have been actively recruiting a successor to accelerate and complete the division's transformation and return it to profitable revenue growth. The process is advancing well. In the interim, the US leadership team is reporting directly to Paul Bal who is visiting the US regularly. To facilitate this, other Board members and senior leaders are supporting Paul by covering some of his Group-wide responsibilities.\nAlongside the focus of developing our e-commerce capabilities, DG Americas has continued to develop and broaden its supplier base. Near-shoring efforts concentrated on Mexico continue, and we are establishing a sourcing team in India.\nDesign Group International\nDG International, which contributes over a third of the Group's revenue at $151.3 million, experienced a 6% decline in revenue compared to the prior year. This performance also reflects a continuation of the trends seen last year, with growth from key customers in continental Europe helping to offset ongoing softness in the UK and Australian markets. Whilst volume was only slightly lower, pricing came under pressure compared to last year.\nIn the UK, following an extended period of high inflation, interest rates and the cost of living crisis, consumer spending has continued to be suppressed, particularly in more discretionary product categories such as party supplies. Retailers have adopted a cautious approach to ordering, focusing on managing inventory levels amid the weaker demand. In Australia, while the economy has begun to show signs of recovery, consumer confidence remains subdued due to household debt concerns and cost pressures, leading to similarly cautious ordering patterns in non-essential categories. Continental Europe, by contrast, has remained more resilient, driven by relatively resilient consumer sentiment and supported by our strategy of winning alongside the winning retailers.\nAs a result of these regional dynamics, DG International's homeware category and activity products (within craft) performed strongly, gift packaging delivered a stable performance, while the party category experienced the most significant decline. Additionally, some orders have shifted into the second half of the year, further impacting first-half comparisons, but benefitting the second half.\nAdjusted operating profit\nfor the period was $16.9 million, down 33% from the prior year. The\nadjusted operating margin\nof 11.2% was 450 bps lower, primarily due to higher cost headwinds, particularly in freight, which more than offset raw material cost savings, and could not be fully offset through sales price recovery. Notwithstanding the tougher retail environment, our International division has made operational improvements, including restructuring shift patterns and better utilising or releasing surplus warehousing space. These initiatives have helped mitigate some of the pressures from rising costs. Additionally, as announced in June, the Board took the strategic decision to cease in-house manufacturing in China to reduce business complexity and streamline operations. The lower volumes produced through the China site in the first half resulted in lower profits compared to the prior period, but winding down the facility is expected to yield significant benefits in the second half as no further costs will be incurred with respect to the running of the site, and we therefore avoid the typical seasonality-driven losses from this period.\nLooking ahead, further improvements are anticipated in the second half of the year from the aforementioned exit of in-house manufacturing in China, as well as freight costs also turning more favourable. Therefore, although margins were compressed in the first half, we are confident that recovery will be seen by year-end as these operational efficiencies and strategic shifts such as the wider roll-out of our \"shrink-free\" SmartwrapTM innovation begin to materialise and support the strong trading performance, particularly in continental Europe.\nOur products, brands and channels\nThe Group is well-positioned to be the partner of choice for our retail customers providing a diverse, yet complementary, product portfolio. As regulatory and societal requirements become more onerous, we believe that we are best placed to reliably service an increasingly complex market place for our product categories.\nLast year, we redefined our product categories to reflect a new structure for our overall assortment, centred around two key themes: 'Celebrate' and 'Create'. This realignment is supported by our evolving organisational structures, and it allows for more strategic focus on commercial and competitive opportunities. Each of these themes is further divided into three distinct product categories, ensuring clarity and alignment within our business. This is set out in the table below:\nRevenue by product category\nHY2025\nHY2024\nGift packaging\n45%\n$178.3m\n44%\n$197.5m\nParty\n11%\n$45.4m\n13%\n$57.7m\nGoods not for resale\n7%\n$27.4m\n7%\n$30.1m\nCelebrate\n63%\n$251.1m\n64%\n$285.3m\nCraft\n17%\n$65.0m\n16%\n$70.4m\nStationery\n6%\n$22.8m\n7%\n$30.1m\nHomeware\n14%\n$54.2m\n13%\n$58.3m\nCreate\n37%\n$142.0m\n36%\n$158.8m\nTotal\n$393.1m\n$444.1m\nOn the whole, the overall mix across the six new product categories remains largely consistent with last year. Celebrate, in particular Gift packaging, continues to be the Group's leading product category comprising gift wrap, gift bags, ribbons & bows and cards. Whilst Gift packaging has declined 10% in the period, over half of this is considered phasing and is expected to recover in the second half of the year. The decline in the Party and Stationery categories reflect the underlying market conditions for more discretionary spend areas, with the former particularly impacted by the softened trading in the UK and Australia, and the latter most significantly impacted by the lower customer orders in the US. Our Craft category has remained resilient, despite being affected by the difficult US retail environment.\nRevenue by customer channel\nHY2025\nHY2024\nValue & Mass\n71%\n$280.4m\n72%\n$317.6m\nIndependents\n16%\n$61.9m\n16%\n$71.4m\nSpecialists\n10%\n$39.9m\n10%\n$46.6m\nOnline\n3%\n$10.9m\n2%\n$8.5m\nTotal\n$393.1m\n$444.1m\nThe Value & Mass channel, which represents over 70% of Group revenue, saw a decline of $37.2m in the period, largely due to a generally subdued market and lower customer ordering, though some of this reduction is anticipated to shift into the second half of the year. Despite the economic pressures, this channel demonstrated more resilience compared to the other 'brick and mortar' channels. The Specialist channel faced the steepest decline (14%), reflecting ongoing consolidation of the retail environment, especially in the US, coupled with our decision to more prudently manage US retail credit risk. Pleasingly, the Online channel revenue grew by 28% in the period, which is reflective of our strategic focus on this channel, starting with our Craft assortments.\nRevenue by season\nHY2025\nHY2024\nChristmas\n50%\n$196.4m\n50%\n$223.3m\nMinor seasons\n4%\n$17.2m\n4%\n$19.2m\nEveryday\n46%\n$179.5m\n46%\n$201.6m\nTotal\n$393.1m\n$444.1m\nIn the period there has been very little change to our seasonality, with all seasons impacted to some degree by the revenue decline. Christmas revenue decline is driven by our customers ordering more cautiously ahead of seasonal peaks reflecting weakened consumer sentiment. Everyday sales are also experiencing similar consumer sentiment challenges, however they have also been particularly impacted by our credit risk exposure management of certain US retail customers.\nRevenue by brand\nHY2025\nHY2024\nLicensed\n12%\n$47.7m\n10%\n$45.2m\nCustomer own brand / bespoke\n52%\n$205.9m\n55%\n$243.1m\nDG brand\n36%\n$139.5m\n35%\n$155.8m\nTotal\n$393.1m\n$444.1m\nLicensed sales grew in the period with pockets of growth across the Group reflecting our efforts to maintain and grow value across our overall product assortment. We have extended our relationships in this area, particularly in DG Americas, in some cases through collaborations with our larger customers. This is an area we continue to seek and explore further opportunities in. There is also increased focus on further strengthening our existing brands such as Tom Smith\u00ae.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\nThe Group's sustainability framework, \"Helping Design a Better Future,\" continues to guide our sustainability efforts across three key pillars: People, Product, and Planet. Our strategy remains focused through bringing our scale and influence to bear, especially when in collaboration with our customers. We recognise that our responsibilities extend to our employees, communities, and the environment, and we are committed to upholding the highest ethical standards whilst minimising environmental impact and driving positive change.\nOur sustainability approach is ever evolving, in the FY2024 Annual Report we continued to report progress against our key performance indicators (KPIs). While we take pride in our progress, we acknowledge that we are still in the early stages in our journey and there is always more that can be done. We will continue to develop our sustainability framework, both internally-driven, but also in collaboration with our customers' priorities and agendas in this area. Specifically, this means refining our priorities and KPIs, setting targets, and establishing goals to foster positive transformation and strive to be the most sustainable we can be. Through transparent reporting, continual improvement and, in time, introducing measurable goals, we aim to integrate sustainability seamlessly into every aspect of our operations, ensuring that our actions today lay the foundation for a better future.\nIntegrating sustainability into our business strategy not only aligns with our core values but also gives us competitive advantage and resilience. In line with our new strategy of being the partner of choice and winning together, we will refine our approach to sustainability by also looking through the lenses of our key customers. We will evaluate how our sustainability strategies align with theirs and how we can achieve our mutual sustainability goals. These insights will shape our future priorities, allowing us to better set our own aspirations and targets, whilst continuing successful collaborations with key customers.\nPeople remain central to our success, and we have furthered our investment in employee engagement, leadership, and technical development initiatives. We are proud of key achievements, such as a 10% reduction in accidents last year. During the period, we conducted our first, full and comprehensive Group-wide staff engagement survey which had a pleasingly high engagement rate of 78%. The findings from the survey are now being followed-up with further engagement and action-planning to make Design Group an even better place to work. As a further enabler for increased Group-wide collaboration and leverage, we have re-articulated the Group's purpose, vision, mission and values, and these now better align with the new growth-focused strategy, and are being embedded across the Group.\nOur product innovations have driven sustainability improvements, notably the expansion of our shrink-free Smartwrap\u2122 solution, with over half of our continental European gift wrap customers buying the solution in FY2024. And now with the rollout in DG UK progressing well, and trials underway in DG Americas, the growth is expected to continue into the future. The roll-out of Smartwrap\u2122 during the period has saved over 29 tonnes of plastic by removing the shrink film from the end consumer giftwrap packaging. These innovations align with, and help deliver, our customers' sustainability goals. During the period we have also initiated a PIMS (Product Information Management System) project to develop a Group-wide platform for capturing product information to better support traceability and provenance.\nWithin Planet, we have made progress in managing climate-related risks and reporting scope 1 and 2 emissions, while collaborating with major customers to meet their initial environmental targets ahead of schedule. This marks a significant step in our commitment to sustainability, as we work toward a more sustainable future for both the business and the planet. Further to this, during the period, we have seen solar panelling introduced in our contract manufacturing sites in Mexico which make further progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nDetailed financial review\nThe Group's financial results are summarised below, setting out both the reported and the adjusted results.\nHY2025\nHY2024\nReported\nAdjusting items\nAdjusted\nReported\nAdjusting items\nAdjusted\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\n$m\nRevenue\n393.1\n-\n393.1\n444.1\n-\n444.1\nGross profit\n65.1\n2.2\n67.3\n93.0\n0.4\n93.4\nOverheads\n(58.0)\n5.4\n(52.6)\n(55.5)\n0.3\n(55.2)\nOperating profit\n7.1\n7.6\n14.7\n37.5\n0.7\n38.2\nNet finance costs\n(1.4)\n-\n(1.4)\n(3.4)\n-\n(3.4)\nProfit before tax\n5.7\n7.6\n13.3\n34.1\n0.7\n34.8\nTax\n(1.3)\n(0.9)\n(2.2)\n(9.5)\n(0.2)\n(9.7)\nProfit after tax\n4.4\n6.7\n11.1\n24.6\n0.5\n25.1\nOperating profit\n7.1\n7.6\n14.7\n37.5\n0.7\n38.2\nDepreciation and impairment of PPE and software\n6.8\n(0.8)\n6.0\n6.9\n-\n6.9\nDepreciation and impairment of right of use assets\n7.7\n-\n7.7\n7.6\n0.6\n8.2\nAcquisition amortisation\n0.9\n(0.9)\n-\n0.9\n(0.9)\n-\nEBITDA\n22.5\n5.9\n28.4\n52.9\n0.4\n53.3\nDiluted earnings per share\n4.1c\n7.1c\n11.2c\n24.4c\n0.6c\n25.0c\nRevenue\nfor the period ended 30 September 2024 declined by 11% to $393.1\u00a0million (HY2024: $444.1\u00a0million) driven by ongoing economic challenges, subdued consumer sentiment, and careful management of credit risk exposure. Revenue at constant currency was down 12%.\nAdjusted operating profit\ndecreased 62% year-on-year to $14.7\u00a0million (HY2024: $38.2 million). The reduction in revenue as well as rising manufacturing and freight costs put pressure on profitability, and while we successfully reduced overheads, these savings were not enough to offset the combined impact of lower sales and cost headwinds in the period. Furthermore, the lower volumes produced through the China site, following the strategic decision to exit in-house manufacturing, impacted profits, but will yield benefits in the second half of the year with no further operating costs expected to be incurred with respect to the running of the site.\nAdjusted gross margin\nat 17.1% (HY2024: 21.0%) and\nadjusted operating margin\nat 3.7% (HY2024: 8.6%) are both down year\n\u2011\non-year, reflecting the increase in costs and phasing shift in profitability into the second half of the year. Similarly, the above, combined with higher adjusting items in the period, resulted in an\noperating profit\nof $7.1 million (HY2024: $37.5 million). The adjusting items of $7.6 million (HY2024: $0.7 million) are higher than the prior year, with costs being incurred in the current year to allow for the restructuring across the Group to drive business simplification. Further details of the adjusting items are detailed below.\nThe above resulted in an\nadjusted profit before tax\nof $13.3 million (HY2024: $34.8 million) and a reported\nprofit before tax\nof $5.7 million (HY2024: $34.1 million).\nAdjusted profit after tax\nwas $11.1\u00a0million (HY2024: $25.1 million) with the reported\nprofit after tax\nfor the period at $4.4 million (HY2024: $24.6 million).\nNet finance costs\nNet finance costs were lower than the prior year, being $1.4 million (HY2024: $3.4\u00a0million). The average net cash was significantly more favourable, largely due to a strong opening cash position.\nAdjusting items\nAdjusting items are material items or items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which represent gains or losses which are separately presented by virtue of their nature, size and/or incidence. The Group's adjusting items to operating profit for the six months ended 30 September 2024 include a net expense of $7.6 million (HY2024: $0.7 million) as a result of the following events:\nAdjusting items\nHY2025\nHY2024\n$m\n$m\nIntegration and restructuring (costs)/income\n(6.7)\n0.2\nAmortisation of acquired intangibles\n(0.9)\n(0.9)\nTotal\n(7.6)\n(0.7)\nIntegration and restructuring costs - $6.7 million (HY2024: $0.2 million income)\nIn order to realise synergies from acquisitions or existing businesses, integration and restructuring projects are respectively undertaken that aim to deliver future savings and efficiencies for the Group. These are projects outside of the normal operations of the business and typically incur one-time costs to ensure successful implementation. As such it is appropriate that costs associated with projects of this nature be included as adjusting items. The costs incurred in HY2025 relate to the restructuring of the DG Americas and DG UK (and its subsidiaries in Asia) businesses:\nDG Americas business reorganisation\n: In the period ended 30 September 2024 further restructuring costs, relating to staff, of $2.2 million have been recognised in DG Americas. In addition, a further $0.2 million of costs have been incurred in relation to a warehouse consolidation project.\nChina site closure\n- Following the announcement in June 2024 of the closure of Huizhou Gift International Greetings Co Ltd a subsidiary of DG UK, the business has incurred $4.3 million of restructuring costs in the period ended 30 September 2024. Of this $4.3 million, $3.0 million relates to staff costs, $0.8 million relates to asset write-downs, and $0.5m relates to other closure costs. The asset write-down resulted from assets classified as held for sale during the period being measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell at the time of reclassification.\nAmortisation of acquired intangibles - $0.9 million charge (HY2024: $0.9 million charge)\nUnder UK IFRS, as part of the acquisition of a company, it is necessary to identify intangible assets such as customer lists and trade names which form part of the intangible value of the acquired business but are not part of the acquired balance sheet. These intangible assets are then amortised to the income statement over their useful economic lives. These are not operational costs relating to the running of the acquired business and are directly related to the accounting for the acquisition. As such, we include these as adjusting items. In the current year, the amortisation relates to brands acquired as part of the acquisition of Impact Innovations Inc. (Impact).\nTaxation\nThe taxation charge for the half year on profit before tax is $1.3 million (HY2024: $9.5 million) with the effective tax rate at 23.3% (HY2024: 27.9%). The taxation charge on adjusted profit before tax is $2.2 million (HY2024: $9.7 million) with the effective tax rate at 16.2% (HY2024: 27.8%).\nThe changes in profit mix across the various territories as well as the changes across territories in the H1/H2 split are the main drivers that impact the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the UK is currently 0% as deferred tax is not recognised, and the H1/H2 profit split in this territory is the largest contributor to the low effective rate in the period.\nThe key driver behind the higher effective tax rate between adjusted and reported profit is adjusting items for which no tax relief has been attributed. These are the costs associated with the China site closure given there will be no future profits to offset these costs against and there is no tax loss carry back claim in China.\nEarnings per share\nDiluted adjusted earnings per share\nat 11.2 cents (HY2024: 25.0 cents) is reduced year-on-year driven by the decline in the underlying profit after tax for the period.\nDiluted earnings per share\nat 4.1 cents (HY2024: 24.4 cents) which is lower than adjusted diluted earnings per share reflects the adjusting items charge in the period. Further details are set out in note 9.\nDividend\nWhilst the Group remains on its path to profit and margin recovery, and given the challenging retail environment persisting in the US and some other markets, the Board is not recommending an interim dividend for the period ended 30 September 2024 (HY2024: nil).\nThe Group currently intends to provide an update to its capital allocation policy alongside the publication of the FY2025 results.\nCash flow and net cash\nThe Group ended the period with its net cash balance at $7.4\u00a0million (HY2024: $15.1\u00a0million net debt). The year\n\u2011\non\n\u2011\nyear cash balance improved as a result of a stronger opening cash position. While there were some improvements in working capital these were more than offset by lower profit levels.\nCash flow\nHY2025\nHY2024\n$m\n$m\nAdjusted EBITDA\n28.4\n53.3\nAdd back for share-based payment charge\n0.7\n0.6\nMovements in working capital\n(96.2)\n(99.5)\nAdjusted cash used by operations\n(67.1)\n(45.6)\nAdjusting items within cash used by operations\n(4.7)\n(1.8)\nCash used by operations\n(71.8)\n(47.4)\nCapital expenditure (net of disposals of property, plant and equipment)\n(3.1)\n(5.2)\nTax paid\n(3.2)\n(1.3)\nInterest paid\n(1.0)\n(2.3)\nLease liabilities principal repayments\n(8.4)\n(9.7)\nDividends paid (including those paid to non-controlling interests)\n(0.7)\n-\nFX and other\n0.4\n0.3\nMovement in net cash/(debt)\n(87.8)\n(65.6)\nOpening net cash\n95.2\n50.5\nClosing net cash/(debt)\n7.4\n(15.1)\nWorking capital\nWorking capital levels of the Group increase steadily in the first half of the year as manufacturing of seasonal product builds ahead of distribution. The second half of the year then sees the borrowing levels of the Group decline and typically move to a net cash position as Christmas-related receivables are collected. The working capital outflow in the period was $96.2 million (HY2024: $99.5 million), with a continued focus on working capital management across the Group.\nAdjusting items within cash generated from operations\nDuring the period there was a $4.7 million net cash outflow (HY2024: $1.8 million) in relation to adjusting items, in the current year these cash outflows mainly relate to the closure of the manufacturing site in China, as well as staff redundancy costs in DG Americas. In the prior year, the $1.8 million outflow mainly related to costs incurred in previous years. Further detail on adjusting items can be seen above.\nCapital expenditure\nCapital expenditure in the period was lower than the prior year at $3.1 million (HY2024: $5.2 million) with the strategic investments in the innovative Smartwrap\u2122 solution the most notable expenditure in the period. Capital expenditure in the second half of the year is expected to be higher with further investment in Smartwrap\u2122, as well as continued ERP investment, and relocation to a new warehouse facility for our DG Australia operations.\nForeign exchange exposure management\nThe Groups foreign exchange (FX) exposure is split into two areas:\nTranslational FX exposure\n- The Group's reporting currency is US dollars and the translation exposure is the result of the requirement for the Group to report its results in one currency. This necessitates the translation of our regional business units' local currency financial results into the Group's adopted reported currency. For disclosure purposes, the\u00a0constant currency amounts recalculate the prior year by using the exchange rates of the current year to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods. The overall impact on\nrevenue\nand profits from currency movements in HY2025 when compared to HY2024 is that the decrease in revenue would have been $2.9 million higher if HY2024 revenues are translated at HY2025 foreign currency exchange rates, and the decline in\nadjusted profit before tax\nwould have been $0.4\u00a0million higher.\nTransactional FX exposure\n- This FX exposure is managed carefully by the Group as it can result in additional cash outflows if not managed appropriately. In response to this risk the Group adopts an active hedging policy to ensure foreign exchange movements remain mitigated as far as possible. In addition, a reasonable proportion of this hedging is achieved through natural hedges whereby our purchases and sales in US dollars are offset. The\u00a0balance of our hedging is achieved through forward exchange contracts and similar derivatives.\nRestatement of comparative amounts\nLast year end the Group restated its prior year figures to reflect the potential liabilities relating to pre-acquisition era duties, interest, and penalties in a foreign subsidiary of the DG Americas division. The same year-end adjustments have been included as opening balance adjustments to our interim account. These estimates involved assessing historical data, interpreting relevant tax and legal regulations, and considering potential outcomes of discussions with tax authorities. Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding these liabilities, management has utilised external professional advice to ensure that the provisions are reasonable and reflect the most probable outcomes. Adjustments to these estimates may be required in future periods as new information becomes available or as circumstances change.\nRefer to note 1 for additional information.\nFinancial position and going concern basis\nThe Group's net assets increased by $24.0 million to $379.9 million at 30\u00a0September 2024 (HY2024: $355.9\u00a0million restated). The Directors have continued to pay close attention to their assessment of going concern in preparation of these financial statements. The Group is appropriately capitalised at the period end with a net cash position of $7.4 million.\nThe Directors of the Group have performed an assessment of the overall position and future forecasts for the purposes of going concern. The going concern assessment has been performed using the Group's FY2025 and FY2026 budgets and plans. These forecasts have been reviewed in detail by the Board and take into account the seasonal working capital cycle of the business. They have been sensitised to reflect severe but plausible adverse downturns in the current assumptions including the potential impact of a significant disruption in one of our major customer's business, as well as potential sales impacts from macroeconomic and subdued consumer sentiment in DG Americas, beyond those risks already factored into the budgets and plans.\nThe base forecasts and additional sensitivity analysis have been tested against the ABL facility limits and covenants. The analysis demonstrated that the Group has sufficient headroom for it to meet its obligations as they fall due for a forecast period of more than twelve months beyond the date of signing these accounts and will also be compliant with all covenants within this time frame. As such, the Directors do not see any practical regulatory or legal restrictions which would limit their ability to fund the different regions of the business as required as the Group has sufficient resources.\nAccordingly, the Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nAlternative performance measures\nThis review includes alternative performance measures (APMs) that are presented in addition to the standard UK IFRS metrics. The Directors believe that these APMs provide important additional information regarding the underlying performance of the business including trends, performance and position of the Group. APMs are used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods and segmental business units by adjusting for exceptional or uncontrollable factors which affect UK IFRS measures, to aid the understanding of the Group's performance. Consequently, APMs are used by the Directors and management for strategic and performance analysis, planning, reporting and reward setting. APMs reflect the results of the business excluding adjusting items, which are items that are material or items of an unusual or non-recurring nature.\nThe APMs and the definitions used are listed below:\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA - Profit/(loss) before finance charges, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment (EBITDA) and adjusting items\n\u00b7\nAdjusted gross profit - Gross profit before adjusting items\n\u00b7\nAdjusted operating profit/(loss) - Profit/(loss) before finance charges, tax and adjusting items\n\u00b7\nAdjusted profit/(loss) before tax - Profit/(loss) before tax and adjusting items\n\u00b7\nAdjusted profit/(loss) after tax - Profit/(loss) after tax before adjusting items and associated tax effect\n\u00b7\nAdjusted tax - Tax before adjusting items\n\u00b7\nDiluted adjusted earnings/(loss) per share - Diluted earnings/(loss) per share before adjusting items and associated tax effect\n\u00b7\nAdjusted overheads - Selling costs, administration expenses, other operating income, profit/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment (overheads) before adjusting items\n\u00b7\nAdjusted cash generated from operations - Cash generated from operations before the associated cash impact of those adjusting items\n\u00b7\nNet cash - Cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft and loan arrangement fees\nIn terms of these APMs, a full reconciliation between our adjusted and reported results is provided in the detailed financial review above, from which the following key performance metrics have been derived:\n\u00b7\nAdjusted gross margin - Adjusted gross profit divided by revenue\n\u00b7\nAdjusted operating margin - Adjusted operating profit divided by revenue\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA margin - Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue\n\u00b7\nCash conversion - Adjusted cash generated from operations divided by adjusted EBITDA\nIn addition, the Group calculates the following key performance measures, which are also APMs, using the above definitions:\n\u00b7\nReturn on capital employed - Adjusted operating profit divided by monthly average net capital employed (where capital employed is net assets excluding net cash and intangible assets)\n\u00b7\nAverage leverage - Average bank debt (being average debt measured before lease liabilities) divided by adjusted EBITDA reduced for lease payments\nFurther details of the items categorised as adjusting items are disclosed in more detail in note 3.\nRisk\nThe Group operates a decentralised model where the risk management framework is well-established, with a bottom-up approach starting within each business unit and the Group team and Board playing an overarching role to ensure oversight. This allows for risks to be managed within the Board's tolerance and appetite levels, as well as ensuring risk management is embedded within strategic and operational decision making. The risk management framework, along with the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, remain in line with those set out on pages 64 to 69 of our annual report and financial statements 2024.\nThe key risks for the Group at present continue to be: Macroeconomic uncertainty and Strategy. Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to be high following the succession of geopolitical events impacting our business across our suppliers, customers, consumers and workforce. The outlook is also set to remain uncertain in the immediate future, which is also impacting consumers with a high inflationary environment and subdued sentiment. We therefore need to able to respond appropriately to external market conditions whilst maintaining a clear focus on delivering our strategy, focusing on winning with the winning retailers. Given the journey we are on to address the Group strategy, this risk remains crucial ensure sustainable profit growth is achieved.\nStatement of Directors' responsibilities\nThe Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge that these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information, namely:\n\u00b7\nan indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n\u00b7\nmaterial related-party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related-party transactions described in the last annual report.\nBy order of the Board\nRohan Cummings\nDirector\n25 November 2024\nCONDENSED

Accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe condensed financial information contained in this interim report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 435 of the Companies Act\u00a02006 and is unaudited. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2024 were approved by the board of directors on 24 June 2024 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. These interim financial statements have been reviewed, not audited.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 September 2024 has been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. The interim report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2024, which has been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and any public announcements made by IG Design Group plc during the interim reporting period.\nThe preparation of financial statements that conform with adopted UK IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if relevant.\nFor the purposes of these financial statements, 'Design Group' or 'the Group' means IG Design Group plc ('the Company') and its subsidiaries. IG Design plc is a company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the UK. Its registered office is Howard House, Howard Way, Interchange Park, Newport Pagnell, MK16 9PX. Its shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).\nSeasonality of the business\nThe business of the Group is seasonal and although revenues generally accrue relatively evenly in both halves of the year, working capital requirements, including inventory levels, increase steadily in the first half from July and peak in October as manufacturing of Christmas products builds ahead of distribution. The second half of the year sees the borrowing of the Group decline and move to typically a cash positive position as the Group collects its receivables through January to March.\nRestatement of comparative amounts\nThe Group has restated its prior year figures to reflect the potential liabilities relating to pre-acquisition era duties, interest, and penalties in a foreign subsidiary of the DG Americas division. This adjustment has resulted in a restatement of goodwill, as the initial acquisition accounting did not include a provision in relation to this potential liability. Consequently, the 30 September 2023 balance sheet has been adjusted by $5.8 million to restate the goodwill (included with in intangible assets) at acquisition and a provision of $5.5 million (included within current liabilities) has been raised. In addition, the post-acquisition impact on retained earnings of $456,000 and on translation reserve of $802,000 have been adjusted in the statement of changes in equity accordingly.\nPresentation currency\nThe presentation and functional currency of the Group is US dollars. The functional currency of the Parent Company remains as pound sterling as it is located in the United Kingdom and substantially all of its cash flows, assets and liabilities are denominated in pound sterling, as well as its share capital.\nGoing concern\nInformation regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the detailed financial review above. Cash balances and borrowings are detailed in notes 7 and 8.\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue trading for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements, based on an assessment of the overall position and future forecasts for the going concern period. This assessment has also considered the overall level of Group borrowings and covenant requirements, the flexibility of the Group to react to changing market conditions and ability to appropriately manage any business risks.\nOn 5 June 2023, the business entered into a new banking facility with HSBC and NatWest bank as part of a three-year deal to meet the funding requirements of the Group. This facility comprises an Asset Backed Lending (ABL) arrangement with a maximum facility amount of $125.0 million. On 3 November 2023 the Group made an operational amendment to the ABL arrangement and signed a supplemental agreement to convert and increase the overdraft to a \u00a317.0 million RCF facility between 17 June 2024 and 16 August 2024. This amendment offered flexibility during the months where the Group may have had a requirement for funding while having limited access into the ABL. Cash balances, borrowing and the financial covenants applicable to the facility are detailed in notes 7 and 8.\nIn addition to the above facility, the Group also increased its unsecured overdraft facility provided by HSBC to \u00a316.5 million, which reduced to \u00a38.5 million from August 2023. As such, after making appropriate enquires, the Directors do not see any practical, regulatory or legal restrictions which would limit their ability to fund the different regions of the business as required as the Group has sufficient resources.\nThe Group also has access to supplier financing arrangements from certain customers which we utilise at certain times of the year. The largest of these supplier financing arrangements are subject to the continuing support of the customers' banking partners and therefore could be withdrawn at short notice. As the new ABL arrangement is linked to trade debtors, any withdrawal of these facilities would be largely offset as the borrowing base under the facility would increase.\nThe Directors have assessed detailed plans and forecasts up to 31 March 2026. These forecasts reflect the fact that the Group has returned to profitability and continues to grow profitability and margins as a result. They also reflect the seasonal operating cycle of the business and further stabilisation associated with the DG Americas plan, following the decline in performance in the first half of the year.\nThese forecasts have been sensitised to reflect severe but plausible adverse downturns in the current assumptions. Specifically, the severe but plausible downside scenario has taken account of the following risks:\n\u00b7\nthe potential impact of a significant disruption in one of our major customer's business, reflected in a c$10 million reduction in sales performance and related cash and working capital impacts; and\n\u00b7\nthe potential of further impacts resulting from the macroeconomic environment and subdued consumer sentiment in DG Americas, reflected in a c$40 million reduction in sales and with associated effects on facility headroom.\nIn the severe but plausible scenario modelled, there remains sufficient headroom in our forecast liquidity, and sufficient headroom under the covenant requirements.\nBased on this assessment, the Directors have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim report are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period and the adoption of new and amended standards. A number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\n2. Segmental information\nThe Group has one material business activity, being the design, manufacture and distribution of various celebration and creative products.\nThe business operates under two reporting segments which are reported to, and evaluated by, the Chief Operating Decision Makers for the Group. The DG Americas segment includes overseas operations in Asia, Australia, the UK, India and Mexico, being the overseas entities of US companies. The DG International segment comprises the consolidation of the separately owned business in the UK, Asia, Europe and Australia.\nInter\n\u2011\nsegment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.\nFinancial performance of each segment is measured on adjusted operating profit before management recharges. Interest and tax are managed on a Group basis and not split between reportable segments. However, the related financial liabilities and cash have been allocated out into the reportable segments as this is how they are managed by the Group.\nSegment assets are all non-current and current assets, excluding deferred tax and income tax, which are shown in the eliminations column. Inter\n\u2011\nsegment receivables and payables are not included within segmental assets and liabilities as they eliminate on consolidation.\nDG\nCentral &\nDG Americas(a)\nInternational\neliminations\nGroup\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nSix months ended 30 September 2024\nRevenue - external\n241,765\n151,304\n-\n393,069\n- inter-segment\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n241,765\n151,304\n-\n393,069\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n1,654\n16,928\n(3,922)\n14,660\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n(3,270)\n(4,341)\n-\n(7,611)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n(1,616)\n12,587\n(3,922)\n7,049\nFinance income\n605\nFinance costs\n(1,958)\nIncome tax\n(1,328)\nProfit for the six months ended 30 September 2024\n4,368\nBalances at 30 September 2024\nSegment assets\n411,186\n244,920\n69,147\n725,253\nSegment liabilities\n(199,201)\n(135,263)\n(10,862)\n(345,326)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n1,349\n1,855\n5\n3,209\n- intangible assets\n-\n6\n-\n6\n- right-of-use assets\n2,228\n292\n-\n2,520\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n3,207\n3,253\n13\n6,473\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n1,190\n41\n-\n1,231\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n5,273\n2,412\n4\n7,689\n(Loss)/profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n(258)\n12\n-\n(246)\n(a) Including overseas entities for the DG Americas operating segment.\nDG\nCentral &\nDG Americas(a)\nInternational\neliminations\nGroup\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nSix months ended 30 September 2023\nRevenue - external\n282,392\n161,658\n-\n444,050\n- inter-segment\n-\n33\n(33)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n282,392\n161,691\n(33)\n444,050\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n16,568\n25,315\n(3,640)\n38,243\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n(742)\n-\n-\n(742)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n15,826\n25,315\n(3,640)\n37,501\nFinance income\n235\nFinance costs\n(3,683)\nIncome tax\n(9,485)\nProfit for the six months ended 30 September 2023\n24,568\nBalances at 30 September 2023\nSegment assets (restated)(b)\n474,630\n249,221\n44,836\n768,687\nSegment liabilities (restated)(b)\n(246,665)\n(137,278)\n(28,808)\n(412,751)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n3,659\n1,418\n46\n5,123\n- intangible assets\n59\n34\n-\n93\n- right-of-use assets\n1,207\n144\n-\n1,351\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n3,483\n2,664\n12\n6,159\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n1,533\n70\n-\n1,603\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n5,691\n2,484\n4\n8,179\nReversal of impairment - right-of-use assets\n(553)\n-\n-\n(553)\nProfit on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n-\n24\n-\n24\n(a) Including overseas entities for the DG Americas operating segment.\n(b) Restated - see note 1 for further details.\nDG\nCentral &\nDG Americas(a)\nInternational\neliminations\nGroup\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nYear ended 31 March 2024\nRevenue - external\n500,310\n299,741\n-\n800,051\n- inter-segment\n-\n33\n(33)\n-\nTotal segment revenue\n500,310\n299,774\n(33)\n800,051\nSegment profit/(loss) before adjusting items\n6,768\n32,257\n(7,927)\n31,098\nAdjusting items (note 3)\n(1,892)\n(210)\n-\n(2,102)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n4,876\n32,047\n(7,927)\n28,996\nFinance income\n1,065\nFinance costs\n(6,219)\nIncome tax\n13,277\nLoss for the year ended 31 March 2024\n37,119\nBalances at 31 March 2024\nSegment assets\n353,706\n194,348\n113,289\n661,343\nSegment liabilities\n(138,722)\n(78,443)\n(74,691)\n(291,856)\nCapital expenditure additions\n- property, plant and equipment\n5,483\n6,327\n53\n11,863\n- property, plant and equipment on acquisition of business\n-\n84\n-\n84\n- intangible assets\n390\n52\n-\n442\n- intangible assets on acquisition of business\n-\n278\n-\n278\n- right-of-use assets\n4,389\n2,224\n-\n6,613\nDepreciation - property, plant and equipment\n6,776\n5,526\n24\n12,326\nAmortisation - intangible assets\n2,897\n135\n-\n3,032\nDepreciation - right-of-use assets\n11,525\n4,938\n7\n16,470\nReversal of impairment - right-of-use assets\n(553)\n-\n-\n(553)\n(Loss)/profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n(279)\n41\n-\n(238)\n(a) Including overseas entities for the DG Americas operating segment.\nTotal administration expenses are $37.4 million (HY2024: $33.9 million; FY2024: $70.0 million), which includes $0.8 million (HY2024: nil, FY2024: nil) loss on re-measurement of assets held for sale (see note 3 for further details).\n3.

These\u00a0items are material items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which represent gains or losses and are presented to allow for the review of the performance of the business in a consistent manner and in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis and allow the reader to obtain a clearer understanding of the underlying results of the ongoing Group's operations. They are typically gains or costs associated with events that are not considered to form part of the core operations, or are considered to be a 'non-recurring' event (although they may span several accounting periods).\nThese (gains)/losses are broken down as follows:\n(1) Acquisition integration and restructuring costs - $6.7 million (HY2024: $0.2 million income)\nIn order to realise synergies from acquisitions, or existing businesses, integration and restructuring projects are respectively undertaken that aim to deliver future savings and efficiencies for the Group. These are projects outside of the normal operations of the business and typically incur one-time costs to ensure successful implementation. As such it is appropriate that costs associated with projects of this nature be included as adjusting items. The costs incurred in HY2025 relate to the restructuring of DG Americas and DG UK (and its subsidiary in Asia) businesses:\nDG Americas business reorganisation\n- $2.4 million (HY2024: $0.4 million): In the period ended 30 September 2024 further restructuring costs, relating to staff, of $2.2 million have been recognised in DG Americas. In addition, a further $0.2 million of costs have been incurred in relation to a warehouse consolidation project, effecting warehouses in South Centre and Hagerstown. (HY2024: $0.4 million).\nChina site closure\n- $4.3 million (HY2024: $nil): Following the announcement in June 2024 of the closure of Huizhou Gift International Greetings Co Ltd a subsidiary of DG UK, the business has incurred $4.3 million of restructuring costs in the period ended 30 September 2024. Of this $4.3 million, $3.0 million relates to staff costs, $0.8 million relates to asset write-downs, and $0.5m relates to other closure costs. The asset write-down resulted from assets classified as held for sale during the period being measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell at the time of reclassification. This is a level 2 measurement as per the fair value hierarchy set out in note 10. These are not considered operational costs relating to the running of the business and are directly related to the accounting for the closure.\nReversal of impairment\n- $nil (HY2024: $0.6 million credit: Following the integration of DG Americas' sites in FY2021, a portion of a leased site in Budd Lake, New Jersey was exited, and the right-of-use asset was impaired. In the period ended 31 March 2024, the landlord reacquired a portion of the impaired site resulting in a reversal of impairment in HY2024 of $0.6 million.\n(2) Amortisation of acquired intangibles - $0.9 million charge (HY2024 $0.9 million)\nUnder IFRS, as part of the acquisition of a company, it is necessary to identify intangible assets such as customer lists and brands which form part of the intangible value of the acquired business, but which are not part of the acquired balance sheet. These intangible assets are then amortised to the income statement over their useful economic lives. These are not considered operational costs relating to the running of the acquired business and are directly related to the accounting for the acquisition. These include brands acquired as part of the acquisition of Impact Innovations Inc.\nThe cash flow effect of adjusting items\nThere was a $4.7 million net outflow in the current period's cash flow (HY2024: $1.8 million, FY2024: $2.1 million) relating to adjusting items which included $249,000 outflow (HY2023: $1.4 million, FY2024: $1.5 million) deferred from prior years.\n4.

The 2024-2027 LTIP scheme is subject to certain performance criteria being achieved during a three-year period: relative Total Shareholder Return versus FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) constituents; and EPS growth, with an 'underpin' condition to reduce vesting levels if unwarranted 'windfall gains' from share price movements arise. There is a two-year holding period for certain individuals.\n5.

The income tax expense is recognised based on management's estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. The estimated average annual tax rate used for the period to 30 September 2024 was 23.3% (HY2024: 27.9%). The changes in profit mix across the various territories as well as the changes across territories in the H1/H2 split are the main drivers that impact the effective tax rate. The tax effect of adjusting items are recognised in the same period as the relevant adjusting item.\nThe deferred tax assets in the UK continue not to be recognised based on the assessment of future taxable profits against which the asset could unwind.\nOECD Pillar Two\nOn 20 June 2023, the Finance (No.2) Act 2023 was enacted in the UK, including legislation to implement the OECD Pillar Two\nincome taxes and will come into effect from 1 April 2024. This UK legislation includes an income inclusion rule, which is designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each country in which the Group operates (Pillar Two income taxes). Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. The Group is within the scope of this legislation. The Group has applied the mandatory temporary exception in the Amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023 and endorsed in July 2023, and has not recognised or disclosed information about deferred tax assets or liabilities relating to Pillar Two income taxes.\nBased on an assessment of the data for the year ended 31 March 2023 undertaken at 31 March 2024 year end, the Group has a qualifying Country by Country report (CbCR) and all territories have passed the transitional safe harbours. The Group also expects to have qualifying CbCR reports for the subsequent years for which the transitional safe harbours are available and therefore has the opportunity for each year to potentially meet the transitional safe harbours. Based on an initial assessment of the provisional data for the year ended 31 March 2024, as well as the forecast data, we do not expect the impact of Pillar Two income taxes to be material for the year ended 31 March 2025 and therefore has not been included in the ETR calculation for the period ended 30 September 2024.\n7.

The facility with HSBC and NatWest banks has a term of three years. On 3 November 2023 the Group made an operational amendment to the ABL arrangement and signed a supplemental agreement to convert and increase the overdraft to a \u00a317.0 million RCF facility between 17 June 2024 and 16 August 2024. This amendment did not increase the maximum facility amount and offered flexibility during the months where the Group had a requirement for funding while having limited access into the ABL.\nThe Group also increased its unsecured overdraft facility provided by HSBC to \u00a316.5 million, which reduced to \u00a38.5 million from August 2023.\nInterest charged on the Asset Backed lending facility is based, on one of two methods dependant on the duration of the Group's borrowing request submission:\n\u00b7\na margin of between 1.75% and 2.25%, based on average excess availability, plus a 0.1% credit spread adjustment, plus the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"); or\n\u00b7\na margin of between 0.75% and 1.25% based on average excess availability, plus a rate based on the higher of: the HSBC prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or SOFR plus 1%.\nA further commitment/non-utilisation fee is charged at 0.25% where facility usage is greater than 50% of the maximum credit line and 0.375% where facility usage is less than 50% of the maximum credit line.\nInterest on the RCF would have been charged at a margin of 2.5% plus Sterling Overnight Index Average (\"SONIA\").\nThe financial covenant within the ABL agreement, which is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 times, is only triggered if the remaining availability of the facility is less than the higher of $12.5 million or 12.5% of the borrowing base. The amendment to the facility on 3 November 2023, reduced the remaining availability trigger point to $6.5 million over the two month period.\nThe financial covenants within the RCF agreement were as follows:\n\u00b7\na minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 times, calculated for the 12 month period to the most recent quarterly reporting period; and\n\u00b7\nan asset cover ratio of no less than 200% calculated as at the date of the last monthly reporting period.\nThe ABL (and RCF for the period it was in operation) is secured with an all-assets lien on all existing and future assets of the loan parties. The loan parties are Anker Play Products, LLC, Berwick Offray, LLC, BOC Distribution, Inc., C. R. Gibson, LLC, CSS Industries, Inc., IG Design Group (Lang), Inc., IG Design Group Americas, Inc., IG Design Group plc, IG Design Group UK Limited, Impact Innovations, Inc., Lion Ribbon Company, LLC, Paper Magic Group, Inc., Philadelphia Industries, Inc., Simplicity Creative Corp., The Lang Companies, Inc., The McCall Pattern Company, Inc.\nInvoice financing arrangements are secured over the trade receivables that they are drawn on.\nLoan arrangement fees represent the unamortised costs in arranging the Group facilities. These fees are being amortised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the facilities.\nThe Group is party to supplier financing arrangements with a number of its key customers and the associated balances are recognised as trade receivables until receipt of the payment from the bank, at which point the receivable is derecognised.\n9.

Financial instruments\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts is assessed using valuation models taking into account market inputs such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves and forward interest rates.\nFair value hierarchy\nFinancial instruments and certain assets held for sale have been recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. The three levels are defined as follows:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u00b7\nLevel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either\u00a0directly or indirectly; and\n\u00b7\nLevel 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.\nAll other financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\nThe Group held the following financial instruments at 30 September 2024, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition:\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nTwelve\nsix months\nsix months\nmonths\nended\nended\nended\n30 Sep 2024\n30 Sep 2023\n31 Mar 2024\nForward exchange contracts carrying amount\n$000\n$000\n$000\nDerivative financial assets\n403\n664\n68\nDerivative financial liabilities\n(319)\n(876)\n(26)\nThe Group has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 30 September 2024 designated as hedges of expected future purchases in US dollars for which the Group has firm commitments, as the derivatives are based on forecasts and an economic relationship exists at the time the derivative contracts are taken out. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.\nThe Group had assets held for sale at 30 September 2024 of $855,000 (HY2024 $nil), which were measured at Level 2 fair value.\n11. Capital commitments\nAt 30 September 2024, the Group had outstanding authorised capital commitments to purchase plant and equipment for $4.9 million (HY2024: $4.0 million). At 30 September 2024, the Group has estimated lease commitments for leases not yet commenced of $18.6 million (HY2024: $16.7 million).\n12.

Non-adjusting post balance sheet events\nThere were no known material non-adjusting events which occurred between the end of the reporting period and prior to the authorisation of this interim report.\nIndependent review report to IG Design Group plc\nReport on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements\nOur conclusion\nWe have reviewed IG Design Group plc's condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the \"interim financial statements\") for the 6 month period ended 30 September 2024 (the \"period\").\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the AIM Rules for Companies.\nThe interim financial statements comprise:\n\u2022\nthe Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 September 2024;\n\u2022\nthe Condensed Consolidated Income Statement and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period then ended;\n\u2022\nthe Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the period then ended;\n\u2022\nthe Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the period then ended; and\n\u2022\nthe explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the AIM Rules for Companies.\nBasis for conclusion\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (\"ISRE (UK) 2410\"). A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.\nA review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.\nResponsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review\nOur responsibilities and those of the directors\nThe interim financial statements are the responsibility of, and have been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the interim financial statements in accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies which require that the financial information must be presented and prepared in a form consistent with that which will be adopted in the company's annual financial statements. In preparing the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the AIM Rules for Companies and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChartered Accountants\nMilton Keynes\n25 November 2024\nREGISTERED OFFICE\nHoward HouseHoward WayInterchange ParkNewport Pagnell MK16 9PX\nIG Design Group plcis registered inEngland and Wales,number 1401155\nVisit us online at\nthedesigngroup.com\nADVISERS\nFinancial and nominatedadviser and broker\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n88 Wood StreetLondon EC2V 7QR\nIndependent auditors\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nExchange House\nCentral Business Exchange\nMidsummer Boulevard\nCentral Milton Keynes\nMK9 2DF\nPublic relations\nAlma Strategic Communications\n71-73 Carter LaneLondon EC4V 5EQ\nShare registrar\nLink Group\nCentral Square29 Wellington StreetLeeds LS1 4DL\nBy phone:UK - 0371 664 0300\nCalls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider.

These initiatives have resulted in significant growth in profit and margin for the year. The Group expects to deliver adjusted profit before tax of $25.9m (FY23: $9.2m), which is ahead of market expectations. The Group's adjusted operating profit margin is expected to be c3.8% which is a further recovery of 200 bps on the previous year.\nThe Group expects to deliver revenue for the year in line with expectations of c$800 million. This is a 10% reduction year-on-year and is split between the Group's divisions as follows:\n-\nThe DG Americas division experienced a decline of c16%. This was mainly in the first half of the year which was down 24% due to lower volume across a number of categories. Pleasingly during the second half of the year, revenue stabilised and was down c1%.\n-\nThe DG International division was in line with prior year on a reported currency basis. Softness in the UK and Australia markets was more than offset by continued momentum across continental Europe.\nFinancial position\nThe Group closed the year with a net cash balance of $95 million (FY23: $50m), a $45m year-on-year increase which is well ahead of market expectation. The Group was average cash positive for the year despite its traditional seasonal cycle of working capital movements. This improved cash position was driven by increased profitability and continued improvements in working capital management throughout the Group.\nMoving forward, the cash position of the Group is expected to continue strengthening due to its financial performance and sale of freehold sites following footprint consolidation in the DG Americas division.\nThe Group expects to make a provision of c$5.5m* for potential liabilities relating to pre-acquisition era duties owed in the DG Americas division and is taking legal advice on the matter. Due to the historic nature of this issue, the results for the year ended 31 March 2024 will be adjusted accordingly.\n* Subject to further legal review\nOutlook\nThe financial performance delivered in the year has been ahead of expectations and reflects the Board's aspiration to return to pre-Covid adjusted operating profit margins of 4.5% by 31 March 2025.\nThe increase in profitability came from both divisions, with the DG Americas division growing 132% (c$4m) and DG International growing 61% (c$12m). Whilst the Board expects momentum to continue into the year ahead; more of the profit growth should come from the DG Americas division. Management initiatives to underpin this track in line with expectations.\nThe Board is pleased with the operational progress and financial performance of the Group. As highlighted in our interim results, there remains caution in consumer shopping behaviour which holds down demand in certain markets and product categories. That said, actions taken over the past two years provide confidence in the delivery of the expectations for the year ahead, with the Group on track to deliver on its margin target for 31 March 2025.\nPaul Bal, CEO, commented:\n\"I am delighted with our progress in improving operational efficiency and simplifying our business. Through our work, we have delivered another year with significant improvement in profit and margin.
