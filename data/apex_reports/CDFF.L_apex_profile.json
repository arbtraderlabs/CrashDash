The total portfolio including the jointly controlled Campmoss investment and development portfolio, valued in excess of \u00a322m, is primarily located to the west of London, close to Heathrow Airport and in Surrey and Berkshire.)\nPRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nHighlights:\n2025\n2024\nNet Assets\n\u00a3'000\n30,664\n30,423\nNet Assets Per Share\n\u00a3\n30.53\n29.31\nProfit Before Tax\n\u00a3'000\n1,679\n1,385\nEarnings Per Share - Basic and diluted\npence\n132.90\n102.75\nDividend Per Share\npence\n27.5\n23.5\nGearing\n%\nNil\nNil\nRichard Wollenberg, Chairman, commented:\n\"\nThe Thames Valley commercial and residential property market has remained quiet over the year.

Until investors see consistent signs of stability and credible growth prospects the market will remain subdued.\nWhilst I can report new lettings to the Group's portfolio confidence in the property market is at a low ebb as investors continue to be buffeted by ongoing concerns over the economic trajectory for the UK.\nThe Group, including Campmoss Property, our 47.62% owned Joint Venture partner, has made good progress in respect of planning permissions details of which appear later in this report.\nA number of office rental and residential lettings have been achieved throughout the Group's portfolio with minor increases in rental. The majority of lease expiries resulted in new leases being agreed with existing tenants for terms in the range of 3-5 years usually with an RPI increase. The Campmoss Group's residential apartments in Bracknell are let on annual agreements and again minor increases in line with RPI have been achieved.\nFINANCIAL\nFor the year to 30 September 2025 the Group profit before tax was \u00a31.7m (2024: \u00a31.4m). This includes a minor decrease in Company property values of \u00a30.005m (2024: \u00a30.02m). Our share of profit after tax in Campmoss and its subsidiary which, in accordance with IAS 40, includes an increase in property values of \u00a30.21m amounted to \u00a30.38m (2024: \u00a30.14m).\nFor the year ended 30 September 2025, the Company received a dividend of \u00a32.5m. from its investment in Campmoss.\nRevenue for the year which represented gross rental income, excluding Campmoss, totalled \u00a30.7m (2024: \u00a30.7m).\nThe profit after tax attributable to shareholders for the financial year was \u00a31.36m (2024: \u00a31.07m) and the earnings per share was 132.90p (2024: 102.76p).\nAt the year-end, the Company's commercial portfolio was valued by Kempton Carr Croft at a total of \u00a35.64m (2024: \u00a35.63m). This valuation excludes the company's freehold office property which was also valued by Kempton Carr Croft and is included in the balance sheet at valuation and classified as property, plant and equipment.\nProperty when completed and retained for re-sale is held as inventory at the lower of cost or net realisable value. At the year-end this related to commercial property at The Windsor Business Centre owned by First Choice Estates plc, the Company's fully owned subsidiary and residential apartments held by Campmoss Developments Limited.\nThe Group's total property portfolio, including the jointly controlled Campmoss group, was valued at \u00a323.4m (2024: \u00a322.9m).\nThe Company's share of the net assets of Campmoss group was \u00a39.30m (2024: \u00a311.42m). The reduction in value is due to dividends received from Campmoss of \u00a32.5m (2024: \u00a31.0m)\nThe Group's total net assets as at the year-end were \u00a330.66m (2024: \u00a330.42m) equivalent to \u00a330.53 per share (2024: \u00a329.31) an increase of 4.1% over the year (2024: 3.1%). The Group, including Campmoss, has adequate financial facilities and resources to complete works in progress. Cash balances are held on instant or short-term deposit. At the year-end, the Company had nil gearing (2024: nil).\nDuring the year the Company purchased and cancelled 33,356 (2024: 16,034) ordinary shares at a total cost of \u00a30.85m (2024: \u00a30.37m).\nThe Company may hold in treasury any of its own shares purchased. This gives the Company the ability to reissue treasury shares and provides great flexibility in the management of its capital base. At the year end the Company held nil (2024: nil) shares in treasury. Any shares purchased by the Company not held in treasury will be cancelled and the number of shares in\nissue reduced accordingly.\nThe Company proposes to continue its policy of purchasing its own shares, whether to be held in treasury or to be cancelled, and a resolution renewing the directors' authority will be placed before the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held on 15 January 2026. This authority will only be exercised in circumstances where the directors regard such purchases to be in the best interests of shareholders as a whole. Full details of the AGM is available on the Company's website\nwww.cardiff-property.com\n.\nIFRS accounting requires that deferred tax is recognised on the difference between the cost of properties including applicable indexation and quoted investments and their current market value. However, IFRS accounting does not require the same treatment in respect of the Group's unquoted investment in Campmoss, which represents a substantial part of the Company's net assets. Whilst provision is made in the Campmoss accounts for deferred tax should Cardiff dispose of its shareholding in Campmoss, for indicative purposes only and based on the value in the Company's balance sheet at the year-end this would result in a tax liability of \u00a32.33m (2024 : \u00a32.86m) equivalent \u00a32.26 (2024: \u00a32.75) per share calculated using a tax rate of 25% (2024: 25%). This information is provided to shareholders as an additional non-statutory disclosure.\nDIVIDEND\nThe directors recommend a final dividend of 20.0p per share (2024: 17.0p) making a total dividend for the year of 27.5p (2024: 23.5p), an increase of 17.0%. The final dividend will be paid on 30 January 2026 to shareholders on the register at 16 January 2026.\nTHE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO\nThe Group continues to manage its property portfolio located in the Thames Valley and the surrounding counties of Surrey, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire close to Heathrow Airport.\nDuring the year the Company achieved new lettings at The Windsor Business Centre, Windsor, (following refurbishment and lease expiry) at the White House, Egham (1st floor office and ground floor retail unit) and at Maidenhead Enterprise Centre, Maidenhead (ground floor warehouse). In the Campmoss portfolio one retail unit remains available (now under offer) at Market Street, Bracknell.\nAt The Priory, Burnham, Campmoss was recently granted a further planning approval for a 75 bedroom care home which now allows the building to be separated from the existing Grade II Listed office building known as The Business Centre. On 10 October, after the year end, contracts were exchanged with a developer and operator to dispose of the Property. Further details are given at the end of this report under \"Post Balance Sheet Events\"\nAt Highway House, Maidenhead, planning for a 76 apartment residential scheme including affordable housing was granted subject to a Section 106 agreement which has now been completed. A Care Home scheme was refused although an appeal is being considered.\nAt Tangley Place, Worplesdon, an application for a 64 bedroom Care Home has been lodged and discussions with the Local Authority are in progress.\nAs pointed out in previous years the cost of planning applications including a multitude of associated reports, has risen substantially. It should be noted that the above planning applications have taken upwards of 2 years to progress. Governments have continually stated that this process will be simplified but to date no changes have been evident.\nThe Group's portfolio including stock and Campmoss covers 43% retail, 6% business units, 13% residential and 38% office/care home.\nFOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (\"ESG\")\nThe Group has a strategy of providing environmentally sustainable, energy efficient and functionable buildings consistent with physical and financial constraints. Close liaison with its tenants remains an important policy.\nDuring the year no re-development has been undertaken whilst refurbishment projects have given consideration towards ESG as well as related Health and Safety issues.\nOur planning applications emphasise sustainability and modern design as well as green policies and being energy efficient. Our aim is to create a good working environment and achieve a BREEAM rating of Very Good.\nWe continue to take appropriate action where necessary to reduce carbon emissions and the impact on the environment. We view our properties as both contributing to the local economy and providing householders with decent living facilities.\nQUOTED INVESTMENTS\nThe Company retains a small portfolio of short-term retail bonds and equity investments. The value has marginally decreased over the year with the former providing a steady income stream.\nThe equity investments include Aquila Services Group plc (the UK's largest affordable housing consultancy group) and Galileo Resources plc (a mining exploration company with assets primarily in Zambia). I remain a non-executive director of both companies.\nMANAGEMENT AND TEAM\nThe property market continues to require intensive and challenging management and I would therefore take this opportunity to thank all members of our small property team and our Joint Venture partner for their support, enthusiasm and achievements over the year.\nOUTLOOK\nAs I write this report the investment community will be assessing the effects of the recent budget statement. This will inevitably take time as the business community and investors evaluate and form their own conclusions. The prospect of any further major decreases in interest rates appears to now be placed on hold.\nPOST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\nAs detailed earlier at The Priory, Burnham planning permission was granted in early October for a Care Home. Subsequently Campmoss has exchanged a conditional contract for the freehold sale. I anticipate that the conditions will be met over the next 4-6 months.\nThe year ahead will have its challenges and I look forward to reporting further at the half year.\nJ.

Basis of preparation\nThe consolidated results for the year ended 30 September 2025 and 2024 are prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (\"UK-adopted IAS\") and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and have been incorporated into the principal accounting policies.\nThe financial information set out above does not constitute the company's statutory financial statements for the years ended 30 September 2025 or 30 September 2024 but is derived from those financial statements. Statutory financial statements for 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2025 will be delivered in due course. The auditor has reported on those financial statements; their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of the financial statements for 2025 nor 2024.\nGoing concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group's activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chairman's Statement and Strategic Report. The financial position of the Group, its property portfolio under management, asset base, liquidity and key performance indicators.\nThe Group has sufficient financial resources to enable it to continue to trade and to complete the current maintenance and development programme. The Group is ungeared, and the cash flow forecasts do not assume any debt being required. Therefore, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.\nThe Group has significant cash balances at 30 September 2025, the Cardiff Group had cash balances of \u00a310.5m and a further \u00a34.0m term deposits (with maturity dates of 95 days), in addition the Company has investments of \u00a30.5m of which \u00a30.4m are readily marketable. The Group has an operating cost base including tax and dividends of under \u00a31.0m per annum so even with no income for several years the Group would remain solvent. The impact of external environment factors including inflation and unemployment is therefore not critical to the going concern position of the Group or Company.\nThe Cardiff Group receives a management fee from Campmoss of around \u00a30.5m per annum, there is no reason to assume this income would not be received as the Campmoss Group had cash balances at 30 September 2025, of \u00a33.7m and a further \u00a31.0m term deposits (with maturity dates of 95 days). Campmoss have an annual operating cost base excluding development but including the Cardiff management fee of under \u00a31.5m, so Campmoss Group similarly has a strong balance sheet.\nNew, revised or changes to existing financial reporting standards\nSubject to the adoption of the IFRS's available for application noted below, this announcement is prepared on the basis of the accounting policies as set out in the most recently published set of annual financial statements.\nIFRS\nA number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective for the current accounting period. None are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n(continued)\n2. Segmental analysis\nThe Group manages its operations in two segments, being property and other investment and property development. Property and other investment relates to the results for The Cardiff Property Company Limited where properties are held as investment property with Property Development relating to the results of First Choice Estates Plc and Thames Valley Retirement Homes Limited. The results of these segments are regularly reviewed by the Board as a basis for the allocation of resources, in conjunction with individual site investment appraisals, and to assess their performance. Information regarding the results and net operating assets for each reportable segment are set out below:\nProperty and other investment\nProperty Development\nEliminations\n2025Total\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRental income (wholly in the UK)\n493\n187\n-\n680\nFinancial income\n684\n1\n-\n685\nShare of profit of Joint Venture\n306\n74\n-\n380\nProfit before taxation\n1,482\n197\n-\n1,679\nNet operating assets\nAssets\n30,826\n5,475\n(4,586)\n31,715\nLiabilities\n(5,431)\n(206)\n4,586\n(1,051)\nNet assets\n25,395\n5,269\n-\n30,664\nProperty and other investment\nProperty Development\nEliminations\n2024Total\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRental income (wholly in the UK)\n460\n223\n-\n683\nProperty sales\nFinancial income\n602\n6\n-\n608\nShare of profit of Joint Venture\n62\n78\n-\n140\nProfit before taxation\n1,073\n312\n-\n1,385\nNet operating assets\nAssets\n30,504\n5,388\n(4,465)\n31,427\nLiabilities\n(5,259)\n(210)\n4,465\n(1,004)\nNet assets\n25,245\n5,178\n-\n30,423\n\"Eliminations\" relate to inter segment transactions and balances which cannot be specifically allocated but are eliminated on consolidation.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n(continued)\n3.
