The world has become a more dangerous place, affecting the lives of millions of people, with around 60 active conflicts across 36 countries. Whether it is high-profile conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the spiralling Middle East violence or lesser-known conflicts such as Myanmar or the DRC, the devastation and misery caused to the countries and people concerned is immense.\nIn addition, cybercrime is also at an all time high from individuals, organisations and state actors with high-profile names such as, Marks & Spencer, the Co-op, North Face and Cartier amongst many companies and organisations who have faced damaging cyber-attacks. The need for companies, governments and organisations to protect against cyber warfare has never been greater - this not only requires adequate defence mechanisms but for key employees to be trained in the advanced skills to deal with cyber-attacks.\nIn consideration of the above, Westminster have now established a new Cyber & Defence Technology Division, which will be focussed on providing governments and organisations with a range of solutions to meet the growing challenges in an uncertain world.\nCommenting on the new division, Westminster's Chief Executive Officer,\u00a0Peter Fowler, said:\n\"Whilst we already have a wide portfolio of security and non-aggressive defence solutions being delivered through our various operating companies, we believe establishing a division focussed on the growing threats from conflict and cyber-attack would be beneficial in establishing Westminster as a leader in this area. To those ends, we are already in discussions with potential partners and specialist manufacturers in the sector\nto provide additional products and solutions that we believe will lead to an exciting future expansion of our services.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nWestminster Group Plc\nMedia enquiries via Walbrook PR\nRt.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\nWestminster Group Plc\n('Westminster', the 'Group' or the 'Company')\n\u00a31.15 million New Contract Award\nWestminster Group Plc\u00a0(AIM: WSG), a leading supplier of managed services and technology-based security solutions worldwide, is pleased to announce that it has secured an extension contract award valued at an additional circa \u00a31.15 million.\nThe contract is an extension to the contract previously announced on 30 June 2025 to provide a Parliamentary Broadcast System for the parliamentary debating chamber\nof an\nEast African Parliament.\nThe system combines a state-of-the-art multimedia conferencing system with broadcast quality IP cameras and audio system for recording and broadcasting parliamentary debates to media outlets and social media platforms. The advanced multimedia touch screen allows attendees to select language, agenda and meeting data, internet access, voting and identification functionality.\nCommenting on the new contract award, Westminster's Chief Executive Officer,\u00a0Peter Fowler, said:\n\"I have previously announced that the global economic situation had caused a number of technology contract awards to be delayed due to customer's budget constraints. I am delighted, therefore, to be able to announce our technology division has secured its fourth significant contract win over the past three weeks.\n\"With three recent contracts already announced totalling circa \u00a3900,000, this latest contract, valued at circa \u00a31.15 million, brings the total order value for larger technology contracts secured in the last three weeks to circa \u00a32.05 million, in addition to numerous smaller contracts being secured.\n\"I am particularly pleased to be able to announce this significant extension contract for the East African Parliament, so soon after the initial contract award was announced on 30 June 2025. At that time, I stated we expected to secure an even larger additional contract award and the fact this came so soon after the initial award is an indication of the customer's confidence in Westminster and the hard work of our development teams. The project is expected to be largely, if not completely, delivered in the current financial year.\n\"These are important new technology contract awards. Plus, we have large-scale managed services projects such as Gabon which is now live, and others coming on stream hopefully later this year, such as DRC, which has been helped by the recent peace talks and other developments. These together with our current run rate business, provides an encouraging start to the new financial year.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nWestminster Group Plc\nMedia enquiries via Walbrook PR\nRt.

A minimum annual interest saving of \u00a3100,000 is therefore achieved under this arrangement.\nPantheon has undertaken not to convert any of the CLNs for a period of 12 months, and in line with all regulatory requirements as appropriate at the time. All other terms of the CLN remain unchanged.\nRelated Party Transaction\nPantheon has a current shareholding in the Company of 27.8% and is therefore categorised as a Substantial Shareholder of the Company pursuant to the AIM Rules for Companies (\"AIM Rules\"). Jing Zhou represents Pantheon on the board of Westminster. Accordingly, the above transactions with Pantheon are classified as a related party transaction pursuant to the AIM Rules.\nThe independent Directors of the Company, having consulted with Strand Hanson Limited, the Company's Nominated Adviser, consider that the above transactions are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nCommenting on the new credit facility, Westminster's Chief Executive Officer,\u00a0Peter Fowler, said:\n\"Pantheon is an extremely supportive investor in the business and this latest funding facility demonstrates their continued support and strong belief in the Company and its future growth and success. To have a facility like this, effectively an interest free overdraft, available, if required, for short term use will be a great asset.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nWestminster Group Plc\nMedia enquiries via Walbrook PR\nRt.

This not only includes the provision of advanced detection, surveillance, and screening equipment, but also the maintenance, training and various support services required to ensure airport security at these four airports is run to the highest international standards.

It is sad that it has taken a tragedy and Figen's remarkable energy to bring it about.\n\"Like so many people I have been impressed by Figen's determination and stamina in relentlessly driving the campaign for Martyn's Law and I am both pleased and honoured we have been able to assist during the process and to have her as part of the Westminster Group International Advisory Board.\nHer insight, determination, and deep commitment to safeguarding lives align perfectly with Westminster Group's mission to keep people safe and our broad range of services and expertise are available to assist companies meet the requirements of this landmark legislation.\"\nCommenting further, Figen Murray, said:\n\u200b\n\"I would like to thank everyone who has supported and assisted us in this endeavour over the years. It was a massive team effort. I am delighted the legislation is finally law after all these years. It will without any doubt save lives.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\nWestminster Group Plc\n('Westminster', the 'Group' or the 'Company')\nNew 15+ Year, Multi-Million \u00a3 Managed Services Contract Covering 4 Airports in the Gabonese Republic (Gabon) and Subscription to Raise \u00a31.2 million\nWestminster Group Plc\u00a0(AIM: WSG), a leading supplier of managed services and technology-based security solutions worldwide, is pleased to announce that it has signed a 15+ year contract for security services to four airports in Gabon.\nContracts were officially signed during the General Assembly of the National Council for Security and Facilitation of the Civil Aviation of Gabon in Libreville by representatives of Westminster and the Ministry of Transport, in the presence of various government officials and dignitaries.\nThe contract, which is for an initial period of 15 years with a 5-year renewal thereafter, is to provide comprehensive ground security operations at three international airports and one domestic airport within Gabon.\nWestminster will provide the investment and expertise required to upgrade security at the airports. This not only includes the provision of advanced detection, surveillance, and screening equipment, but also the maintenance, training and various support services required to ensure Gabon's airport security is run to the highest international standards. Thereby assisting the authorities develop and maintain world-class airport security services, opening up the potential for growth in air traffic by attracting new international carriers and commercial enterprises to the region.\nThe contract is based on Westminster's managed services model successfully deployed elsewhere in Africa. Revenues will be driven by embarking passenger numbers using the airports and funded by a per passenger fee, denominated in USD, collected through the ticketing system and payable directly to Westminster by the airlines or a suitable collection agency such as the International Air Transport Association ('IATA'). Based on current embarking passenger levels the contract is expected to generate revenues of circa $5.5m USD in the first 12 months of operation.\nThe contract includes a 90-day transition period to allow for operational planning and deployment processes to be completed, although Westminster will immediately deploy its transition team to commence planning, training, procurement and logistics.\nSubscription\nThe Company also announces it has agreed to issue Pantheon A Family Office Limited ('Pantheon') 100,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1p each ('Ordinary Shares') (the 'Subscription Shares') at a price of 1.2p per Subscription Share (representing a premium to the closing mid-market price of 1.1p per Ordinary Share on 03 March 2025), to raise \u00a31,200,000 before expenses (the 'Subscription'). 25 million warrants with an exercise price of 2.5p and 25 million warrants with an exercise price of 10p have been conditionally issued to Pantheon as part of the Subscription, subject to Board and shareholder approval, and with a three-year exercise period from point of issue. It is also intended that Pantheon will appoint a representative to the Board in due course.\nThe Subscription was conditional on the signing of the Gabon Contract and the net proceeds of the Subscription, being \u00a31,000,000, will be utilised for working capital purposes for the project.\nFollowing the Subscription, Pantheon will be interested in 125,433,333 Ordinary Shares, representing 27.79% of the Company's enlarged share capital.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made for the Subscription Shares, which will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing issued Ordinary Shares, to be admitted to trading on AIM ('Admission') once funds have been received pursuant to the Subscription. It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the Subscription Shares on AIM will commence at 8:00 a.m. on or around 12 March 2025.\nIn accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules ('DTRs'), the Company hereby announces that following Admission of the Subscription Shares, it will have 451,347,993 Ordinary Shares in issue, none of which are held in treasury. Therefore, following Admission the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 451,347,993, which may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the DTRs.\nCommenting on the Contract Award, Westminster's Chief Exec",

Determined to prevent such tragedies in the future, Figen has worked tirelessly to improve security legislation and raise awareness of the need for greater public safety measures.\nHer insight, determination, and deep commitment to safeguarding lives align perfectly with Westminster Group's mission to keep people safe.\nCommenting on Figen Murray's Appointment, Westminster's CEO, Peter Fowler, said:\n\"I am both honoured and delighted Figen has agreed to be part of the Westminster Group International Advisory Board.\n\"Like so many people I have been impressed by Figen's determination and stamina in relentlessly driving the campaign for Martyn's Law and without her outstanding achievements this essential piece of legislation, now going through its final stages, would never have come about.\n\"Martyn's Law will enhance public safety by ensuring the public are better protected and businesses are better prepared for terrorist activity, something that is increasingly necessary, and it is sad that it has taken a tragedy and Figen's remarkable energy to bring it about.\n\"I am confident that by working together with Figen we will help ensure the full benefits of Martyn's Law are delivered.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nWestminster Group Plc\nMedia enquiries via Walbrook PR\nRt.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\nWestminster Group Plc\n('Westminster', the 'Group' or the 'Company')\nAGM Statement and Change of Broker\nWestminster Group Plc (AIM: WSG), a leading supplier of managed services and technology-based security solutions worldwide, will hold its Annual General Meeting today\nat 10am at Westminster House, Blacklocks Hill, Banbury, OX17 2BS.\nAhead of the AGM Westminster's Chief Executive Officer, Peter Fowler, has issued the following statement.\nIn our 2024 Annual Report issued on 06 November 2024 I reported that we continued to battle against one of the worst world economic and political backgrounds of recent times. Since then, we have seen further instability in the Middle East and a less than helpful budget in the UK.\nNot-with-standing this, the outlook for our business remains encouraging. As mentioned in our recent Annual Report we have built a solid foundation for our business, and that we will enter 2025 with greatly increased revenues from contracts already secured.\nOur work on the DRC contract continues to progress and we anticipate we will complete the transition phase and commence formal operations in Q1 2025, bringing 5 more airports into our portfolio and a significant increase in our ongoing recurring revenue stream.\nWe continue to process important new long-term opportunities including another near-term prospect for potentially several more airports which, if secured, would further increase the scale and geographical spread of our aviation business.\nWe are focussed on building a resilient business based on multiple revenue streams, many of which are from long-term recurring revenue contracts, from multiple customers, in multiple jurisdictions, which is and will continue to be a key growing strength of our business.\nOur reputation grows with each new contract secured and in October 2024 we were honoured to receive the prestigious award of Best Global Aviation Security Provider 2024 during the London Political Summit & Awards held in the UK Parliament, in recognition of the contribution to aviation security Westminster is making around the world, through the supply of equipment, training and long-term managed services.\nOur guarding business is going from strength to strength, particularly where we can offer enhanced services with technology and training. In this respect we were also pleased to announce in October that we had secured a contract to provide security concierge services across a number of prominent sites in the United Kingdom adding a further \u00a3650,000 to Westminster's annual recurring revenue stream. We also stated that additionally we were in discussions regarding security solutions for some of this customer's sites elsewhere in the world, which we hoped would result in additional contracts. I am pleased to report further business has already been secured.\nSuch contracts underscore our commitment to delivering high-quality, customer-focused security and support solutions to governments and 'Blue Chip' organisations around the world, a further example of which is a recent contract, secured in November, to provide comprehensive X-ray maintenance and training services with a leading global financial leader and only last week announced a contract to provide cellular detection systems in European Prisons.\nWe are also pleased to see the Martyn's Law legislation has just passed its third reading in Parliament and that it has now progressed to the House of Lords\nmarking a pivotal step toward its enactment. As we have previously stated we believe Martyn's Law offers numerous opportunities for our business. As a global leader in security solutions, Westminster Group Plc stands ready to assist venues and businesses in meeting these new legal obligations.\nWe have also been encouraged by the results of the recent elections in Ghana and we believe this may deliver renewed business opportunities for Westminster.\nWe have a current order book of over \u00a31.3 million in addition to annual recurring revenues of circa \u00a314.4m (including DRC estimates) with the potential to materially increase this through additional contracts in the year ahead.\nWhilst we remain mindful that global events can still impact business outlook and the outcome or timing of potential projects is never certain, the achievements we are making and the contracts we are securing, underpin our confidence for the future long-term growth and success of our business.\nChange of Broker:\nAs part of the Company's ongoing strategic review Westminster announces it has appointed Strand Hanson Limited, who already act as the Company's NOMAD, to also act as",

This review included consultations with advisors and various stakeholders and is something any responsible board should undertake from time to time.\nAs indicated in the recent Final Results announcement, the Company has significantly increased its business prospects, including now having annual contracted recurring revenue in excess of \u00a314m (including DRC estimates). The Company also advised the market that it hopes to finalise an additional managed services contract in the near future.\nAccordingly, the directors believe that this significant growth in business together with other measures to be put in place in the months ahead, as a direct result of this review, will have a positive impact on shareholder value. Such measures do not include cancelling its admission to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.\nFor further information please contact:\nWestminster Group Plc\nMedia enquiries via Walbrook PR\nRt.

Whilst no revenues from this contract are reflected in the reporting period, the 10+ year contract is expected to generate revenues of circa US$10m in the first 12 months of operation alone, with significant scope for growth.\nThis, together with existing and new contracts provides a solid foundation for significant revenue and earnings growth for 2025 and beyond.\n\"We are focussed on building a resilient business based on multiple revenue streams, many of which are from long-term recurring revenue contracts, from multiple customers, in multiple jurisdictions, which is and will continue to be a key growing strength of our business. The strong performance of our various services revenue streams demonstrates our strategy in this respect, is on track.\n\"Despite the global uncertainty and economic challenges, in the period we delivered revenues of \u00a39.1m. Our Services Division has performed well, delivering revenues of \u00a37.2m, whilst our Technology Division revenues were impacted, delivering revenues of \u00a31.9m. Gross margin increased to 60%.\n\"We have a current order book of circa \u00a31m and annual recurring revenues of circa \u00a314.3m (including DRC estimates) with the potential to materially increase this through additional new contracts in the year ahead.\n\"Whilst remaining mindful global events can still impact business outlook and despite the global challenges and setbacks we have experienced, the recovery and growth we are seeing in our various businesses, together with our business model and the opportunities we have been developing and investing in over",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\nWestminster Group Plc\n('Westminster', the 'Group' or the 'Company')\nCompletion of Signing of 10+ Year, Multi-Million \u00a3 Managed Services Contract covering 5 Airports in the\u00a0DRC\nWestminster Group Plc\u00a0(AIM: WSG), a leading supplier of managed services and technology-based security solutions worldwide, is pleased to announce that the ratification process for the 10+ year contract, initially signed in June 2021 for security services to five airports in the\u00a0Democratic Republic of the Congo\u00a0('DRC'),\u00a0Central Africa, has been completed and contracts signed\n.\nContracts were officially signed today during the UK - DRC Trade and Investment Mission, at a formal ceremony in Kinshasa by board representatives of both Westminster and the airport authority, La Regie Des Voies Aeriennes ('RVA'), in the presence of various government officials and dignitaries including Lord Popat,\nthe UK Prime Minister's Trade Envoy;\nJohn Humphrey, His Majesty's Trade Commissioner for Africa; HE Alyson King OBE, HM Ambassador to the DRC; and HE Ndolamb Ngokwey, Ambassador of the DRC to the United Kingdom.\nThe contract, which is for an initial period of 10 years, with a five-year renewal thereafter, is to provide comprehensive ground security operations, initially at four international airports and one national airport in the DRC.\nWestminster will provide all the investment and expertise required to upgrade security at the airports. This not only includes the provision of advanced detection, surveillance, and screening equipment, but also the maintenance, training and various support services required to ensure DRC's airport security is run to the highest international standards. This enhancement in airport security will assist the authorities in DRC in developing and maintaining world-class airport security services, opening up the potential for growth in air traffic by attracting new international carriers and commercial enterprises to the region.\nAs part of the programme, Westminster will also be establishing an aviation security training academy to provide certified training to international standards for all aviation security ('AVSEC') staff within the country, ensuring that DRC's AVSEC staff are amongst the best trained, motivated, and valued in the entire region.\nThe contract is based on Westminster's managed services model successfully deployed elsewhere in Africa. Revenues will be driven by embarking passenger numbers using the airports and funded by a per passenger fee, denominated in US$, collected through the ticketing system and payable directly to Westminster by the airlines or a suitable collection agency such as the International Air Transport Association ('IATA'). Based on current international embarking passenger levels, the contract is expected to generate revenues of circa US$10m in the first 12 months of operation. In addition, there is an opportunity under the contract for further revenues, in due course, from domestic traffic and cargo screening operations.\nThe contract includes a 90-day transition period to allow for operational planning and recruitment processes to be completed. Operations and revenues are therefore expected to formally commence in July 2024, although Westminster will immediately deploy its transition team to commence planning, recruitment, training, procurement and logistics.\nInitial funding for the project will be from Westminster's own resources and the Company has engaged with specialist corporate advisors to secure required funding beyond that stage, with several options under consideration focussed on project-based debt capital.\nCommenting on the Contract Award, Westminster's Chief Executive Officer,\u00a0Peter Fowler, said:\n\"I am delighted to be able to announce this important new contract during the UK - DRC Trade and Investment Mission.\n\"The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a key addition to our international aviation security services, and we believe the country has exciting growth potential. With a surface area equivalent to that of Western Europe it is, by area, the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, the second largest in all of Africa, and the 11th-largest in the world. It is also the most-populous Francophone country in the world. Air travel is therefore an important and a necessary requirement within this vast country. DRC is extremely rich in natural resources and has the potential for sizeable economic growth. I look forward to Westminster having a long-term presence in the country and in playing our part in the successful growth and security of the country's numerous airports.\"\nC",

I am sure the 0.7s purchase will be memorable but let\u2019s get out of suspension first \u2026.. not sure what going nuts means, sounds like more dilution to me when/if they get their new mystery friend.  As for project finance\u2026 Pete strikes some of the weirdest deals known to man, I remember one from about 5 years ago that needed a NASA scientist to understand\u2026 completely fooked Pete over and shareholders\u2026. The next deal is bound to be as good.  B",

I am sure the 0.7s purchase will be memorable but let\u2019s get out of suspension first \u2026.. not sure what going nuts means, sounds like more dilution to me when/if they get their new mystery friend.  As for project finance\u2026 Pete strikes some of the weirdest deals known to man, I remember one from about 5 years ago that needed a NASA scientist to understand\u2026 completely fooked Pete over and shareholders\u2026.
