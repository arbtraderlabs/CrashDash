      "The stock is effectively inactive \u2013 ATR and 20\u2011day StdDev are zero and the last recorded price is 0.00p, indicating a suspended or liquidated status.",
      "Google Trends shows a strong retail FOMO spike (+79% momentum, 53/100 interest) despite zero social chatter or RNS, pointing to a disconnect between search interest and actual trading.",
      "The crash signal reports an 87.9% drawdown from peak yet the base score (8/21) is moderate, suggesting that the price plunge may be more structural (e.g., delisting) than market\u2011driven."

    "hidden_patterns": [
      "Zero volatility coupled with high retail interest is a classic pump\u2011and\u2011dump precursor \u2013 the search spike may be artificially inflating perceived demand.",
      "The absence of any RNS or catalysts, combined with a 0.00p entry price, hints at a hidden liquidity trap where the stock could remain at zero until a corporate event triggers relisting."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [
      "Retail FOMO rising while the stock is essentially dormant implies that a sudden relisting or announcement could ignite a rapid price rally, making OBD.L a potential contrarian play if a catalyst emerges."

      "High probability of delisting or liquidation; the price may stay at zero indefinitely.",
      "Extreme liquidity risk \u2013 any trade could cause a massive price swing, making the stock highly manipulable and unsuitable for typical investors.",

    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If a corporate event (e.g., asset sale, new business line, or re\u2011listing) surfaces, the current retail FOMO could translate into a sharp upside.",

    "narrative_summary": "OBD.L is effectively dormant with zero trading activity and volatility, yet Google Trends shows a strong retail FOMO wave. This mismatch signals a potential pump\u2011and\u2011dump scenario or a hidden liquidity trap. While the stock\u2019s crash bottom suggests undervaluation, the high risk of delisting and extreme liquidity constraints mean that only contrarian, short\u2011term speculative plays should consider it, pending a clear catalyst that could revive trading."
