      "OBD.L is effectively a *dead ticker*: price, volatility and social chatter are all zero, yet Google Trends shows a +1063% momentum spike, indicating a data artefact rather than genuine market activity.",

      "Cross\u2011signal conflict: Google Trends flags the ticker as dead, but the crash\u2011zone base score of 8/21 suggests the algorithm still treats it as a tradable security, revealing a mismatch between data feeds."
    ],
    "hidden_patterns": [
      "Zero ATR and 20\u2011day StdDev imply a *complete price freeze* \u2013 the stock has not moved for the entire data window, a classic sign of regulatory suspension or administrative delisting.",
      "The entry price of 0.00p is inconsistent with any realistic market price; it is likely a placeholder used when the last known price is unavailable, which can trigger false crash alerts."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [
      "Google Trends momentum (+1063%) is the only positive indicator; if the ticker ever resumes trading, this could signal a rapid, albeit risky, rebound\u2014contrary to the prevailing view of a dead security."

    "risk_warnings": [
      "High probability of *non\u2011tradability*: no price movement, zero volatility, and no RNS or catalysts strongly suggest the company is delisted or suspended.",

    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If regulatory action is reversed (e.g., a reinstatement or a special purpose acquisition company spin\u2011out), the stock could experience a sharp price jump from a 0.00p base, but only after a clear catalyst appears.",
      "For very risk\u2011tolerant investors, the zero\u2011cost entry (0.00p) could be attractive if the company is re\u2011listed, though the probability of a positive outcome is extremely low."

    "narrative_summary": "OBD.L appears to be a dead ticker with no price activity, zero volatility, and no recent disclosures, yet a residual crash\u2011zone signal and a spurious Google\u2011trend spike create a confusing data profile. The likely reality is regulatory suspension or delisting; any trading activity would be contingent on a formal relisting event, which is highly improbable without new corporate action."
