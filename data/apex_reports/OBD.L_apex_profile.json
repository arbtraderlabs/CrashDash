      "The crash\u2011zone bottom signal (87.9% drawdown from a nonexistent peak) is a paradoxical indicator of a potential bottom, but it may simply reflect a legacy record of a prior trading episode that has since ceased.",

      "The crash\u2011zone bottom score of 8.0/21 is derived from a 0 entry price; mathematically any price drop from 0 is undefined, yet the algorithm still produces a percentage, highlighting a logic flaw in the crash\u2011zone module."

The data shows significant logical inconsistencies (zero volatility, zero price yet 87.9% drawdown) that signal a quality issue, but the contrarian momentum could hint at a relisting or new business model. Investors should verify the company\u2019s legal status and regulatory compliance before considering any action, as the risks of data errors and liquidity are high."
