Notwithstanding the UK Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Retail Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Retail Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Retail Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The UK Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Retail Offer.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the UK Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of Chapters 9A or 10A respectively of COBS; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Retail Shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Retail Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.\nEU Product Governance Requirements\nSolely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended (\"\nMiFID II\n\"); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the \"\nMiFID II Product Governance Requirements\n\"), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any \"manufacturer\" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Retail Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that the Retail Shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the \"\nEU Target Market Assessment\n\").

NEITHER THIS ANNOUNCEMENT NOR THE FACT OF ITS DISTRIBUTION SHALL FORM THE BASIS OF, OR BE RELIED ON IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY INVESTMENT DECISION IN RESPECT OF HAYDALE GRAPHENE INDUSTRIES PLC.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU) 596 / 2014 WHICH FORMS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018 (\"MAR\"). IN ADDITION, MARKET SOUNDINGS (AS DEFINED IN MAR) WERE TAKEN IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN OF THE MATTERS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, WITH THE RESULT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS BECAME AWARE OF SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION, AS PERMITTED BY MAR. UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND SUCH PERSONS SHALL THEREFORE CEASE TO BE IN POSSESSION OF INSIDE INFORMATION.\nDEFINED TERMS IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN THE LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT, RELEASED AT 07:00 A.M. ON 12 DECEMBER 2025, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.\n15 December 2025\nHAYDALE GRAPHENE INDUSTRIES PLC\n(\"\nHaydale\n\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nResult of Accelerated Bookbuild\nHaydale (AIM:HAYD), the global advanced materials group, is pleased to announce that further to its announcement at\n07:00 a.m. on 12 December 2025\n(the \"\nLaunch Announcement\n\"), it has completed the ABB which is now closed.\nThe ABB has raised in aggregate \u00a34.7 million which together with the \u00a30.54 million raised through the Subscriptions (including a further subscription received on 12 December 2025 of \u00a324,100) amounts to \u00a35.25 million, all at the Issue Price of 0.5 pence per New Ordinary Share. Further details on the Fundraising are included in the Launch Announcement.\nThe total amount raised by the ABB is approximately \u00a30.7 million lower than contemplated in the Launch Announcement as a result of the failure of certain market counterparties to provide confirmations to orders previously indicated during the market sounding process which preceded launch. As a result of this the aggregate deal costs are reduced by approximately \u00a30.1 million, resulting in net Fundraising proceeds of up to \u00a34.75 million (compared with up to \u00a35.29 million in the Launch Announcement). The Board is comfortable that this amount satisfies the Enlarged Group's working capital requirements and satisfies conditions precedent to the Acquisition. The resulting amended Share Capital Statistics table included in the Launch Announcement is set out below.\nIn addition to the Placing and Subscription, the Company also announced that it is providing its existing Retail Investors with the opportunity to subscribe for an aggregate of up to 100,000,000\nRetail Shares at the Issue Price via the Bookbuild platform, to raise up to an additional \u00a3\n0.5\nmillion (before expenses). In view of the above the Directors have decided to keep the Retail Offer open for another day. Accordingly, the Retail Offer will now close at midday on 16 December 2025 (rather than 15 December as previously announced) and the results of the Retail Offer will be announced separately thereafter.\nAs set out in more detail in the Launch Announcement, the net funds raised by the Fundraising will be used to support the Enlarged Group's growth plan and capitalise on the commercial opportunities unlocked by the Acquisition.\nHaydale Convertible Loan Notes and Total Voting Rights\nAs contemplated in the Launch Announcement, the Company is pleased to confirm that exercise of the Haydale Convertible Loan Notes occurred on 12 December 2025 following launch of the ABB. The Haydale CLN Shares have accordingly now been issued and allotted, conditional only on their admission. Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the admission of the 417,883,894 Haydale CLN Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM. It is expected that admission will take place on or before 8.00 a.m. on 18 December 2025.\nFollowing admission of the Haydale CLN Shares (and prior to the issue of any of the additional New Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Fundraising or Acquisition) the Company will have in issue 4,740,839,841 Ordinary Shares, with no shares held in treasury. This figure may be used by Shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in or a change to their interest in, Haydale under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nAdmission of the Fundraising Shares and First Tranche Consideration Shares\nApplications will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Fundraising Shares and the First Tranche Consideration Shares to trading on AIM. Admission of the Fundraising Shares is expected to take place at 8.00 a.m. on 7 January 2026. Admission of the First Tranche Consideration Shares is expected to take place at 8.00 a.m. on 8 January 2026.\nThe Fundraising Shares and First Tranche Consideration Shares will, when issued, rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.\nPosting of Circular and Notice of General Meeting\nA Circular containing the Notice of General Meeting is expected to be posted to Shareholders on 15 December 2025. The Company will also publish this on its website pursuant to AIM Rule 26. The General Meeting will be held on 6 January at 11:00 a.m. at the of\ufb01ces of Field\ufb01sher LLP, Riverbank House, 2 Swan Lane, London EC4R 3TT, notice of which will be set out at the end of the Circular.\nAction to be taken\nShareholders will find enclosed with the Circular a Form of Proxy for use at the General Meeting. Regardless of whether Shareholders intend to attend the General Meeting, they are requested to complete, sign and return the Form of Proxy, in accordance with the instructions printed thereon, so as to be received by the Company's registrars, Share Registrars Limited, 3 The Millennium Centre, Crosby Way, Farnham, Surrey, GU9 7XX, as soon\u00a0as possible,\u00a0and\u00a0in\u00a0any\u00a0event by\u00a0no\u00a0later than 11.00 a.m. 2 January 2026.
