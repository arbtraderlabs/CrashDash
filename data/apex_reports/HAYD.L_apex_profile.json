All conditions to completion have now been satisfied, including the associated fundraising, shareholder approvals and admissions of new shares. SMCC is now fully part of the Haydale Group.\nFundraising\nIn connection with the Acquisition, the Company has completed a fundraising, with gross proceeds raised of approximately \u00a35.75m.\nSubscriptions were made by an array of investors including Haydale's existing key strategic investor Quidos Technologies Limited (which is owned by the CEO, Simon Turek, and long-time strategic investor Nick Pritchard), SMCC's existing key strategic investor Barclays, tax efficient EIS investors as well as Mark Sait, Chief Commercial Officer of the enlarged Group and CEO of SMCC, and Theresa Wallis, Non-Executive Director.\nThe participation of senior management and strategic partners strongly aligns interests with shareholders and underlines confidence in the enlarged Group's strategy. The Company also notes that demand for the retail offer exceeded available shares, reflecting strong investor support for both the Acquisition and Haydale's strategic direction.\nStrategic Rationale and Value Creation\nThe completion of this Acquisition marks a step-change in Haydale's evolution, accelerating its transition from advanced materials innovator to a commercially scalable, graphene-enabled clean-technology platform with immediate market access.\nAs previously outlined, SMCC brings substantial and highly complementary strategic benefits:\nA national, nil-cost customer acquisition engine\nSMCC's Impact Partner Programme embeds its Sustainability Hub directly into the client offerings of major UK banks and utilities, including Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and Wave Utilities. These partners fund the platform in return for verified ESG and carbon data and actively refer their customers to SMCC as part of their own Net Zero, lending and efficiency programmes. As a result, SMCC generates a continuous flow of pre-qualified B2B opportunities at effectively zero marginal acquisition cost, eliminating traditional sales and marketing spend while delivering a scalable, partner-funded route-to-market for Haydale's graphene-enabled technologies.\nA proven B2B delivery platform at scale\nThe Acquisition adds an established end-to-end commercial capability covering ESG advisory, audits, design, financing support, installation and ongoing service delivery. SMCC has a strong track record of executing complex energy and water-efficiency projects across the UK, materially strengthening Haydale's ability to convert technology into revenue.\nRapid deployment of graphene-enabled products\nSMCC provides a ready-made route to market for Haydale's proprietary technologies, most notably JustHeat, the Company's graphene-based heating system, alongside future graphene-enhanced products. In parallel, Haydale's technology materially enhances SMCC's offering, enabling clients to adopt deeper, more cost-effective decarbonisation solutions.\nTogether, the enlarged Group is now exceptionally well positioned to address accelerating demand for practical, investable decarbonisation in the built environment. Haydale's advanced materials and product innovation, combined with SMCC's market access and execution capability, creates a vertically integrated clean-tech platform capable of delivering measurable carbon, energy and water savings at scale.\nIntegration and Next Steps\nIntegration of SMCC into the Group is now underway. SMCC will continue to operate its successful Impact Partner Programme and client services, now supported by Haydale's technology portfolio and balance sheet.\nJustHeat will be incorporated immediately into SMCC's solution set, creating near-term cross-selling opportunities across SMCC's existing and future customer pipeline. The Board expects this to accelerate commercial traction and shorten sales cycles.\nAs part of the transaction, Mark Sait, co-founder and CEO of SMCC, has joined the Board of Haydale as an Executive Director and assumes the role of Chief Commercial Officer of the enlarged Group. Mark and the SMCC management team bring deep sector expertise and a strong commercial track record, and will work closely with Haydale's leadership to drive integration and growth",

Existing Shareholders received 100 per cent. of their soft pre-emptive allowance when their order matched or exceeded their soft pre-emptive allowance. Given the level of demand, where the order was greater than the soft pre-emptive allowance shareholders received approximately 82.85 per cent. of their additional demand.\nAccordingly, conditional on the passing of the Resolutions at the General Meeting, the Company has conditionally raised total gross proceeds of approximately \u00a35.75 million in aggregate by way of the Fundraising.\nSubject to, inter alia, Shareholders passing the Resolutions at the General Meeting to be held on 6 January 2026, applications will be made to the London Stock Exchange in connection with First Admission for the admission of a total of 1,150,000,000 New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM.

Applications will also be made to the London Stock Exchange in connection with Second Admission for the admission of a total of 1,860,465,116 First Tranche Consideration Shares and 23,404,142 SMCC CLN Shares to trading on AIM. The New Ordinary Shares, when issued, will rank pari passu with the Existing Ordinary Shares then in issue.\nSubject to, and conditional on, the Resolutions being passed at the General Meeting, First Admission is expected to occur on 7 January 2026. Second Admission is expected to occur on 8 January 2026.\nA separate announcement will be made following the General Meeting as to the results of the General Meeting and the total voting rights following Admission.\nUnless otherwise defined, all capitalised terms used but not defined in this announcement shall have the meaning given to them in the announcement of the Fundraising made by the Company on 12 December 2025.\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nSimon Turek, CEO\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nJulian Blunt / Edward Whiley / Trisyia Jamaludin, Corporate Finance\nAndrew Burdis, ECM\nAllenby Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3002 2073\nNick Naylor / Alex Brearley / Vivek Bhardwaj, Corporate Finance\nJos Pinnington, Sales and Corporate Broking\nOAK Securities (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3973 3678\nJerry Keen / Calvin Man, Corporate Broking\nThis announcement should be read in its entirety.

IN ADDITION, MARKET SOUNDINGS (AS DEFINED IN MAR) WERE TAKEN IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN OF THE MATTERS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, WITH THE RESULT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS BECAME AWARE OF SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION, AS PERMITTED BY MAR. UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND SUCH PERSONS SHALL THEREFORE CEASE TO BE IN POSSESSION OF INSIDE INFORMATION.\nDEFINED TERMS IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN THE LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT, RELEASED AT 07:00 A.M. ON 12 DECEMBER 2025, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.\n15 December 2025\nHAYDALE GRAPHENE INDUSTRIES PLC\n(\"\nHaydale\n\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nResult of Accelerated Bookbuild\nHaydale (AIM:HAYD), the global advanced materials group, is pleased to announce that further to its announcement at\n07:00 a.m. on 12 December 2025\n(the \"\nLaunch Announcement\n\"), it has completed the ABB which is now closed.\nThe ABB has raised in aggregate \u00a34.7 million which together with the \u00a30.54 million raised through the Subscriptions (including a further subscription received on 12 December 2025 of \u00a324,100) amounts to \u00a35.25 million, all at the Issue Price of 0.5 pence per New Ordinary Share. Further details on the Fundraising are included in the Launch Announcement.\nThe total amount raised by the ABB is approximately \u00a30.7 million lower than contemplated in the Launch Announcement as a result of the failure of certain market counterparties to provide confirmations to orders previously indicated during the market sounding process which preceded launch. As a result of this the aggregate deal costs are reduced by approximately \u00a30.1 million, resulting in net Fundraising proceeds of up to \u00a34.75 million (compared with up to \u00a35.29 million in the Launch Announcement). The Board is comfortable that this amount satisfies the Enlarged Group's working capital requirements and satisfies conditions precedent to the Acquisition. The resulting amended Share Capital Statistics table included in the Launch Announcement is set out below.\nIn addition to the Placing and Subscription, the Company also announced that it is providing its existing Retail Investors with the opportunity to subscribe for an aggregate of up to 100,000,000\nRetail Shares at the Issue Price via the Bookbuild platform, to raise up to an additional \u00a3\n0.5\nmillion (before expenses). In view of the above the Directors have decided to keep the Retail Offer open for another day. Accordingly, the Retail Offer will now close at midday on 16 December 2025 (rather than 15 December as previously announced) and the results of the Retail Offer will be announced separately thereafter.\nAs set out in more detail in the Launch Announcement, the net funds raised by the Fundraising will be used to support the Enlarged Group's growth plan and capitalise on the commercial opportunities unlocked by the Acquisition.\nHaydale Convertible Loan Notes and Total Voting Rights\nAs contemplated in the Launch Announcement, the Company is pleased to confirm that exercise of the Haydale Convertible Loan Notes occurred on 12 December 2025 following launch of the ABB. The Haydale CLN Shares have accordingly now been issued and allotted, conditional only on their admission. Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the admission of the 417,883,894 Haydale CLN Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM. It is expected that admission will take place on or before 8.00 a.m. on 18 December 2025.\nFollowing admission of the Haydale CLN Shares (and prior to the issue of any of the additional New Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Fundraising or Acquisition) the Company will have in issue 4,740,839,841 Ordinary Shares, with no shares held in treasury.

This includes: the signing of a distribution agreement with Interfloor; national industry recognition of the JustHeat product; and the receipt of first US orders. All these developments reflect the accelerating commercial momentum behind Haydale's transition towards being a scaled commercialised product and service provider.\nJustHeat Pillar: Interfloor Collaboration Update\nSince signing the Strategic Collaboration Agreement in September 2025 with Interfloor Limited (\"Interfloor\"), Haydale and Interfloor have moved rapidly from concept to a market-ready, integrated flooring range incorporating the JustHeat heating system. The range is now ready for commercial launch, ahead of the previously guided timeline of the first half of 2026.\nFollowing successful development, Haydale and Interfloor have now executed a Distribution Agreement.\nUnder this agreement, Interfloor - Europe's largest manufacturer of underlay and part of Victoria plc (AIM: VCP) - receives non-exclusive distribution rights for JustHeat within its new flooring range and will work exclusively with Haydale as its heating technology partner. In return, Haydale will source all underlay for Haydale-delivered installations exclusively from Interfloor, which becomes the recommended underlay supplier to Haydale's emerging network of third-party distribution channels, notably Quidos Protect with whom we signed a UK wide non-exclusive distribution agreement in June 2025.\nInterfloor will actively promote the new range through its established sales and distribution network, providing reach into more than 2,000 UK outlets and over 400 local distribution channels across 70 countries.\nThe collaboration with Interfloor represents the first step in expanding JustHeat beyond the residential market into commercial and industrial applications, materially widening the addressable market and acting as a key enabler of Haydale's accelerated commercialisation strategy.\nJustHeat Pillar: National Product of the Year\nJustHeat has recently been named National Product of the Year at the 2025 National Energy Efficiency Awards. The award recognises technologies that deliver measurable improvements in energy performance and provides strong third-party validation of JustHeat's efficiency, ease of installation and real-world impact.\nThis peer recognition is especially significant at this early stage of market rollout. It reinforces JustHeat's differentiation in the heating sector, supports installer and channel confidence, and strengthens the product's position as Haydale scales into multiple end-markets.\nJustHeat Pillar: Initial Commercial Orders Secured in the US\nSince announcing in June 2025 that the Company would shortly begin trials with a new US channel partner, its US market entry has progressed from pilot trials into early commercial agreements. Haydale has now signed two Collaboration Agreements worth, in aggregate, US$300,000 to tailor the JustHeat product for the US market.\nThese agreements provide early validation of JustHeat's performance and relevance in one of the world's largest heating markets and represent an important milestone in the Company's capital-light international expansion strategy.\nSimon Turek, CEO of Haydale, commented:\n\"Moving from concept to a market-ready Interfloor product range within months demonstrates the pace with which we are now executing. Interfloor's commitment to integrate JustHeat across its new flooring range and to promote it through their extensive sales and distribution network represents a step-change in our market reach. It also marks the beginning of our expansion into commercial and industrial applications.\nCoupled with national industry recognition, we enter FY26 with growing confidence in our ability to scale across multiple markets. These developments underline the strength of our technology platform and the commercial opportunity ahead.\"\nGary McEwan, CEO of Interfloor, commented:\n\"Embedding JustHeat into our underlay range gives customers a new proposition - flooring that provides warmth, comfort and energy efficiency in a single integrated solution. With our sales reach and Haydale's innovative technology, we believe we can bring this next-generation heating product to a large and growing audience.\"\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nSimon Turek, Chief Executive Officer - Tel: +44 (0) 1269 842946Gareth Kaminski-Cook, Non-Executive ChairPatrick Carter, Chief Financial Officer\nCavendish C",

Following successful testing, Haydale has now signed a strategic Collaboration Agreement with Interfloor.\nUnder the agreement, Haydale and Interfloor will collaborate to integrate JustHeat heater inserts with Interfloor's market-leading underlays and specified coverings, creating a new range of solutions for launch in H2 FY26.\nWith exports to 400+ customers in over 70 countries and weekly deliveries to more than 2,000 UK outlets, Interfloor provides a powerful route to specification-led adoption of JustHeat through established retail, distributor and contractor networks. Interfloor is part of Victoria plc (AIM: VCP), the international flooring group.\nAdditional Channel Partners\nInitial orders have now shipped to the channel partners announced in June, and further partners are being added to extend geographic and sectoral reach across the UK. Building on the UL certification achieved in June, the Company will shortly begin trials with a new US channel partner, marking an important step in its international expansion.\nThe current pipeline remains strongest in residential (owner-occupied and social housing) and residential-adjacent sectors (care homes, student accommodation), while the Company also sees opportunities in broader commercial and specialist applications, including modular housing and mobile homes.\nSupply Chain\nHaydale has established dedicated JustHeat print capacity in Changsha through a processing agreement with Hunan Heidai Graphene Materials, a specialist in printed electronics and conductive inks. Haydale's functionalised graphene inks continue to be manufactured in Wales, with printing undertaken in Changsha under the agreement. With capacity of c.1,000 linear metres per day, the facility is ready to support channel-partner roll-outs - providing scalable production without significant capex investment\n- while Haydale retains ownership of its IP and materials.\nThe processing arrangement confers standard processing-trade customs benefits on movement of goods into and out of the facility, reducing logistics cost and lead times. The site has passed a production audit by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the global safety certification and testing organisation. This follows the UL certification of JustHeat panels announced in June 2025, ensuring that offshore production meets internationally recognised quality standards.\nCost Restructuring\nIn line with the cost restructuring programme outlined in March 2025 in the Company's interim results, Haydale achieved monthly run-rate costs reduction below \u00a3200,000 by the end of FY25. This represents a 70% reduction from FY24 overhead run rates. This leaner cost base, combined with growing commercial traction, underpins the Board's confidence in delivering a capital-light growth model. The Company's unaudited cash balance as at the end of August 2025 was \u00a31.92m.\nSimon Turek, CEO of Haydale:\n\"This collaboration with Interfloor is a transformational step for JustHeat. It places our graphene-enabled heating technology directly into the product lines of one of Europe's most trusted flooring brands, providing a route to scale that few early-stage technologies achieve so quickly. Combined with our streamlined cost base and scalable supply chain, Haydale is positioned to deliver real commercial momentum in the months ahead.\"\nGary McEwan, CEO of Interfloor:\n\"Interfloor is always looking for innovations that deliver value to our customers and sustainability to the built environment. Partnering with Haydale allows us to integrate a cutting-edge heating solution into our well-established underlay products. We believe JustHeat has the potential to redefine comfort and efficiency in flooring systems across residential and commercial markets.\"\nFor further information\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nSimon Turek, Ch",

The award has been made in recognition of the continued support and contribution of staff during the Company's operational turnaround, including voluntary salary reductions, and is intended to retain and incentivise key personnel through this transitional phase.\nTerms of the New Options\nThe New Options granted under the 2020 EMI Scheme recognise the differing levels of voluntary salary reduction undertaken by management and staff during the Company's operational turnaround and are structured accordingly.\nNew Options granted to members of the senior management team (including Directors and Subsidiary Directors), who have continued to work full time but whose salary has been reduced as part of the Company's cost-saving measures, have an exercise price of 0.45 pence per Ordinary Share, representing the same price paid by investors in the recent fundraising completed on 27 June 2025 and a 22.4% discount to the mid-market closing price on the date of grant.\nNew Options granted to other employees, whose working hours and salary were reduced proportionally as part of the Company's cost-saving measures, have an exercise price of 0.58 pence per Ordinary Share, being the mid-market closing price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the date of grant.\nAll New Options will vest and become exercisable on\n30 June 2026\n, provided the relevant participant remains in continuous employment with the Company or any member of the Group (and has not served notice of resignation) as at that date. No other vesting criteria, performance hurdles, or accelerated vesting provisions apply.\nDetails of resultant holdings\nFollowing the New Options grant, details of Options held by Directors, PDMRs and other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, are as follows:\nDirector's name\nand employing Group company\nNumber of New Options granted\nAggregate number of options\npost grant\nCurrent total beneficial holding of Ordinary Shares\nCurrent holding as a % of Issued share capital\nSimon Turek*\n(Haydale Graphene Industries Plc)\n4,444,426\n4,444,426\n343,450,215\n7.94%\nPatrick Carter\n(Haydale Graphene Industries Plc)\n6,444,426\n36,444,426\n1,000,000\n0.05%\nDavid Davies\n(Haydale Ltd)\n4,368,000\n14,368,000\n50,671\n0.00%\nMark Heycock\n(Haydale Ltd)\n3,555,573\n13,555,573\n-\n-\nJohn-Mark Seymour\n(Haydale Ltd)\n3,200,000\n13,200,000\n-\n-\nOther Employees\n14,\n427\n,143\n34,\n177\n,143\nn/a\nn/a\nTotal:\n36,439,568\n116,189,568\n344,500,886\n7.99%\n*including Mr Turek's 49% indirect interest in Quidos Technologies Limited\nFollowing the New Options grant, the Company's total number of Options under the 2020 EMI Scheme outstanding as at the date of this announcement is\n116,189,568\nrepresenting approximately\n2.69\n% of the Company's existing issued share\ncapital and 2.71% on a\nfully diluted basis including all outstanding warrants.\nThe number of Ordinary Shares currently in issue is\n4,322,955,947\nand it is this number that has been used to calculate the above percentage shareholdings.\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nGareth Kaminski-Cook, Non-Executive Chair\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt/Edward Whiley/Trisyia Jamaludin, Corporate Finance\nAndrew Burdis, ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNotification and public disclosure of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them.\nNotification of a Transaction pursuant to Article 19(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na.\nName\n1.

The Company had interest in excess of the number of shares available.\nThe Issue Price represents a discount of 28.0 per cent. to the closing mid-market price on 25 June 2025, being the last practicable date prior to this announcement, and a premium of 21.0 per cent. to the Company's 30-day VWAP of \u00a30.0037 and a premium of 239.6% per cent. to the price at which the Company completed its last placing in October 2024.\nThe Subscriptions, raising approximately \u00a32.13 million in total, will be completed using the Company's existing authorities granted by shareholders at its last annual general meeting on 30 December 2024 and amount to 12.3 per cent. of Haydale's current issued share capital. The Subscriptions have been entered into on an expedited basis in light of the Company's commercial traction as outlined in the announcement of 12 June 2025 and to take advantage of the Company's existing HMRC tax clearance for the purposes of the EIS/VCT legislation which is due to expire on 30 June 2025.

UL (Underwriters Laboratories) is a globally recognised safety certification for consumer and industrial electrical products and provides assurance to regulatory authorities, landlords and insurers. This follows JustHeat's CE marking achieved earlier this year, supporting market access across Europe. In parallel, the Company has worked closely with its supply chain to ensure that the product can be produced consistently and economically at scale.\nThe Company has begun to see strong demand for JustHeat from social landlords in the UK, particularly in relation to long-term void replacement programmes where heating systems are installed across vacant properties within large housing portfolios. To date, Haydale has secured commitments for over 40 pilot installations across Welsh housing providers, with deployment scheduled over the coming months. Discussions are also ongoing with Wales' largest social housing provider to incorporate JustHeat in certain of their new build affordable home developments.\nHaydale has signed binding heads of terms for a strategic UK wide non-exclusive distribution agreement with Quidos Protect Limited (\"Quidos Protect\"), a national installer network comprised of more than 250 qualified heating engineers. This agreement will provide Haydale with full UK-wide delivery coverage, ensuring the capacity to deliver site surveys and installations at scale. Quidos Protect will operate as Haydale's preferred UK partner, pursuant to a delivery model under which Haydale manufactures and licenses the JustHeat technology whilst accredited partners carry out installation and servicing. This model provides strong margins, operational scalability and customer proximity, without the capital intensity or complexity of needing to build an in-house installation capability. The agreement is for an initial term of 24 months and will renew for additional 12-month terms subject to certain targets being met.\nIn parallel, Haydale has signed another binding heads of terms agreement for a five-year exclusive distribution contract with Jersey Energy Technologies (\"JET\") covering the Channel Islands. Based on the terms of the agreement, including a schedule of minimum order quantities covering years one to five, Haydale anticipates it could generate revenues for Haydale of \u00a36.0 million over the contract term based on JET's pipeline of opportunities in the Channel Islands, including with Andium Homes, a leading social housing provider.\nThese initiatives have already triggered additional inbound interest from potential commercial partners in Canada, Ireland, France, South Africa, Australia and the United States and Haydale are in early-stage discussions for non-exclusive distribution agreements in a number of these additional territories.\nTo further enhance customer confidence and reduce barriers to adoption, Haydale is in advanced discussions to offer an underwritten warranty for JustHeat installations. This product would provide long-term cover for performance and servicing, significantly enhancing appeal among customers including institutional landlords and housing developers.\nThe Company has also signed a commercialisation agreement with Noel & Marquet\u00a0(\"NMC\"), a leading European manufacturer of coving and skirting solutions, to develop and distribute a version of the JustHeat solution incorporated into NMC's products. These coving and skirting products have been specifically targeed in response to demand from social landlords seeking to address damp and mould issues in hard-to-heat properties and recently introduced legislation imposing additional obligations on landlords. Distribution of a finalised coving product through NMC's existing customer base is expected to enable rapid uptake across both retrofit and new-build portfolios.\nHaydale also continues to submit JustHeat to external testing for verification. Through its links with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (\"UWTSD\"), Haydale has entered into a strategic collaboration with the Constr",

While early engagement from prospective buyers suggested a strong level of initial interest, the auction process was ultimately undermined by growing caution around inward investment to the US and geopolitical tensions. In particular, escalating cross-border trade tensions and the imposition of reciprocal tariffs between the US and China\n- where a number of key suppliers in HCT's value chain are located\n- created significant uncertainty.\nGreenleaf Corporation ultimately made the highest offer during the process, which has today been confirmed by the court, amounting to c$680,000, though at this level the Board does not anticipate any cash being returned to the Group's UK entities against its intercompany debtor balance. As previously announced, all intergroup balances and investment have now been provided for in full. Following conclusion of the Court process, Haydale anticipates that an assets transaction will be finalised by the end of April and HCT then liquidated.\nDespite this outcome the Group's strategy has been successful in achieving its primary objectives of stemming cash outflows to the US and significantly reducing Group overhead costs and operational complexity, thereby contributing to the Group's goal of achieving improved profitability and cash flow in FY25, in order to protect Haydale's core business.\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nSimon Turek, Chief Executive Officer Tel: +44 (0) 1269 842946\nGareth Kaminski-Cook, Non-Executive Chair\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt / Edward Whiley / Trisyia Jamaludin, Corporate Finance Tel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nAndrew Burdis, ECM\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Group has secured the first commercial orders and has a growing pipeline of demand; and\n\u00d8\nNew commercial contracts have been secured with a leading funder of new heating systems to vulnerable households, Affordable Warmth Solutions, to develop a further graphene heater ink product, and with the national gas grid, National Gas Transmission, for the use of the Group's technology in upgrading the gas network.\nFinancial Highlights f\nor the six months ended 31 December 2024:\n\u00d8\nRevenues decreased by 50% to \u00a31.25 million (H1 FY24 \u00a32.47 million) reflecting persistent US under performance;\n\u00d8\nGross profit margin increased to 57.8% (H1 FY24 57%) reflecting changes in the product mix;\n\u00d8\nAdjusted administrative expenses decreased by 8% to \u00a33.00 million (H1 FY24: \u00a33.26 million) stemming from pre-Review cost reductions;\n\u00d8\nAdjusted operating loss increased by 32% to \u00a32.13 million (H1 FY24 \u00a31.61 million) reflecting reduced turnover; and\n\u00d8\nCash at Period end of \u00a31.99 million (31 December 2023: \u00a33.30 million).\nThese results underscore the rationale for the change in business strategy and the decisive actions taken to focus the business on near-term revenue opportunities, aggressively reduce costs and stem cash outflows in FY25, and in particular the divestment of the heavily loss making North-American business, all of which will contribute to the Group's goal of achieving improved profitability and cash flow in FY25, in order to protect the Group's core UK nanomaterials business. The monthly run-rate operating expenses for the remaining UK business is approximately \u00a30.275m.\nCommenting on the interim results, Simon Turek, Chief Executive Officer of Haydale, said:\n\"The interim results reflect the period before implementation of the new business strategy, highlighting the challenging financial position inherited by the new management team on January 1, 2025. With declining revenue and an unsustainable cost structure, immediate and decisive action was required.\nSince then, we have restructured the business, divested non-core operations, and significantly reduced costs, aligning overheads with revenue. Our heater ink-based technology is now the focus, having delivered successful real-world trials of our heating system and secured the first commercial orders.\nThe strategic transformation is well underway, and while challenges remain, these actions provide a clear path to profitability. We remain committed to delivering value and look forward to further progress.\"\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nSimon Turek, CEO\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt/Edward Whiley, Corporate FinanceAndrew Burdis, ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNotes to Editors\nHaydale is a UK based advanced materials group focused on commercialising its proprietary heating ink-based technology and integrating graphene and other nanomaterials into next-generation industrial applications.

          "full_content": "10 Feb 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 4271W\nHaydale Graphene Industries PLC\n10 February 2025\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU) 596 / 2014 WHICH FORMS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018 (\"MAR\").\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\n('Haydale' or the 'Group')\nHaydale US placed into insolvency process\nAmmanford, 10 February 2025\n- Haydale (AIM: HAYD), the advanced materials group, announces that, further to the Group's announcement of 23 December 2024 regarding the completion of the reconstituted Board's business review, the Board has lodged the necessary filings in court in the state of Georgia (the \"\nCourt\n\") to place its wholly owned subsidiary, Haydale Ceramic Technologies LLC, (\"\nHCT\n\") into a corporate insolvency process under Chapter 11 subchapter V of the United States (\"\nUS\n\") Bankruptcy Code, and a Court hearing is expected to be held over the next few days to consider the commencement of the process.\nUnder the protection of the Chapter 11 subchapter V process, the Group then intends to proceed to file a proposed plan with the Court to sell the assets of HCT through a court supervised process pursuant to section 363 of the US Bankruptcy Code (the \"Plan\") via a public auction. This is seen by management as the best means of realising maximum value for those assets and giving the greatest potential for cash to be returned to Haydale (which has an outstanding intercompany debtor balance within the US sub group of \u00a312.8m to the Group (the \"Intergroup Balance\")) after all liabilities of HCT have been settled, albeit there can be no guarantee of any such outcome. The Group has received several expressions of interest from third party companies that are expected to participate in the process.\nChapter 11 subchapter V is a court-supervised process for small companies that provides protection from pre-existing creditors whilst the sales process is effected. During this process, HCT will remain in possession and control of its assets to allow the business and operations to continue uninterrupted. It is anticipated that HCT will remain in Chapter 11 for a period of up to 90 days; HCT has sufficient access to working capital to fund itself through this process.\nHCT comprises the Group's Silicon Carbide and cutting tool manufacturing facility based in Greer, South Carolina, with sales offices serving the North American, European and East Asian markets. In the Group's results for the year to 30 June 2024 Haydale US generated revenues of \u00a33.3m, making pre-tax losses of \u00a30.8m, and had net liabilities of \u00a34.7m at the same balance sheet date.\nOver the last few years, the Group has strategically repositioned its US operations by expanding focus from silicon carbide (SiC) powder sales to the manufacture and distribution of advanced cutting tools. This transition aimed to enhance value by moving up the supply chain and capitalising on the growing demand in sectors such as aerospace and automotive. Despite these strategic initiatives, the expected growth in the Group's US operations has not materialised. It has become clear to the reconstituted Board that the previous management team's confidence in the US business' ability to convert the pipeline on a timely basis was overly optimistic and not reflective of the Group's operational preparedness or knowledge of market conditions. Despite efforts to improve the performance of the US business, the Board expects HCT to remain loss-making beyond FY25 and has concluded that divestment of the US operations is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In arriving at this decision, the Directors considered other possible scenarios, though concluded that the time required, costs and intervening persistent cash drain on the Group would not be justified.\nThe chosen course of action will significantly reduce overhead costs and operational complexity, contributing to the Group's goal of achieving improved profitability and cash flow in FY25, in order to protect Haydale's core business. Substantial cost savings in FY25 will be realised through the elimination of ongoing operating losses and associated overheads in the US business.\nThe remaining Intergroup Balances and investment not already provided against by Haydale as at 30 June 2024 will be provided against in full in the interim accounts to 31 December 2024.\nFollowing the above process, the sale of the Group's South Korean Subsidiary as announced on 23 December 2024, and the exit from the Thailand operations effected earlier in January 2025, Haydale will comprise the Group's UK based nanomaterials business that facilitates the integration of graphene and other nanomaterials into the next generation of industrial materials and commercial technologies, incorporating Haydale's rich base of c100 patents.\nFurther announcements will be made at the appropriate time.\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nSimon Turek, Ch",

HTK is currently a distributor of Haydale products serving the South-east Asia region.\nAs part of the fundraising announced in October, the Company stated that it would undertake a rigorous review of all aspects of the business with a view to reprioritising those areas offering up near term (as well as long term) profitability, positive cash generation, and other strategic options which align with Haydale's core strengths and accelerate certain commercial activities. One element of this work undertaken immediately by the Board was to review the performance of the overseas entities and potentially dispose of or close them. HTK had been persistently loss-making and a review of its current opportunities and order book has led the Board to conclude that a sale to its local director is appropriate, the associated costs of which are significantly lower than the estimated costs of closure. The sale to Minon Kim also maintains a distribution channel partner in Korea for Haydale products if any of HTK's leads mature going forward.\nThe Disposal was completed for a nominal consideration of \u00a31, plus the write off of remaining inter-company debt owed to Haydale, of c.\u00a30.34m. In the FY to 30 June 2024 HTK made a loss before tax of c.\u00a30.12m and had proforma net liabilities at completion of c.\u00a30.27m. As part of the Disposal Haydale has granted HTK exclusive distribution rights for the supply of its established products in Korea for a period of one year (ending 1 January 2026).\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe sale of HTK and the granting of the exclusive distribution rights to Mingon Kim constitute related party transactions pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules by virtue of Mingon Kim's status as a director of HTK. The directors of Haydale, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Cavendish, consider that the terms of the sale and granting of distributor rights are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's Shareholders are concerned.\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nGareth Kaminski-Cook, Executive Chair Tel: +44 (0) 1269 842946\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt / Edward Whiley / Trisyia Jamaludin, Corporate Finance Tel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nAndrew Burdis, ECM\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Growing interest and participation in these sectors reflect strong demand for Haydale's solutions, validated by direct customer engagement and the Group's own extensive market experience.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Focus:\nThe Board has identified that the Group's efforts and valuable resources are currently spread too thinly, resulting in a diffusion of focus and reduced operational effectiveness. The Group has maintained partnerships that to date have failed to adequately recognise its expertise and value.\nThe Board has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the Group's performance to identify products and services with the highest profitability, growth potential, and strategic importance. The Group's highest potential product and service offerings include those for enabling carbon reduction, including its underfloor heating, printed transfers and carbon capture products and related services. As part of the new strategy, the Group will adopt a more focused and simplified approach, leveraging its leading technology to commercialise these products and services.\nFurthermore, the strategy will target the most profitable customer segments and geographic regions. These selected revenue streams will offer strong diversification across market segments, characterised by robust demand and significant growth potential.\n\u00b7\nCommercialisation:\nThe Group will allocate capital, technological resources and talent towards these priority areas. The UK business has been reorganised to focus primarily on two key business lines: heating ink-based energy efficiency products and carbon capture.\nHeating ink-based energy efficiency products business line\nUnderfloor heating:\nThe Group has successfully completed its first external trial installation with a social housing provider in the Channel Islands and is working with several partners to commercialise the product in the UK, Europe and North America.\nPrinted transfers:\nThe Group's development work with Cadent for portable hot water and radiator products has been successful and we are working to commercialise these products for their estimated 4 million vulnerable customers. Through another strategic partnership the Group is seeking to develop its heating inks into an emergency heating solution for deployment to households in fuel poverty. The Group is working with several potential partners to take these products into parallel leisure markets.\nCarbon capture business line\nThe Group has successfully demonstrated through initial trials that its proprietary technology can enhance the efficiency of existing carbon capture materials. Through a new business line introduced by the reconstituted Board, the Group is working with several potential partners to commercialise its technology in the carbon capture, usage and storage market. Under the UK Labour government, carbon capture and storage are a central component of the nation's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nPartnerships\nThe Group will maintain strategic partnerships with Petronas, Saint Gobain and certain graphene producers, provided that the commercial arrangements appropriately reflect and reward the Group's capabilities. A small portfolio of incubation projects is being maintained where there is a strong economic and strategic rationale.\nSilicon Carbide Tooling\nOver the last few years, the Group has strategically repositioned its US operations by expanding focus from silicon carbide (SiC) powder sales to the manufacture and dist",

This agreement specifies a\nprogressive minimum\nannual financial commitment for the partner to place US$4.0m of orders with Haydale over the duration of the five year deal. The size of the Chinese Silicon Carbide cutting tool market has been estimated at c. US$214 million by 2024 with a compound annual growth rate of 6.2 % (Source: Global Silicon Carbide Fibres Market Report 2021 - 2028, Market Insight Reports).\nUnder the terms of the agreement the Chinese tooling manufacturing company will be the exclusive distributor of Haydale's unique and high-quality silicon carbide tooling into the Chinese market. This partnership is set to enhance the availability and accessibility of these premium materials to a broader range of industries in China, including the aerospace, automotive, and industrial manufacturing sectors.\nImportantly, the agreement will also provide Haydale with exclusive access to their new partner's range of proprietary Carbide and Cermet products for the US and UK markets (although there is no minimum financial commitment set for this element) which, together with another agreement signed earlier this year with a China based Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) tooling manufacturer, will allow Haydale to provide a one stop shop offering to its customers across a wide range of tooling requirements.\nThis landmark deal for Haydale, valued at US$4.0 million over the five years, marks a major milestone in the Company's global expansion strategy, increasing their portfolio of tooling offerings, and promises to bolster the commercial scope and reach of its US-based tooling operation.\nHaydale's CEO, Keith Broadbent, commented:\n\"We are excited to sign this agreement with our Chinese partner to help to bring our innovative silicon carbide cutting tool materials to China and the Asia area. It represents a significant opportunity for us to expand our international footprint and to support the growth of our manufacturing operations in the United States. We look forward to a successful collaboration that will drive value for both companies and our customers.\n\"Haydale's silicon carbide cutting tool materials are renowned for their superior quality and performance, offering enhanced durability, efficiency, and precision for a wide range of applications. The Company's commitment to excellence has positioned it as a trusted supplier in the cutting tool materials market. This new distribution agreement is part of Haydale's strategic plan to increase its presence in key global markets and to leverage new opportunities for growth and development.\"\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nKeith Broadbent, CEO\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nMark Bolt, Sales & Marketing Manager\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt/Edward Whiley, Corporate FinanceAndrew Burdis, ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNotes to Editors\nHaydale is a global technologies group and service provider that facilitates the integration of graphene and other nanomaterials into the next generation of industrial materials and commercial technologies.

In addition,\ncertain sales for Q4 have been impacted by a very short term US supply chain issue that will impact on the Company's SiC whisker production in June, reducing available stock.\nAs high\nvalue specialist commodity products, the sales cycle for tooling is relatively straightforward based on product performance and cost compared with the incumbent product with no obstacles to switching. Whilst Haydale is starting to see good progress with both late stage pipeline and client accounts increasing, the testing cycle is proving to be longer than anticipated. The Company is currently in testing with a number of major potential tooling customers that it anticipates will make a major difference to the business' performance in a relatively short timeframe with progressive improvement expected as they move forwards. Arrangements with our potential Asia based manufacturing and distribution partner, as referred to in the interims statement, have continued to progress positively and the Directors expect these to now close in H1 FY25. These significant opportunities support the anticipated major growth forecast for FY25, after taking account of the latent start. The Directors therefore anticipate forecast expectations for FY25 to still show major growth on FY24, albeit from the lower starting position.\nConversely, the nanomaterial operations centred in the UK have continued to strengthen with continuing growth in the demand for Haydale's functionalisation processes as the industry matures. The Company has seen a continuing stream of projects arising from its existing customer base with major new customers continuing to be added. The Company anticipates these paid for development projects will result in longer term repeat revenues.\nThe Directors expect the general commercial momentum from this Year to continue and accelerate next financial year reflecting building confidence in the medium and long-term prospects and the overall significant potential for the Group\n.\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nKeith Broadbent, CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt/Edward Whiley, Corporate FinanceAndrew Burdis, ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNotes to Editors\nHaydale is a global technologies and materials group that facilitates the integration of graphene and other nanomaterials into the next generation of commercial technologies and industrial materials.

We are also pleased with the continuing development of the prototypes with Cadent and the opportunities that these will bring both commercially and to their vulnerable customers. Our focus on underfloor heating and thermal fluid is a direct support to the wider push for Net Zero, and we continue our progress there with discussion with potential end users underway. Our US business related revenues continue to grow, albeit tooling sales are not responding as quickly as we had planned; we have therefore taken action to reinforce sales resource to drive the planned increase in tooling sales in H2\nwhich we expect to deliver as we move through the rest of FY24\n\".\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nKeith Broadbent, CEO\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt/Edward Whiley, Corporate FinanceAndrew Burdis, ECM\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nNotes to Editors\nHaydale is a global technologies group and service provider that facilitates the integration of graphene and other nanomaterials into the next generation of industrial materials and commercial technologies.

This support will assist in the development and proof of concept of scientific innovations, in a commercial setting.\nHydratech, a division of Liquitherm Technologies Group and longtime manufacturer of aqueous-based heat transfer fluids, have been awarded a collaborative SMART FIS to work in partnership with Haydale on the project.\nBy infusing Hydratech heat transfer fluids with Haydale functionalised graphene, there is potential to maximise thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity, and thus significantly increase the efficiency of all fluid-based heating and cooling systems. The resulting graphene-infused heat transfer fluids would be classified as Fluidstate Superthermal Conductors, or FSC's.\nKey target sectors intended to benefit from FSC, would be those using domestic and commercial heat pumps, including air source, ground source, geothermal and water source. By increasing the Coefficients of Performance of all heat pumps, the associated users - including and especially domestic households - will benefit from much reduced running costs. I.E., smaller heating bills, whilst significantly reducing greenhouse emissions.\nAs part of a new innovation strategy for Wales, aimed at supporting Welsh industry by increased investment in research, development and innovation, the SMART FIS funding will enable both companies to accelerate their development of FSC towards market-ready products, with the project totalling \u00a3147,221 with a grant value of \u00a373,610 shared between the partners.\nStephen Hickson, MD of Hydratech commented:\n\"\nWe are excited to collaborate and partner with Haydale, who bring a unique material solution to industry wide challenges. Our range of heat transfer fluids are already widely used, but the development of a more conductive and thermally efficient fluid will be warmly welcomed by domestic, commercial and industrial users alike, and simultaneously support the drive to Net Zero CO2 by 2050.\"\nKeith Broadbent, CEO of Haydale, commented:\n\"This support from Welsh Government will accelerate the development of our technology and processes, particularly for thermal fluid innovation, where we believe functionalised graphene can pave the way for the next generation of energy-efficient heating, particularly in situations where an air source heat pump\ncan\nbe installed in domestic and commercial properties.\"\nEnds -\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nKeith Broadbent, CEO Tel: +44 (0) 1269 842946\nMark Bolt, Sales & Marketing Manager Tel: +44 (0) 1269 507026\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nJulian Blunt / Edward Whiley, Corporate Finance Tel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nAndrew Burdis, ECM\nNotes to Editors\nHaydale\nis a global technologies and materials group that facilitates the integration of graphene and other nanomaterials into the next generation of commercial technologies and industrial materials.

At a time that seemed opportune to strengthen the company's value by improving the current share price and thereby appease the long-suffering shareholders by presenting positive financial results and driving up the share price, are they embarking on the risky project of asking for yet another sacrifice from the already hard-suffering shareholders? They say this move is to compensate the long-suffering shareholders. I don't agree, with all due respect to the board's decisions.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand.

We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December.

Everyone has their own opinion and way of doing things, and this is mine. And I don't know if the decisions are, or can be, agreed upon with Cavendish, which I assume they are, but in the recent past, fatal mistakes have been made for the development of the business, and although I'm aware of the change in the company's direction, starting with the top executives, the advisors in this case remain the same, which doesn't inspire much confidence. In the transactions handled by the market maker, I've often seen deals that, at the very least, can be described as strange, and I'm not the only person on this forum who has had a negative opinion about this.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

This AI researches multiple analysts simultaneously, which may include those I've researched. Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made.

Until proven otherwise, and there's only one way to do that, which is by presenting the results without the delay that's going to happen in this case, to send positive signals that could help finance the company, whether through the market with options, a share offering, loans, or whatever they deem most appropriate and advantageous. On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly.

At a time that seemed opportune to strengthen the company's value by improving the current share price and thereby appease the long-suffering shareholders by presenting positive financial results and driving up the share price, are they embarking on the risky project of asking for yet another sacrifice from the already hard-suffering shareholders? They say this move is to compensate the long-suffering shareholders. I don't agree, with all due respect to the board's decisions.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand.

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

And I don't know if the decisions are, or can be, agreed upon with Cavendish, which I assume they are, but in the recent past, fatal mistakes have been made for the development of the business, and although I'm aware of the change in the company's direction, starting with the top executives, the advisors in this case remain the same, which doesn't inspire much confidence. In the transactions handled by the market maker, I've often seen deals that, at the very least, can be described as strange, and I'm not the only person on this forum who has had a negative opinion about this.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made.

On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly.

It will be interesting to see who owns how many shares after all the consideration shares are issued in the new year. With regard to the upcoming acquisition, I can see the sense strategically in, basically, buying a route to market for existing just heat applications, allowing the business to focus on other applications - which may prove to be a step change or a damp squib, who knows. My quibble is it seems to be a lot of money  being paid for a loss making SMCC, and I suspect it'll need plenty of work and focus to make this at all profitable. Hope my concern is misplaced.",

At a time that seemed opportune to strengthen the company's value by improving the current share price and thereby appease the long-suffering shareholders by presenting positive financial results and driving up the share price, are they embarking on the risky project of asking for yet another sacrifice from the already hard-suffering shareholders?

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

I believe that they have re-instated forecasts and have a 1p target, which ties in with SMCC's first earnout target of 1.5X the .645p strike price. I would suggest that Barclays will also be confident that this is achievable or they would not have agreed to the deal. YAHOO Finance also appear to have used this research for their SIMPLY Wallstreet AI generated report on Haydale. DYOR",

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made.

On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly.

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made. But that's not in my hands, as I'm just a shareholder who can only offer my opinion",

Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

But I think it would have been necessary to know the company's current state a year after the last general meeting, where the difficult situation the company was going through was clearly explained. Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand. Because it seems that shareholders went into the offer to acquire new shares with enthusiasm, but without real information, and the same mistakes of the past are being repeated, which is why many shareholders are disappointed with the company's performance, especially those who have been invested longer and made disastrous investments.",

From there, we continue moving forward.

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

Errors of this magnitude are how companies end up in bankruptcy. Let's hope that doesn't happen to this company, given its promising future outlook.",

On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly.

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made.

Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand.

In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

At a time that seemed opportune to strengthen the company's value by improving the current share price and thereby appease the long-suffering shareholders by presenting positive financial results and driving up the share price, are they embarking on the risky project of asking for yet another sacrifice from the already hard-suffering shareholders? They say this move is to compensate the long-suffering shareholders. I don't agree, with all due respect to the board's decisions.",

It will be interesting to see who owns how many shares after all the consideration shares are issued in the new year. With regard to the upcoming acquisition, I can see the sense strategically in, basically, buying a route to market for existing just heat applications, allowing the business to focus on other applications - which may prove to be a step change or a damp squib, who knows. My quibble is it seems to be a lot of money  being paid for a loss making SMCC, and I suspect it'll need plenty of work and focus to make this at all profitable. Hope my concern is misplaced.",

On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly. I see too much enthusiasm, which could cause them to lose sight of the real objective.",

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made. But that's not in my hands, as I'm just a shareholder who can only offer my opinion",

Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

And I don't know if the decisions are, or can be, agreed upon with Cavendish, which I assume they are, but in the recent past, fatal mistakes have been made for the development of the business, and although I'm aware of the change in the company's direction, starting with the top executives, the advisors in this case remain the same, which doesn't inspire much confidence.

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

But I think it would have been necessary to know the company's current state a year after the last general meeting, where the difficult situation the company was going through was clearly explained. Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand. Because it seems that shareholders went into the offer to acquire new shares with enthusiasm, but without real information, and the same mistakes of the past are being repeated, which is why many shareholders are disappointed with the company's performance, especially those who have been invested longer and made disastrous investments.",

From there, we continue moving forward.

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

Until proven otherwise, and there's only one way to do that, which is by presenting the results without the delay that's going to happen in this case, to send positive signals that could help finance the company, whether through the market with options, a share offering, loans, or whatever they deem most appropriate and advantageous. On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly.

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made. But that's not in my hands, as I'm just a shareholder who can only offer my opinion",

This AI researches multiple analysts simultaneously, which may include those I've researched. Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand.

But I'm not just referring to the new acquisition; Haydale has had financial problems from the beginning, a decade ago. Now it was starting to recover, after bleeding dry for a long time. First, get your house in order, and then you do whatever else is necessary. Present results, confirm the promised cost reductions, and confirm according to management. From there, we continue moving forward. There's no need to mortgage your resources again if there's no rush, because the company hasn't yet confirmed its good performance with strong financial results, aside from some good news, but without any clear results. The first thing to do is start there, consolidating the foundations, which you don't have.",

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

At a time that seemed opportune to strengthen the company's value by improving the current share price and thereby appease the long-suffering shareholders by presenting positive financial results and driving up the share price, are they embarking on the risky project of asking for yet another sacrifice from the already hard-suffering shareholders? They say this move is to compensate the long-suffering shareholders. I don't agree, with all due respect to the board's decisions.",

It will be interesting to see who owns how many shares after all the consideration shares are issued in the new year. With regard to the upcoming acquisition, I can see the sense strategically in, basically, buying a route to market for existing just heat applications, allowing the business to focus on other applications - which may prove to be a step change or a damp squib, who knows. My quibble is it seems to be a lot of money  being paid for a loss making SMCC, and I suspect it'll need plenty of work and focus to make this at all profitable. Hope my concern is misplaced.",

On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly.

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made.

Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

And I don't know if the decisions are, or can be, agreed upon with Cavendish, which I assume they are, but in the recent past, fatal mistakes have been made for the development of the business, and although I'm aware of the change in the company's direction, starting with the top executives, the advisors in this case remain the same, which doesn't inspire much confidence.

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

But I think it would have been necessary to know the company's current state a year after the last general meeting, where the difficult situation the company was going through was clearly explained. Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand. Because it seems that shareholders went into the offer to acquire new shares with enthusiasm, but without real information, and the same mistakes of the past are being repeated, which is why many shareholders are disappointed with the company's performance, especially those who have been invested longer and made disastrous investments.",

First, get your house in order, and then you do whatever else is necessary. Present results, confirm the promised cost reductions, and confirm according to management. From there, we continue moving forward. There's no need to mortgage your resources again if there's no rush, because the company hasn't yet confirmed its good performance with strong financial results, aside from some good news, but without any clear results.

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly.

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made.

Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times.

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand.

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term. Big dilution sure but if the alternative was a bit of a drift higher followed by weak sales our best case would end up being an unfavourable sale.",

At a time that seemed opportune to strengthen the company's value by improving the current share price and thereby appease the long-suffering shareholders by presenting positive financial results and driving up the share price, are they embarking on the risky project of asking for yet another sacrifice from the already hard-suffering shareholders? They say this move is to compensate the long-suffering shareholders. I don't agree, with all due respect to the board's decisions.",

I was surprised by the euphoria and enthusiasm surrounding the placement and oversubscription of the capital increase. It was completely unnecessary to take that risk, but oh well, now it's time to sell.",

With regard to the upcoming acquisition, I can see the sense strategically in, basically, buying a route to market for existing just heat applications, allowing the business to focus on other applications - which may prove to be a step change or a damp squib, who knows. My quibble is it seems to be a lot of money  being paid for a loss making SMCC, and I suspect it'll need plenty of work and focus to make this at all profitable. Hope my concern is misplaced.",

So what happens when one does a Google search with the terms, \"Nicholas Pritchard Bangor\"? I'll let you do that...",

Until proven otherwise, and there's only one way to do that, which is by presenting the results without the delay that's going to happen in this case, to send positive signals that could help finance the company, whether through the market with options, a share offering, loans, or whatever they deem most appropriate and advantageous. On the other hand, I'm surprised that there has been so much oversubscription by shareholders without having real and properly updated data. It surprises me greatly. I see too much enthusiasm, which could cause them to lose sight of the real objective.",

We shareholders can think or believe things freely, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen, have happened, or be true. And this is also an opinion, my personal one. I also don't believe they're responsible for everything the company might have done wrong, because management will have the final say, regardless of Cavendish's advice, which includes things like changing the name or the management, for example. In any case, I prefer to look to the future rather than the past, hence my concern that things are done right for the future good of the company, and that as few mistakes as possible are made. But that's not in my hands, as I'm just a shareholder who can only offer my opinion",

Regarding Cavendish, I see you have considerable confidence in them for whatever reason, and I have no objection. However, I understand the trades you mentioned they make, as it's normal, especially when a company has such low trading volume. But I'm referring to another type of trade, already discussed in this forum, with specific dates and times. These were instances of stock purchases, without any intervening sales, and instead of the price rising or falling due to supply and demand, it not only didn't rise, it didn't even stay the same, but the stock was sold below the trading price at that moment, inexplicably.",

With regard to your previous post about Cavendish and the Yahoo report, yes Cavendish worked with the previous management, but they also might in their duty to all shareholders have been involved in the management changes, whilst they are paid by Haydale I think they also have fidicuary responsibility to all shareholders. The Yahoo report is AI generated and will have combined all data it can find, but will always give the \"Investment\" warning for all Companies that have prior losses, which is inevitable in new technology companies and is after all why AIM evolved and has its tax breaks. Regarding trading in the market, my hypothesis on how the professionals operate is, imagine you are an ambitious fund manager whose usual investment value would be a multiple of the normal market daily trade value and let us go back a few weeks to when the share price was 0.6p with a spread of 0.55-0.65 and say the size is 1.5m shares bid with one market maker and offered with 2 also 1.5m each, the wise fund manager would instruct his dealer to bid 0.56 for 10m shares with a minimum start size of 3m. If at close of play the dealer or his market maker friend has accumulated 5m shares there will be a load of smaller trades under 0.56 and then the late reporting of the 5m at 0.56 and they will all show as sales or unknown! Also the two market makers who were offering at 0.65  if they had not been involved in the trades they would try and muscle in by lowering their offer prices, to attract the buyer to them. In this scenario buying looks like selling and the price has fallen!! Just my thoughts.",

And I don't know if the decisions are, or can be, agreed upon with Cavendish, which I assume they are, but in the recent past, fatal mistakes have been made for the development of the business, and although I'm aware of the change in the company's direction, starting with the top executives, the advisors in this case remain the same, which doesn't inspire much confidence. In the transactions handled by the market maker, I've often seen deals that, at the very least, can be described as strange, and I'm not the only person on this forum who has had a negative opinion about this.",

While strategic developments and partnerships offer growth potential, financial stability remains a crucial concern. This is what professional market analysts think about the company's latest news. We shareholders can talk, criticize, exchange opinions, think, or believe whatever we want, but without results until February, the market, in its objective analysis, without bias, speculation, or speculation, has already formed its opinion of Haydale. And that could be a heavy burden if the results presented in February aren't satisfactory enough for the market. This is a risk that could have been avoided by presenting results in December. I hope I'm wrong and that in February I have to eat my words; that would be a huge success for all of us who want this company to succeed.",

Well, if things have improved now, even if not dramatically, but the measures they decided to take a year ago have managed to improve things, even if only slightly, it would be fair to say so, just as they bluntly stated last year that things were going badly and outlined the adjustments they had to make. That's fine, we need to be clear and realistic and know where we stand. Because it seems that shareholders went into the offer to acquire new shares with enthusiasm, but without real information, and the same mistakes of the past are being repeated, which is why many shareholders are disappointed with the company's performance, especially those who have been invested longer and made disastrous investments.",

From what I can see, the business has changed very significantly over the past 12 to 15 months - now focussing on commercialising its existing graphene applications, and focussing more on the UK. In so doing it has sharply reduced its cost base and, arguably, improved its chances of success in a (graphene) sector that has seen, let's be honest, much failure and little success. The company we now have doesn't seem to have the structure that could drive incremental growth in fragmented sectors (like housing), and hence the acquisition of SMCC seems sensible - to provide such a structure. The price tag still seems high, but fingers crossed it will succeed. From a shareholding perspective I think this makes Haydale a less speculative punt (though still speculative to a degree) with a greater chance of incremental (but less spectacular) success. I imagine that will please some shareholders and not others. And of course they can still develop other commercial applications that might be more spectacularly successful. Let's hope so.",

Without an integrated distribution method sales of Justheat could well have been looking to underperform. In theory this acquisition will help us hit the ground running. The fact that its loss making isn\u2019t too relevant as it had been aggressively growing to establish itself in the sector which in theory we can now capitalise on. Becoming profitable may still be some time off but growing revenues will bolster the share price in the medium term.

At a time that seemed opportune to strengthen the company's value by improving the current share price and thereby appease the long-suffering shareholders by presenting positive financial results and driving up the share price, are they embarking on the risky project of asking for yet another sacrifice from the already hard-suffering shareholders? They say this move is to compensate the long-suffering shareholders. I don't agree, with all due respect to the board's decisions.",
