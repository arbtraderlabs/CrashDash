All conditions to completion have now been satisfied, including the associated fundraising, shareholder approvals and admissions of new shares. SMCC is now fully part of the Haydale Group.\nFundraising\nIn connection with the Acquisition, the Company has completed a fundraising, with gross proceeds raised of approximately \u00a35.75m.\nSubscriptions were made by an array of investors including Haydale's existing key strategic investor Quidos Technologies Limited (which is owned by the CEO, Simon Turek, and long-time strategic investor Nick Pritchard), SMCC's existing key strategic investor Barclays, tax efficient EIS investors as well as Mark Sait, Chief Commercial Officer of the enlarged Group and CEO of SMCC, and Theresa Wallis, Non-Executive Director.\nThe participation of senior management and strategic partners strongly aligns interests with shareholders and underlines confidence in the enlarged Group's strategy. The Company also notes that demand for the retail offer exceeded available shares, reflecting strong investor support for both the Acquisition and Haydale's strategic direction.\nStrategic Rationale and Value Creation\nThe completion of this Acquisition marks a step-change in Haydale's evolution, accelerating its transition from advanced materials innovator to a commercially scalable, graphene-enabled clean-technology platform with immediate market access.\nAs previously outlined, SMCC brings substantial and highly complementary strategic benefits:\nA national, nil-cost customer acquisition engine\nSMCC's Impact Partner Programme embeds its Sustainability Hub directly into the client offerings of major UK banks and utilities, including Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and Wave Utilities. These partners fund the platform in return for verified ESG and carbon data and actively refer their customers to SMCC as part of their own Net Zero, lending and efficiency programmes. As a result, SMCC generates a continuous flow of pre-qualified B2B opportunities at effectively zero marginal acquisition cost, eliminating traditional sales and marketing spend while delivering a scalable, partner-funded route-to-market for Haydale's graphene-enabled technologies.\nA proven B2B delivery platform at scale\nThe Acquisition adds an established end-to-end commercial capability covering ESG advisory, audits, design, financing support, installation and ongoing service delivery. SMCC has a strong track record of executing complex energy and water-efficiency projects across the UK, materially strengthening Haydale's ability to convert technology into revenue.\nRapid deployment of graphene-enabled products\nSMCC provides a ready-made route to market for Haydale's proprietary technologies, most notably JustHeat, the Company's graphene-based heating system, alongside future graphene-enhanced products. In parallel, Haydale's technology materially enhances SMCC's offering, enabling clients to adopt deeper, more cost-effective decarbonisation solutions.\nTogether, the enlarged Group is now exceptionally well positioned to address accelerating demand for practical, investable decarbonisation in the built environment. Haydale's advanced materials and product innovation, combined with SMCC's market access and execution capability, creates a vertically integrated clean-tech platform capable of delivering measurable carbon, energy and water savings at scale.\nIntegration and Next Steps\nIntegration of SMCC into the Group is now underway. SMCC will continue to operate its successful Impact Partner Programme and client services, now supported by Haydale's technology portfolio and balance sheet.\nJustHeat will be incorporated immediately into SMCC's solution set, creating near-term cross-selling opportunities across SMCC's existing and future customer pipeline. The Board expects this to accelerate commercial traction and shorten sales cycles.\nAs part of the transaction, Mark Sait, co-founder and CEO of SMCC, has joined the Board of Haydale as an Executive Director and assumes the role of Chief Commercial Officer of the enlarged Group. Mark and the SMCC management team bring deep sector expertise and a strong commercial track record, and will work closely with Haydale's leadership to drive integration and growth.\nThe Board believes the combined leadership team, broadened talent base and enhanced route-to-market place Haydale in a strong position to execute its growth strategy.\nAnnual Results\nFollowing the change of accounting reference date announced on 12 December 2025, the Company looks forward to announcing audited final results for the fifteen months to 30 September 2025 during the early part of February 2026. Whilst these results will not include any impact of the acquisition of SMCC they will provide management with an opportunity to update shareholders further as regards commercial progress and the integration of SMCC.\nChange of name\nThe proposed change of name of the Company to Haydale plc is expected to become effective shortly. A further announcement will be made once this is effective.\nSimon Turek, Chief Executive Officer of Haydale, commented:\n\"Completing the acquisition of SaveMoneyCutCarbon is a pivotal milestone for Haydale. Over the past year we have reshaped the Company into a focused, commercially driven business with graphene-enabled technologies ready for scale.\nBy combining our advanced materials expertise and JustHeat technology with SMCC's nationwide market-access engine and delivery capability, we have created a scalable clean-tech platform designed to deploy energy and water-efficiency solutions at pace and with real impact.\nThe enlarged Group is uniquely positioned to help organisations cut energy and water costs while materially reducing carbon emissions. I am delighted to welcome Mark and the SMCC team to Haydale as we enter the next phase of growth together.\"\nFor further information:\nHaydale Graphene Industries plc\nTel: +44 (0) 1269 842 946\nSimon Turek, CEO\nPatrick Carter, CFO\nwww.haydale.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nJulian Blunt / Edward Whiley / Trisyia Jamaludin, Corporate Finance\nAndrew Burdis, ECM\nAbout Haydale\nHaydale is an advanced materials and clean-tech company focused on developing and deploying energy and water-efficient technologies at scale.
