Within this, direct revenues\n1\ndecreased 0.8% year-on-year, with growth in diversified revenues offset by the weaker environment continuing across our local markets. Indirect revenues\n1\nincreased 4.0%, due to strong growth in off-platform revenues, which more than offset the softer performance of our volume-sensitive on-platform programmatic advertising. Throughout the quarter we saw lower digital referral volumes, particularly from Google. As a result, page views, a measure of on-platform audience volumes, fell 1% over the nine-month period.\nIn Print, circulation revenues remain a reliable and predictable revenue stream, with our publications offering stand-out market deals to our readers. Print advertising revenue continues to perform above circulation volume declines.\nRestructure to deliver our priorities for growth\nWe have restructured the Group to align with our three key priorities to accelerate growth. As part of this we have created new roles and teams which will focus on increasing our video production, developing new commercial propositions, and driving growth in off-platform audiences. We will also see some people leaving the business. The full year restructuring cost is estimated to be c.\u00a320m.\nOutlook\nWe remain confident about our future, with three clear priorities and are encouraged by our progress against these. Profit expectations are well underpinned by the resilient print performance and disciplined cost management, and we are on track to deliver our 4-5% cost saving target. We anticipate full year digital revenues to be broadly flat on the prior year, reflecting the ongoing volatility in referral volumes and weak macroeconomic backdrop. We remain confident in delivering market expectations for the year.\n2\nPiers North, Chief Executive:\n\"We delivered a good financial performance despite continued volatility in referral volume and we made strong progress across our strategic priorities; including the creation of new video teams in the newsrooms, new video launches such as the Daily Expresso and All Out Football, and an increase in branded video revenue.\n\"We also delivered continued success in our diversified revenues including the OK! Beauty Box and are now working at pace on further initiatives, launching our digital subscriptions pilot in the coming weeks.\"\nNotes:\n1\nDirect revenues:\nAdvertising or commercial revenues that are generated from direct engagement with the advertiser, agency or consumer. The material areas include direct advertising, agency and our B2B offering Mantis. A subset of direct is\ndiversified revenues\nwhich includes subscriptions, affiliates, ecommerce and partnerships.\nIndirect revenues\n: Advertising or commercial revenues that are generated indirectly such as revenue on social platforms (off-platform) or programmatically on owned and operated websites (on-platform).\n2\nMarket expectations\ncompiled by the Company are an average of analyst published forecasts - consensus adjusted operating profit for FY25 \u00a399.1m.\n3\nReach plc full year results will be reported Tuesday 3 March 2026.\nEnquiries\nReach\ncommunications@reachplc.com\nPiers North, Chief Executive Officer\nLija Kresowaty, External Communications\nJo Britten, Investor Relations\n+44 (0)7557 557447\nTeneo\nreachplc@teneo.com\nGiles Kernick\n+44 (0)207 353 4200\nAbout Reach\nWe're Reach plc, the UK and Ireland's largest commercial news publisher.

Year-on-year page views grew 9% and this supported the strong performance across our programmatic advertising. Data-driven revenue has had a softer start to the year to make up 43% of digital revenues. This is attributable to the strong prior year performance and a weaker local advertising market.\nIn Print, circulation revenues remain a predictable and reliable revenue stream with the expected volume decline mitigated by actions on cover prices, one-off specials and promotional activity. Print advertising performed ahead of the decline in circulation volumes.\nWe remain confident in delivering the reduction in operating costs of 4-5%, in line with previous guidance.\nOutlook\nWe have started 2025 in line with our expectations. Whilst there are no immediate direct impacts from the recent tariff announcements we recognise the heightened levels of macroeconomic uncertainty. We remain on track to deliver in line with market expectations for the full year.\n1\nPiers North,\nChief Executive\n\"While I've been with Reach for over a decade, I've enjoyed spending much of the past month speaking with more people across the company and gaining a deeper understanding of our opportunities.\nWe remain focused on delivering our plans, supported by impactful journalism that continues to attract a growing audience - a trend that gained momentum at the end of 2024.\nWhile we can't ignore the current market uncertainty, we're pleased with the progress we're making and believe there's significant opportunity ahead.

As previously communicated, advertisers brought some of their spend forward to June and July to align with key events, including the European Football Championships. Our Customer Value Strategy is driving higher levels of data-driven revenues which creates more valuable advertising for our partners. Data-driven revenues grew 10% and now represent 46% of digital revenues (FY23: 43%).\nIn Print, circulation revenues remain predictable, with the teams managing cover price increases alongside strong promotional activity to mitigate the volume headwinds. Print advertising revenue continues to outperform volume declines, bolstered by demand from retailers.\nOutlook\nWe remain confident in delivering expectations for the full year2. We continue to monitor the impact from the tech platforms' actions on referral volumes, and we expect further digital growth in Q4. We remain focused on costs and we are tracking slightly ahead of the 5-6% cost saving target we set at the start of the year.\nJim Mullen,\nChief Executive\n\"Our Customer Value Strategy continues to drive revenue diversification and has helped us navigate the dynamic media backdrop. We continue to make good progress with our investments including our US expansion, the re-platforming of our websites and our in-house ad tech platform, Mantis.\nWhile the quarter saw big news events such as the Olympics and developments in the US elections, it also highlighted the importance of trusted news sources to responsibly report on tragic events such as in Southport, especially in the wake of disinformation and social unrest.\"\nNotes:\n1\nThe results have been prepared for the 3 month period ending 30 September 2024 and the comparative period has been prepared for the 3 month period to 24 September 2023. There is one additional trading day within the 3 month and 9 month period. No adjustment has been made for this.\n2\nMarket expectations compiled by the Company are an average of analyst published forecasts - consensus adjusted operating profit for FY24 \u00a397.7m.\n3\nAs a reminder the comparative periods for Q423 and FY23 will include an additional trading week compared to Q424 and FY24. The like-for-like results will also be disclosed at the Full year results on Tuesday 4 March 2025.\nEnquiries\nReach\nJim Mullen, Chief Executive Officer\nLija Kresowaty, External Communications\ncommunications@reachplc.com\nJo Britten, Investor Relations\n+44 (0)7557 557447\nTeneo\nreachplc@teneo.com\nDavid Allchurch/Giles Kernick\n+44 (0)207 353 4200\nAbout Reach\nWe're Reach plc, the UK's and Ireland's largest commercial news publisher.

These revenues now represent 45% of total digital revenues (HY23: 41%).\n\u00b7\nStrong trading of digital assets, along with continued diversification into non-advertising revenues, including partnerships, ecommerce and affiliates.

Trends are improving and open market prices for mass scale programmatic advertising have stabilised.\nFY24 Outlook: On track to deliver market expectations\nWe remain focused on delivering our operational plans for the year as we build a more sustainable digital business. Our Customer Value Strategy is continuing to grow data-driven revenues and we expect our print performance to remain resilient despite the tough macro backdrop.\nWe are trending slightly ahead of a full year reduction in operating costs of 5-6%. The phasing of cost initiatives and inflation during 2023 and 2024 means that operating profits will be more equally weighted between the first and second half of the year.\nAt the end of the period, we saw elevated levels of advertising spend supported by events such as the European Football Championships. July is trading in line with our expectations.\nWe continue to work against the backdrop of the dominant tech platforms and their impact on search and referral traffic. As we have seen, this dynamic can create some volatility across our distribution, however, we are building more resilience through our Customer Value Strategy and we remain on track to deliver market expectations.(6)\nQ2 Trading: Digital revenue back in growth\n2024\nQ1 YOY\n%\nQ2 YOY\n%\nHY YOY\n%\nDigital revenue\n(8.5)\n6.7\n(1.3)\nPrint revenue\n(6.0)\n(6.2)\n(6.1)\ncirculation revenue\n(3.4)\n(3.7)\n(3.6)\nadvertising revenue\n(10.7)\n(12.3)\n(11.5)\nGroup revenue\n(6.7)\n(3.6)\n(5.2)\nThe performance over the second quarter has been bolstered by strong multi-platform content around key events, including the European Football Championships, UK general election and Taylor Swift Eras tour. As expected, yield continued to improve, driving growth across the digital estate. We remain focused on optimising our digital inventory with the increase in yield more than compensating for the 16% decline in page views.\nData-driven revenues, which are higher value and enable more targeted advertising, now make up 45% of digital revenues. Across the quarter these revenues grew 13% (year-on-year) due to the strong growth in direct advertising revenues and non-advertising revenues, including partnerships, ecommerce and affiliates.\nMass-scale programmatic advertising market has benefitted from a stab",

These include the well publicised deprioritisation of news during 2023 by major platforms which meant that year-on-year page views declined 33%. This has been partially offset by the strengthening yield per page.\nData-driven revenue, which makes up our Customer Value Strategy,1 and is higher value and more targeted, continues to perform strongly, growing over the period to make-up 45% of digital revenues (Q123: 39%). The growth was driven by a combination of non-advertising revenues including partnerships, ecommerce and affiliates and directly sold advertising.\nIn Print, circulation revenues remain a predictable and reliable revenue stream with the expected volume decline mitigated by actions on cover prices and availability. Print advertising revenue outperformed volume trends due to higher spend levels from advertisers.\nCost savings\nWith the cost reduction programmes implemented, we are confident in delivering the reduction in operating costs of 5-6% in line with previous guidance.\nOutlook\nThe year-on-year reduction in referral traffic from the major platforms will lessen as we progress through the year. Trading remains robust in what is a challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver full year expectations.2\nJim Mullen, Reach plc Chief Executive\n\"We have set the business up to succeed - the decision to take cost action early, alongside the continued implementation of the Customer Value Strategy is delivering a growing yield performance and driving results. This gives me confidence that we can continue to navigate current market conditions. With events like the European Football Championships, Olympics and elections round the corner we have the opportunity to generate high levels of interest by entertaining and informing our audiences with brilliant journalism.\"\nNotes\n1\nIncludes revenue from advertising activity which utilises data generated via registrations, audience behavioural or Mantis contextual. It also includes other strategically driven revenues, less dependent on audience volumes such as affiliates, partnerships and ecommerce.\n2\nMarket expectations compiled by the Company are an average of analyst published forecasts - consensus adjusted operating profit for FY24 \u00a397.6m.\nEnquiries\nReach\ncommunications@reachplc.com\nJim Mullen, Chief Executive Officer\nDarren Fisher\n, Chief Financial Officer\nLaura Harris, Group Company Secretary\nLija Kresowaty, Head of External Communications\nJo Britten, Investor Relations Director\njo.britten@reachplc.com\n+44 (0)7557 557447\nTeneo\nreachplc@teneo.com\nDavid Allchurch/Giles Kernick\n+44 (0)207 353 4200\nAbout Reach\nWe're Reach plc, the UK's and Ireland's largest commercial news publisher.

With the end of these issues in sight, we have significantly reduced our obligations and have a clear path forward for the business.\n\"The success of our strategy also came to the fore this year. Despite the macroeconomic pressures, we have continued to build a stronger digital business with an increasing portion of much higher yielding revenues, reducing our reliance on the open market. At the same time, we have expertly managed our print business, maintaining circulation revenues as well as delivering necessary cost and efficiency plans across the Group.\n\"Together, all of these actions have put our business in a stronger position, so that we can continue to deliver great content to our audiences as well as returns for our shareholders.\"\nCapital allocation priorities unchanged with commitments unwinding\n\u00b7\nAfter a number of years, the 2019 and 2022 Pension Triennial valuations are concluded. There is an agreed pathway to fully funding the schemes and from 2028 pension commitments are expected to reduce by c.\u00a340m\n(1)\n\u00b7\nDecember's High Court judgment provides a resolution on time limitation for Historical Legal Issues. This means that a significant number of outstanding claims can be resolved, and this should largely bring an end to future claims. The expected cost of settling has reduced by \u00a320.2m\n\u00b7\nContinued strategic investment with a focus on digital capabilities, digital infrastructure and the US operations, including the launch of Mirror and Express '.com' websites\n\u00b7\nFinal \u00a37.0m deferred consideration in respect of the Express & Star acquisition has been paid\n\u00b7\nFull year dividend maintained at 7.34p reflecting the Board's confidence in the business model and understanding of the importance of dividends to shareholders\nResults overview\nData-led outperformance improves digital revenue resilience despite sector decline in page views\nFinancial Summary(2)\n53 weeks to 31 Dec 2023\nAdjusted results(3)\nStatutory results\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nRevenue\n\u00a3m\n568.6\n601.4\n(5.4)%\n568.6\n601.4\n(5.4)%\nOperating profit\n\u00a3m\n96.5\n106.1\n(9.0)%\n46.1\n71.3\n(35.3)%\nOperating profit margin\n%\n17.0%\n17.6%\n(0.6)%\n8.1 %\n11.9%\n(3.8)%\nEarnings per share\nPence\n21.8\n27.1\n6.8\n16.8\nNet (debt)/cash (4)\n\u00a3m\n(10.1)\n25.4\n(10.1)\n25.4\nDividend per share(5)\nPence\n7.34\n7.34\n7.34\n7.34\n\u00b7\nRevenue declined 5.4% to \u00a3568.6m, Print revenue of \u00a3438.8m (FY22: \u00a3448.6m) down 2% and Digital revenue of \u00a3127.4m (FY22: \u00a3149.8m) down 15%\n\u00b7\nStrong print circulation performance \u00a3312.5m (FY22: \u00a3307.7m) - revenue up by 2% and volumes in line with our historical print volumes.

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

These gains are driven by improved content quality and increased Google Search visibility. For FUTR, a Press Gazette article from May 7 highlighted a substantial visibility boost for Tech Radar, a major player in Future's portfolio, which saw its Sistrix Visibility Score soar by 45% from March 5 - April 19. This trend is mirrored across Future's other properties, with Tom\u2019s Guide and PC Gamer also enjoying notable increases. Additionally, for RCH, titles such as Mirror and various regional publications are seeing significant upward momentum, further underscoring the broad-based recovery in the advertising market. Both companies are in Sharewatch's Growth Portfolio 3 and have gained around 40% since the start of the year. Future's and Reach's Strategic Shift to Higher Yield Ads We see further upside from a continued mix shift towards higher yielding direct Ad sales. Both companies have demonstrated some traction here. Direct Ads offer a 4x higher yield vs open auction. We see room for growth and margin expansion, aided by improvements in content quality. Stay tuned for more updates as the market continues to rebound, driving forward industry leaders like Reach and Future. This weekend's issue will have another company in a similar space, which we think could do really well. PLUS two other ideas. We're so excited that this issue has been pulled forward by a week. Show it to the angry poster on A....FM. a right t%#t",

I wish many other businesses would have done the same before  simply going bust leaving shareholders worthless. But how many more years of cost cutting can they still achieve while the print business decline continues? On a slight positive they do have loads of brands and titles so perhaps they could be sold off in pieces to stay somewhat comfortably  alive. I thought  the biggest liability prior was the pension scheme which should have been sorted following the recent interest rate hikes on gilts, though not fully kept up here as I always held it for just a short trade which luckily turned out well a few times. Just might get caught out if I try again?  Would love for this to be a longer term growth story though.",

My understanding is that the underfunding of the pension scheme is largely resolved and no longer a drag on cash. I also noticed that they recently renewed a big distribution contract with Smiths News through to 2029 - surely a positive if it's priced correctly. One of my shares (TIG ) received a takeover proposal today. Hopefully that's a sign of something starting in 2025.",

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

Why can't Reach set up a platform ??  They have a huge pool of potential customers and advertising options galore, why don't they use them ?

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

These gains are driven by improved content quality and increased Google Search visibility. For FUTR, a Press Gazette article from May 7 highlighted a substantial visibility boost for Tech Radar, a major player in Future's portfolio, which saw its Sistrix Visibility Score soar by 45% from March 5 - April 19. This trend is mirrored across Future's other properties, with Tom\u2019s Guide and PC Gamer also enjoying notable increases. Additionally, for RCH, titles such as Mirror and various regional publications are seeing significant upward momentum, further underscoring the broad-based recovery in the advertising market. Both companies are in Sharewatch's Growth Portfolio 3 and have gained around 40% since the start of the year. Future's and Reach's Strategic Shift to Higher Yield Ads We see further upside from a continued mix shift towards higher yielding direct Ad sales. Both companies have demonstrated some traction here. Direct Ads offer a 4x higher yield vs open auction. We see room for growth and margin expansion, aided by improvements in content quality. Stay tuned for more updates as the market continues to rebound, driving forward industry leaders like Reach and Future. This weekend's issue will have another company in a similar space, which we think could do really well. PLUS two other ideas. We're so excited that this issue has been pulled forward by a week.

I wish many other businesses would have done the same before  simply going bust leaving shareholders worthless. But how many more years of cost cutting can they still achieve while the print business decline continues? On a slight positive they do have loads of brands and titles so perhaps they could be sold off in pieces to stay somewhat comfortably  alive. I thought  the biggest liability prior was the pension scheme which should have been sorted following the recent interest rate hikes on gilts, though not fully kept up here as I always held it for just a short trade which luckily turned out well a few times. Just might get caught out if I try again?  Would love for this to be a longer term growth story though.",

I also noticed that they recently renewed a big distribution contract with Smiths News through to 2029 - surely a positive if it's priced correctly.

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

On the other hand a new system or technology might come along and siphon off viewers and advertising revenue, so stymieing the business model. Who knows? Feels like a bit of a punt.

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

That\u2019s the exact technical regime RCH has been in before its previous big upside legs. The key trigger is a proper break and hold above the falling trendline and 200-day MA. If/when that goes, the chart flips from \u201cspeculative base\u201d to \u201ctrend attempt\u201d and historically that\u2019s where fast repricing moves start. Above there, there\u2019s very little real structure until the 80s, and then the big historical supply zone in the 90\u2013100p area. DYOR",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",

Too many companies cut costs when it's already too late but here they've been pretty relentless with cutting staff numbers. Although dread to think what morale must be like for those who remain.",

The decline of print media  meant everything hinged on digital but that too has had a couple of hammer blows. First was social media algo changes, particularly Facebook that overnight stopped diverting meaningful traffic to news sites. Second the rise of AI means any old idiot can set up endless websites or apps and churn out infinite articles about any subject, so it has become a race to the bottom competing for traffic. Reach being lowbrow means they don't have the same sort of inbuilt defence proper publications like FT or Guardian have. Latest hammer blow for all publishers is google AI summaries now rapidly reducing need to click through to separate websites. The more sophisticated AI gets the more integrated with the apps it becomes, creating a bit of a doom loop as with less traffic they serve fewer advertisers generating less revenue.",

So, to use a phrase employed by a well known commentator, RCH could be viewed as a 'melting iceberg'.  If this is correct, then the next question is 'how fast is it melting'.  And that's the main point on which buyers and sellers disagree.  With a high yield and the possibility of an even higher yield from the full payment of pension deficits that happens next year, then I am tentatively with the buyers. Hope this makes sense.",
