This approach has the potential to significantly reduce AI operating costs for businesses and improve performance for a wide range of applications.\nThe Company will update the market on events to include technical development and testing and outreach to early users and partners.\nPart Two below sets out the technical benefits and background as to why the Company believes this new subset represents a substantial long-term growth opportunity.\nRevenue\u00a0will be based on successful take-up and will be in the form of Tiger's Alpha Token.\n\"We are encouraged by the steady progress of the KDN-1 subnet and are pleased to confirm that it is on track for full operational launch in Q1 2026. This marks a key milestone for Tiger Alpha as we continue to build practical, revenue-generating infrastructure within the Bittensor ecosystem. The Company believes KDN-1 will support long-term growth as demand for efficient AI solutions continues to rise.\"\nJonathan Bixby CEO\nFor further information please contact:\nTiger Alpha Plc\nJonathan Bixby\n+44 (0) 20 7581 4477\nBeaumont Cornish (Nomad)\nRoland Cornish & Felicity Geidt\n+44 (0) 20 7628 3369\nFortified Securities\n(Broker)\nGuy Wheatley\nEmail:\nguy.wheatley@fortifiedsecurities.com\n+44 (0) 7493 989014\nNovum Securities\n(Broker)\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (\"Beaumont Cornish\") is the Company's Nominated Adviser and is authorised and regulated by the FCA. Beaumont Cornish's responsibilities as the Company's Nominated Adviser, including a responsibility to advise and guide the Company on its responsibilities under the AIM Rules for Companies and AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers, are owed solely to the London Stock Exchange. Beaumont Cornish is not acting for and will not be responsible to any other persons for providing protections afforded to customers of Beaumont Cornish nor for advising them in relation to the proposed arrangements described in this announcement or any matter referred to in it.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation 2014/596/EU\u00a0as it forms part of the UK\u00a0law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018\nPART TWO\nTechnical Benefits:\u00a0Cost Cutting and Reduced Latency\nAI inference, the process of running a trained model to generate output (such as answers, predictions, or classification) in response to user queries or new data, is currently expensive because models continually reprocess the same documents, queries, and content. KDN-1 helps to solve this industry-wide issue.\nCost Reduction\nBy re-using previously processed information, KDN-1 can theoretically:\n\u00b7\nLower AI compute costs for businesses by\n50-80%\n\u00b7\nReduce the amount of GPU time needed for common tasks\n\u00b7\nEnable organisations to run more AI workloads without increasing budget\nFor many companies, AI cost is becoming a major operational expense. KDN-1 directly addresses this challenge.\nLatency Reduction\nLatency is the time delay between a user making a request and the AI system delivering a usable response but with users increasingly expecting real-time interactions with AI.\nKDN-1 can theoretically improve performance by:\n\u00b7\nReducing \"time to first answer\" by\n5-10\u00d7\n\u00b7\nMaking AI chatbots and search tools feel instant\n\u00b7\nSupporting more interactive and responsive applications\nFast, inexpensive AI is crucial for mainstream adoption, and KDN-1 aims to deliver both.\nMarket Overview and Growth Potential\nThe AI Market\nThe global AI market is expanding rapidly, with industry forecasts projecting spending to reach\nhundreds of billions of dollars\nover the coming years. A significant portion of this spending is on cloud-based compute for operating large language models (LLMs).\nAs AI adoption continues to accelerate, the need for cost-efficient and scalable infrastructure becomes increasingly important. KDN-1 aims to position Tiger Alpha within this fast-growing segment.\nThe CDN Analogy\nContent Delivery Networks (CDNs) transformed the internet by storing and delivering commonly used content quickly and efficiently. Today, the CDN industry is worth\nover $20-30 billion annually\n.\nKDN-1 applies this same principle to AI:\ninstead of caching images and webpages, it caches AI knowledge.\nThis creates the opportunity for a new, AI-focused infrastructure market that could grow alongside - or even outpace - traditional CDNs as model usage becomes central to every digital product.\nLong-Term Potential\nIf knowledge caching becomes a standard part of AI deployment (as CDNs became for websites), KDN-1 could ultimately support:\n\u00b7\nLarge enterprise AI systems\n\u00b7\nGlobal consumer applications\n\u00b7\nAI search, assistants, and agent workflows\n\u00b7\nHigh-volume AI services across multiple industries\n.\nAbout Tiger Alpha PLC\nTiger Alpha PLC (formerly\nTiger Royalties and Investments PLC\n) is an AIM traded investment vehicle focused on incubating high-growth technology and mining ventures. High-growth technology focuses\u00a0on frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, decentralized infrastructure, and digital asset networks. The Company's strategy centres on building long-term value through participation in distributed computing, liquidity, and data networks.\nFollowing the acquisition of Bixby Technology Inc. in early 2025, the Company will focus on identifying technology enterprises to invest in and incubate by providing incubation services and strategic guidance to technology entrepreneurs whilst continuing in its existing investing policy of identifying and investing in the global natural resources sector.\nBixby Technology Inc. will be focused on targeting new fast-growth technology products and projects, these may include equity, securities, meme coins and other form of beneficial interests or digital assets.\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://www.tigerinvests.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company has initially allocated \u00a3250,000 towards the Strategy and technical implementation is expected to begin in Q4 2025, with early yield and participation metrics to be reported in the Company's year-end update.\nBackground\nStaking refers to the process by which participants lock digital assets within a blockchain protocol to secure the network, validate transactions, and earn yield or governance rights in return. It underpins most proof-of-stake and delegated consensus systems, aligning network security with participant incentives.\nOn the HYPE network, staking extends beyond traditional security provision. Participants stake assets to supply liquidity, support trading depth, and govern protocol parameters, effectively powering the decentralized exchange itself. This structure allows stakers to share in transaction fees and yield streams generated by market activity, aligning liquidity provision with network value creation.\nHyperliquid is a next-generation, fully on-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to deliver institutional-grade trading performance within a permissionless environment. Operating as a Layer-1 blockchain with native order book infrastructure, Hyperliquid enables high-speed, transparent derivatives and spot trading without intermediaries. Participants provide liquidity, secure the network through staking, and earn HYPE tokens proportional to their contribution to market depth, governance, and trading activity.\nRationale for Strategy\nThis initiative complements the Company's Bittensor subnets, most recently announced on 30 June 2025, deepening Tiger Alpha's commitment to investing in core infrastructure across decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) and finance.\nBuilding on the Company's growing investment presence within the Bittensor ecosystem, the Strategy as described above has been designed to establish to complement the Bittensor strategy by building an addiontal flexible, staking framework across select decentralized liquidity protocols.\nImplementation of the Strategy\nThe Company's initial plan is to acquire HYPE tokens and stake them on a third party staking service. The expected staking return fluctuates and is based on the amount of HYPE staked with rewards decreasing as more tokens are staked. The return has fluctuated over time but based on recent data it is around 2.27% to 4.50% annually. The Company can elect to re-stake the rewarded HYPE or to convert the HYPE to fiat at any time.\nJonathan Bixby, Chief Executive Officer of Tiger Alpha PLC, commented:\n\"The launch of our staking strategy on\nHYPE\nmarks a pivotal evolution in Tiger Alpha's journey. Our dedicated Tao subnets established Tiger Alpha as a public gateway into decentralized artificial intelligence - this new strategy into\nHYPE\nexpands that vision into decentralized liquidity. If Tao represents the\nintelligence layer\nof the decentralized economy, then HYPE represents its\nliquidity layer\n- the neural bloodstream that enables intelligence, computation, and value to move and compound across digital networks.By combining AI computation with on-chain capital efficiency, we are building a foundation that mirrors the dual structure of the internet itself: intelligence and liquidity, working in concert. We believe this positions Tiger Alpha uniquely at the convergence of two of the most transformative forces in the digital economy.\"\nAbout Tiger Alpha PLC\nTiger Alpha PLC (formerly\nTiger Royalties and Investments PLC\n) is an AIM traded\ninvestment vehicle focused on incubating high-growth technology and mining ventures.

          "content": "28 Sep 2023 11:28\nRNS Number : 0225O\nTiger Royalties and Investments PLC\n28 September 2023\nFor immediate release 28 September 2023\nTIGER ROYALTIES AND INVESTMENTS PLC (\"Tiger\" or the \"Company\")\nUNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2023\nChairman's Report\nDear Shareholder,\nNet Asset Value per share - 30 Jun 2023: 0. 05p / 31 Dec 2022: 0.09p (30 June 2022: 0.12p )\nTotal net assets - 30 Jun 2023: \u00a3248k / 31 Dec 2022: \u00a3496k (30 June 2022: \u00a3542k)\nIn my last Chairman's report, I made modestly upbeat comments about the changing mood of smaller company investors moving into 2023 and beyond. However, I am disappointed to note that this assessment did not materialise in the way I had envisaged at the time and that in fact the micro-cap company investor arena has deteriorated significantly since that time and the outlook remains somewhat uncertain.\nThe period under review has suffered from what is probably one of the worst market scenarios I have witnessed during my years in the natural resource sector. This is of course compounded by the fact that there is a preference of investors to invest directly into individual companies as opposed to deploying funds in umbrella investment companies and hence interest in smaller cap funds has waned.\nConsequently, we are pleased that we elected some years ago to be more proactive and develop positions where we had some influence in the underlying investee company's strategy alongside holding a relatively larger equity position in these types of investments. Whilst this has provided a more focused portfolio of assets, value is yet to be recognised given the gloomy state of the market for junior mining and commodity stocks. We remain optimistic on some of the investments held in the portfolio and I feel that in some cases fundamentals significantly outweigh current stock market values and, when sentiment returns, we will see the fundamental strength of these underlying assets.\nWe live in a very uncertain world with unprecedented financial and geopolitical headwinds, exacerbated by new media and extreme political manoeuvring predominantly resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. During violent times, alliances and allegiances can be transient, thus not helping the confidence and certainty that is sought by the investing community, a trait that is needed to promote stronger junior resource markets.\nThe major markets however seem to be holding their own, despite the negative global pressures, although there a reasonable amount of volatility. Share prices of the major mining and energy producers have certainly come off their highs, as seen post the initial Covid market rally.\nWe remain confident on the fundamentals for base metals, particularly for copper and battery metals. We also remain confident of an emergence of third world and developing economies where disposable income is increasing and the thirst to have white goods, cars, and mobile gadgets continues at a rapid pace, pointing to increasing demand for these goods and hence for materials in the foreseeable future. The supply side for copper is becoming dismal and I firmly believe that any junior mining companies fortunate enough to have near production assets in their portfolios will become very valuable investments in the next two to three years. If the major mining companies are slow in acquiring these types of companies, then family offices and perhaps the motor industry will look at building positions in junior commodity companies with quality assets, the latter grouping in order to secure their supply lines for the rapidly developing EV market.\nTo summarise, in contrast to the aforementioned concerns, we firmly believe, more than ever, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that a commodity boom cycle revolution is in the making. The Company's management team will continue to seek out positions and investments where the underlying assets are well positioned and there is scope for value add and we strongly believe that such opportunities will emerge as a result of the changing economic conditions.\nThis has been our strategy for some years, and it is our hope and belief that we will see significant upside in the portfolio value over the next 12 months.\nColin Bird\nChairman\n28 September 2023\nPortfolio Holdings as at 30 June 2023\nInvestments\nNumber of shares\nCost\n\u00a3\nValuation at 30 June 2023

Basis of preparation\nThese interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared by applying the accounting policies adopted in the audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 and should be read in conjunction with the 2022 annual report. As permitted, the Company has chosen not to adopt IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\".\nThe financial information set out in this interim report does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The statutory financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2022, were prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\n2.

Dividends\nNo dividends were declared during the period under review (30 June 2022: nil).\n4. Current liabilities\nThe current liability figure of \u00a3246,516 (2022: \u00a3140,758) includes an accrual of \u00a3108,628 (2022:\n\u00a368,934 ) - relating to Directors' salaries/fees for 12 months ended 30 June 2023. The current liability figure also includes a creditor of \u00a396,000 (2022:\u00a333,000) payable to Lion Mining Finance, which is a related party.\n5. Deferred Tax\nA deferred tax asset on revaluation of investments arose during the period. However, deferred tax assets are not recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams arising from the disposal of investments held by the Company. Losses may be carried forward indefinitely and will only be recoverable if suitable profits arise in the future.\n6. Called Up Share Capital\nThe share capital of Tiger Royalties and Investments Plc consists only of fully paid ordinary shares with a nominal value of 0.1p each. All Ordinary shares are equally eligible to receive dividends and the repayment of capital and represent one vote at the shareholders' meeting of the Company.\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n30 June 2023\n30 June 2022\n31 December 2022\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAuthorised:\n10,000,000,000 (30 June 2022 & 31 December 2022: 10,000,000,000) Ordinary shares 0.1p (30 June 2022 & 31 December 2022 - 0.1p each)\n10,000,000\n10,000,000\n10,000,000\n142,831,939 deferred shares of 0.9p each (30 June 2022 & 31 December 2022: 142,831,939 Deferred shares of 0.9p each)\n1,285,487\n1,285,487\n1,285,487\nIssued:\nOpening Ordinary shares - 539,628,553 shares of 0.1p each (30 June 2022 & 31 December 2022: 447,942,308 Ordinary Shares of 0.1p each)\n539,629\n447,943\n447,943\nNew shares issued:\n91,686,246 shares at issue price of \u00a30.002 (nominal value of 0.1p each)\n-\n-\n91,686\nTotal ordinary shares in issue at period end 539,628,553 Ordinary shares 0.1p (30 June 2022 : 447,942,308 Ordinary shares of 0.1 p & 31 December 2022: 539,628,553 Ordinary shares of 0.1 p)\n539,629\n447,943\n539,629\n142,831,939 deferred shares of 0.9p each (30 June 2022 & 31 December 2022: 142,831,939 deferred shares of 0.9p each)\n1,285,487\n1,285,487\n1,285,487\n1,825,116\n1,733,430\n1,825,116\nIncluded in allotted called and fully paid share capital are 4,500,000 shares with a nominal value of \u00a34,500 held by the company in treasury.\n7. Share Warrants\nAt the period end, and as at 31 December 2022, the Company had the following warrants outstanding:\nIssue date\nNumber of warrants\nExercise price\nShare price at issue date\nSubscription price at issue date\n20 December 2022\n91,686,246\n0.3p\n0.225p\n0.2p\nThere were no warrants outstanding on 30 June 2022\n8. Going concern\nThe operations of the Company have been financed mainly through operating cash flows. As at 30 June 2023, the Company held cash balances of \u00a369,874 (30 June 2022: \u00a310,424) and an operating loss has been reported for the 6 months ended 30 June 2023. Historically, the Company has generated cash flow from the sale of investments in quoted natural resource companies. The Company's financial investments at 30 June 2023 were \u00a3404,862. It is possible, as a result of volatile markets, that the Company may need to raise funding to provide additional working capital to finance its ongoing activities. The management team has successfully raised funding for similar projects and companies in the past although there is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed in the future.\nBased on its current reserves and the Board's assessment that the Company should be able to raise additional funds when required to meet its working capital requirements, the Board has concluded that it has a reasonable expectation that the Company can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Board confirms that Directors' fees will continue to accrue or be paid in shares (subject to AIM rules and other regulatory issues) until the Company undertakes either a fundraise and has sufficient excess working capital to settle such fees, or is involved in a significant transaction which would significantly uplift the prospects for the Company. For these reasons, the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business.\n9. Post-reporting date\nNo adjusting or significant non-adjusting events have occurred between the reporting date and the date of release of the Company's interim financials.\n10. Availability of Interim Report\nA copy of these interim results will be available from the Company's registered office during normal business hours on any weekday at 2nd Floor, 7/8 Kendrick Mews, London SW7 3HG, and can also be downloaded from the Company's website at http://www.tiger-rf.com/.
