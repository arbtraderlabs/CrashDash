This approach has the potential to significantly reduce AI operating costs for businesses and improve performance for a wide range of applications.\nThe Company will update the market on events to include technical development and testing and outreach to early users and partners.\nPart Two below sets out the technical benefits and background as to why the Company believes this new subset represents a substantial long-term growth opportunity.\nRevenue\u00a0will be based on successful take-up and will be in the form of Tiger's Alpha Token.\n\"We are encouraged by the steady progress of the KDN-1 subnet and are pleased to confirm that it is on track for full operational launch in Q1 2026. This marks a key milestone for Tiger Alpha as we continue to build practical, revenue-generating infrastructure within the Bittensor ecosystem. The Company believes KDN-1 will support long-term growth as demand for efficient AI solutions continues to rise.\"\nJonathan Bixby CEO\nFor further information please contact:\nTiger Alpha Plc\nJonathan Bixby\n+44 (0) 20 7581 4477\nBeaumont Cornish (Nomad)\nRoland Cornish & Felicity Geidt\n+44 (0) 20 7628 3369\nFortified Securities\n(Broker)\nGuy Wheatley\nEmail:\nguy.wheatley@fortifiedsecurities.com\n+44 (0) 7493 989014\nNovum Securities\n(Broker)\nJon Belliss\n+44 (0) 20 7399 9425\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (\"Beaumont Cornish\") is the Company's Nominated Adviser and is authorised and regulated by the FCA. Beaumont Cornish's responsibilities as the Company's Nominated Adviser, including a responsibility to advise and guide the Company on its responsibilities under the AIM Rules for Companies and AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers, are owed solely to the London Stock Exchange. Beaumont Cornish is not acting for and will not be responsible to any other persons for providing protections afforded to customers of Beaumont Cornish nor for advising them in relation to the proposed arrangements described in this announcement or any matter referred to in it.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation 2014/596/EU\u00a0as it forms part of the UK\u00a0law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018\nPART TWO\nTechnical Benefits:\u00a0Cost Cutting and Reduced Latency\nAI inference, the process of running a trained model to generate output (such as answers, predictions, or classification) in response to user queries or new data, is currently expensive because models continually reprocess the same documents, queries, and content. KDN-1 helps to solve this industry-wide issue.\nCost Reduction\nBy re-using previously processed information, KDN-1 can theoretically:\n\u00b7\nLower AI compute costs for businesses by\n50-80%\n\u00b7\nReduce the amount of GPU time needed for common tasks\n\u00b7\nEnable organisations to run more AI workloads without increasing budget\nFor many companies, AI cost is becoming a major operational expense. KDN-1 directly addresses this challenge.\nLatency Reduction\nLatency is the time delay between a user making a request and the AI system delivering a usable response but with users increasingly expecting real-time interactions with AI.\nKDN-1 can theoretically improve performance by:\n\u00b7\nReducing \"time to first answer\" by\n5-10\u00d7\n\u00b7\nMaking AI chatbots and search tools feel instant\n\u00b7\nSupporting more interactive and responsive applications\nFast, inexpensive AI is crucial for mainstream adoption, and KDN-1 aims to deliver both.\nMarket Overview and Growth Potential\nThe AI Market\nThe global AI market is expanding rapidly, with industry forecasts projecting spending to reach\nhundreds of billions of dollars\nover the coming years. A significant portion of this spending is on cloud-based compute for operating large language models (LLMs).\nAs AI adoption continues to accelerate, the need for cost-efficient and scalable infrastructure becomes increasingly important. KDN-1 aims to position Tiger Alpha within this fast-growing segment.\nThe CDN Analogy\nContent Delivery Networks (CDNs) transformed the internet by storing and delivering commonly used content quickly and efficiently. Today, the CDN industry is worth\nover $20-30 billion annually\n.\nKDN-1 applies this same principle to AI:\ninstead of caching images and webpages, it caches AI knowledge.\nThis creates the opportunity for a new, AI-focused infrastructure market that could grow alongside - or even outpace - traditional CDNs as model usage becomes central to every digital product.\nLong-Term Potential\nIf knowledge caching becomes a standard part of AI deployment (as CDNs became for websites), KDN-1 could ultimately support:\n\u00b7\nLarge enterprise AI systems\n\u00b7\nGlobal consumer applications\n\u00b7\nAI search, assistants, and agent workflows\n\u00b7\nHigh-volume AI services across multiple industries\n.\nAbout Tiger Alpha PLC\nTiger Alpha PLC (formerly\nTiger Royalties and Investments PLC\n) is an AIM traded investment vehicle focused on incubating high-growth technology and mining ventures. High-growth technology focuses\u00a0on frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, decentralized infrastructure, and digital asset networks.

The Company has initially allocated \u00a3250,000 towards the Strategy and technical implementation is expected to begin in Q4 2025, with early yield and participation metrics to be reported in the Company's year-end update.\nBackground\nStaking refers to the process by which participants lock digital assets within a blockchain protocol to secure the network, validate transactions, and earn yield or governance rights in return. It underpins most proof-of-stake and delegated consensus systems, aligning network security with participant incentives.\nOn the HYPE network, staking extends beyond traditional security provision. Participants stake assets to supply liquidity, support trading depth, and govern protocol parameters, effectively powering the decentralized exchange itself. This structure allows stakers to share in transaction fees and yield streams generated by market activity, aligning liquidity provision with network value creation.\nHyperliquid is a next-generation, fully on-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to deliver institutional-grade trading performance within a permissionless environment. Operating as a Layer-1 blockchain with native order book infrastructure, Hyperliquid enables high-speed, transparent derivatives and spot trading without intermediaries. Participants provide liquidity, secure the network through staking, and earn HYPE tokens proportional to their contribution to market depth, governance, and trading activity.\nRationale for Strategy\nThis initiative complements the Company's Bittensor subnets, most recently announced on 30 June 2025, deepening Tiger Alpha's commitment to investing in core infrastructure across decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) and finance.\nBuilding on the Company's growing investment presence within the Bittensor ecosystem, the Strategy as described above has been designed to establish to complement the Bittensor strategy by building an addiontal flexible, staking framework across select decentralized liquidity protocols.\nImplementation of the Strategy\nThe Company's initial plan is to acquire HYPE tokens and stake them on a third party staking service. The expected staking return fluctuates and is based on the amount of HYPE staked with rewards decreasing as more tokens are staked. The return has fluctuated over time but based on recent data it is around 2.27% to 4.50% annually. The Company can elect to re-stake the rewarded HYPE or to convert the HYPE to fiat at any time.\nJonathan Bixby, Chief Executive Officer of Tiger Alpha PLC, commented:\n\"The launch of our staking strategy on\nHYPE\nmarks a pivotal evolution in Tiger Alpha's journey. Our dedicated Tao subnets established Tiger Alpha as a public gateway into decentralized artificial intelligence - this new strategy into\nHYPE\nexpands that vision into decentralized liquidity. If Tao represents the\nintelligence layer\nof the decentralized economy, then HYPE represents its\nliquidity layer\n- the neural bloodstream that enables intelligence, computation, and value to move and compound across digital networks.By combining AI computation with on-chain capital efficiency, we are building a foundation that mirrors the dual structure of the internet itself: intelligence and liquidity, working in concert. We believe this positions Tiger Alpha uniquely at the convergence of two of the most transformative forces in the digital economy.\"\nAbout Tiger Alpha PLC\nTiger Alpha PLC (formerly\nTiger Royalties and Investments PLC\n) is an AIM traded\ninvestment vehicle focused on incubating high-growth technology and mining ventures.

Our focus has remained on positioning the Company, with\u00a0shares trading on AIM, a market regulated by the London Stock Exchange with\nTIDM - TIR,\nwithin areas of high growth potential, particularly in technology, artificial intelligence, and blockchain infrastructure, while maintaining sound governance and prudent capital discipline.\nDuring the period, we advanced a number of new investments that reinforce our thematic priorities with a total of \u00a3837,567 being invested. These included strategic commitments to Satsuma Technology, Standard Strategies, and AROK.VC, alongside the completion of our transaction with Tao Strategies. We also expanded our presence in the Bittensor ecosystem, securing a second subnet and strengthening our operational capabilities in decentralised AI infrastructure. Collectively, these developments reflect our determination to build a diversified portfolio aligned with structural shifts in global markets.\nOur legacy mineral assets remain and we have made no further investment in this sector.\nAt the corporate level, we implemented board changes to support our evolving mandate, executed governance measures around voting rights and share capital, and formalised option arrangements in line with market practice. Our name change and updated communications platform underline Tiger's evolution into a forward-looking investment company, responsive to new opportunities while mindful of shareholder value.\nThe outlook for the remainder of the year is one of cautious optimism. Market conditions remain uncertain, yet the areas in which we are investing continue to attract growing interest and demonstrate long-term promise. We will continue to balance innovation with discipline, nurturing early-stage opportunities while remaining focused on financial resilience and clear exit strategies.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued confidence and support. We believe that the foundations laid during 2025 position Tiger for further progress and sustainable value creation in the years ahead.\nJonathan Bixby\nChief Executive Officer\nFor further information, please contact:\nTiger Alphaplc Jonathan Bixby\n+44 (0) 20 7581 4477\nBeaumont Cornish (Nominated Adviser) Roland Cornish/Felicity Geidt\n+44 (0) 20 7628 3369\nFortified Securities (Broker) Guy Wheatley +44 (0) 7493 989014\nEmail:\nguy.wheatley@fortifiedsecurities.com\nNovum Securities (Broker) Jon Bellis +44 (0) 7399 9425\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (\"Beaumont Cornish\") is the Company's Nominated Adviser and is authorised and regulated by the FCA.\nBeaumont Cornish's responsibilities as the Company's Nominated Adviser, including a responsibility to advise and guide the\nCompany on its responsibilities under the AIM Rules for Companies and AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers, are owed solely to the\nLondon Stock Exchange.

In line with IFRS requirements, only consolidated results are presented; company-only financial statements are not required at the interim stage. Parent company financial statements will be presented in the Company's annual report for the year ending 31 December 2025, as required by the Companies Act 2006.\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the 2024 annual financial statements, except for the adoption of any new standards or interpretations effective in the current period. Management has reviewed these new pronouncements and concluded that they have not had a material impact on the Group's results for the period.\nThe \ufb01nancial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 and for the six months ended 30 June 2024 have neither been audited nor reviewed by the Company's auditors. The comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024 has been derived from the audited financial statements for that period.\n2.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.\nActual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing\nbasis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any\nperiods that will materially affect the accuracy of the financial statements. The areas involving a higher degree of\njudgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, have been disclosed in the last financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThere are no additional judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n3.\nAcquisition of Bixby Technology Inc.\nOn 9 January 2025, the Group completed the acquisition of Bixby Technology Inc. for a total consideration of \u00a3325,000. The consideration was satisfied through the issue of 325,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each in Tiger Investments plc, subscribed for by Toro Consulting Ltd under a set-off arrangement. Accordingly, no cash consideration was paid.\nAccounting treatment\nManagement has assessed the transaction under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'. Bixby did not meet the definition of a business at the acquisition date, as it had no processes or outputs capable of generating returns. Accordingly, the transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition:\n\u2022 The consideration of \u00a3325,000 has been recognised as an investment in subsidiary in the Company's parent-only accounts.\n\u2022 On consolidation, the \u00a3325,000 investment has been reclassified to an intangible asset representing platform rights and incubation capabilities (Refer to Note 5).\n\u2022 No goodwill has been recognised.\n4.\nLoss per ordinary share\nThe basic and diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding treasury shares.
