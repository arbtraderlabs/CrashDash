We therefore hope that as many shareholders as possible attend the AGM.\nVoting at the AGM\nIf you are unable to attend the AGM in person, I would urge you to fill in the proxy form and return it to the Registrar as detailed in note 8, appoint your proxy electronically as detailed in note 9 or, if you are a CREST member, appoint your proxy through the CREST proxy\nappointment service as detailed in note 10. Please ensure your proxy is appointed with voting instructions, to ensure your vote is counted. The deadline for the receipt by our Registrars of all proxy appointments is 48 hours (excluding any UK non-working days) before the time appointed for holding the meeting.\nResolutions\nPlease carefully consider the attached Resolutions 1 to 9 (\"\nResolutions\n\"). Resolutions 1 to 8 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions. This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. Resolution 9 will be proposed as a special resolution. This means that for Resolution 9 to be passed, at least three quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.\nPlease find an explanation of each of the resolutions below:\nResolution 1 - Accounts and Financial Statements\nResolution 1 proposes the receipt of the audited accounts and financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2023, together with the directors' and auditors' reports.\nResolution 2 - Directors' Remuneration Report\nResolution 2 seeks approval by shareholders of the directors' remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 2023. The Directors' Remuneration Report is set out on pages 16 to 17 of the Company's Annual Report and Accounts.\nResolution 3 - Directors' Remuneration Policy\nResolution 3 seeks approval by shareholders of the directors' remuneration policy, which, if approved, would take effect immediately after the end of the AGM. The Directors' Remuneration Policy is set out on page 16 of the Company's Annual Report and Accounts.\nResolution 4 - Reappointment of Auditor\nThe reappointment of Shipleys LLP as auditors of the Company, having been appointed by the Directors on 21 November 2022. The directors recommend Shipleys LLP are reappointed.\nResolution 5 - Remuneration of Auditor\nResolution 5 seeks authority for the Directors to fix the remuneration of Shipleys LLP as auditor of the Company.\nResolutions 6 and 7 - Re-appointment of Directors\nThe Board considers it appropriate in accordance with the principles of good corporate governance for each of the directors to stand for re-appointment. Resolution 6 proposes the re-appointment of Mandhir Singh and resolution 7 proposes the re-appointment of Glyn Foster Roberts. The Board recommends that each of the directors is re-appointed.\nResolution 8 - Directors' authority to allot shares\nResolution 8 is proposed to provide the directors with the authority to allot shares of up to a maximum nominal value of \u00a319,621 (representing approximately 25% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital) in relation to a pre-emptive rights issue and with authority to allot shares of up to a maximum nominal value of \u00a319,621 (representing approximately 25% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital) in any other case. Relevant Securities allotted under one of those authorities will reduce the number of ordinary shares which can be issued under the other. The authorities sought in resolution 8 at the AGM will expire upon the earlier of the end of the next Annual General Meeting, and 28 February 2025.\nResolution 9 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights\nUnder section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"\nAct\n\"), if the Directors wish to allot any shares or grant rights over shares (other than pursuant to an employee share scheme) they must in the first instance offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings. There may be occasions, however, when the Directors need the flexibility to finance business opportunities by the issue of shares for cash without a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders. This cannot be done under the Act unless the shareholders have first waived their pre-emption rights. Resolution 9 authorises the dis-application of pre-emption rights on these actions up to an aggregate nominal value of \u00a319,621. The authority sought in resolution 9 at the AGM will expire on the earlier of the end of the next Annual General Meeting, and 28 February 2025.\nResolutions 8 and 9 would, if passed, give the Directors the power to take advantage of funding (including, without limitation, the reduction of external borrowing) and/or acquisition opportunities as and when they arise, without the need to refer further to shareholders.\nRecommendation\nThe Directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.

Only those shareholders registered in the Company's register of members at:\n- no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting; or\n- if this meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding of the adjourned meeting (the times exclude non-working days),\nshall be entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. Changes to the register of members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.\nInformation regarding the meeting available on website\n2. Information regarding the meeting, including the information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, can be found at.\nAttending the meeting\n3. If you wish to attend the meeting in person, please notify the Company Secretary by email at groberts@wildcatpetroleum.co.uk, so that appropriate arrangements can be made for the number of shareholders seeking to attend the AGM in person. Please make this notification no later than 48 hours (excluding any UK non-working days) before the meeting.\nOn the date of the AGM, please arrive at least 30 minutes in advance of the time appointed for holding the AGM (or if this meeting is adjourned, at least 30 minutes in advance of the time appointed for holding of the adjourned AGM), so that your entitlement to attend and vote at the AGM can be verified against the Company's Register of Members.\nAppointment of proxies\n4. If you are a shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting, you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of your rights at the meeting and you should have received a proxy form with this notice of meeting. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.\n5. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, please contact the Registrar at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen B62 8HD or via info@nevilleregistrars.co.uk. You will need to state clearly on each proxy form the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed.\n6. Shareholders can:\n- Appoint a proxy or proxies and give proxy instructions by returning the enclosed proxy form by post (see note 8).\n- Register their proxy appointment electronically (see note 9).\n- If a CREST member, register their proxy appointment by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service (see note 10).\n- Appoint multiple proxies by notifying the Registrar (see note 5).\n7. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If you either select the \"Discretionary\" option or if no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.\nAppointment of proxy by post\n8. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.\nTo appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:\n- completed and signed;\n- sent or delivered to the Registrar at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen B62 8HD; and\n- received by the Registrar no later than 48 hours\n(excluding any UK non-working days)\nbefore the time appointed for holding the meeting, or, in the event of an adjournment of the meeting, 48 hours\n(excluding any UK non-working days)\nbefore the adjourned meeting.\nIn the case of a shareholder which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company.\nAny power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the proxy form.\nIf you have not received a proxy form and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional proxy forms, please contact the Registrar.\nAppointment of proxies electronically\n9. As an alternative to completing the hard-copy proxy form, you can appoint a proxy electronically by returning the form by email to the Registrar at info@nevilleregistrars.co.uk. For an electronic proxy appointment to be valid, your appointment must be received by the Registrar no later than 48 hours\n(excluding any UK non-working days)\nbefore the time appointed for holding the meeting, or, in the event of an adjournment of the meeting, 48 hours\n(excluding any UK non-working days)\nbefore the adjourned meeting.\nAppointment of proxies through CREST\n10. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.\nFor a proxy appointment or instructions made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a\nCREST Proxy Instruction\n) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Registrar (ID 7RA11) no later than 48 hours\n(excluding any UK non-working days)\nbefore the time appointed for holding the meeting, or, in the event of an adjournment of the meeting, 48 hours\n(excluding any UK non-working days)\nbefore the adjourned meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.\nCREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.\nThe Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.\nAppointment of proxy by joint members\n11. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders completes a proxy appointment, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).\nChanging proxy instructions\n12. Shareholders may change proxy instructions by submitting a new proxy appointment. Note that the cut-off time for receipt of proxy appointments also applies in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.\nWhere you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, please contact the Registrar at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen B62 8HD or by email at info@nevilleregistrars.co.uk.\nIf you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.\nTermination of proxy appointment\n13. A shareholder may terminate a proxy instruction but to do so you will need to inform the Company in writing by either:\n- Sending a signed hard-copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to the Registrar at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen B62 8HD. In the case of a shareholder which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the revocation notice; or\n- Sending an email to the Registrar at info@nevilleregistrars.co.uk, clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment.\nIn either case, the revocation notice must be received by the Registrar no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting, or, in the event of an adjournment of the meeting, 48 hours\n(excluding any UK non-working days)\nbefore the adjourned meeting.\nIf you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified, your original proxy appointment will remain valid.\nAppointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.\nCorporate representatives\n14. A corporation that is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a shareholder provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.\nIssued shares and total voting rights\n15. As at 6:00pm on November 14, 2023 (the latest practicable date before publication of this notice), the Company's issued share capital consists of 2,803,040,000 ordinary shares of 0.00028p each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 6:00pm on November 14, 2023 is 2,803,040,000\nIt is proposed that all votes on the Resolutions at the AGM will be taken by way of a poll. On a vote by poll, every ordinary shareholder has one vote for every ordinary share held.\nQuestions at the meeting\n16. We will be offering shareholders the opportunity to submit questions in advance of the meeting. Please submit any question that you wish to put to the Directors, to groberts@wildcatpetroleum.co.uk. Responses to such questions will be posted on the Company's website following the meeting.\nThe question facility will not constitute attendance or participation on the part of the shareholder in the legal proceedings of the meeting. Questions may also be posed during the meeting as and when the Chair indicates.\nAny shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. If multiple questions on the same topic are received in advance, the Chair may choose to provide a single answer to address shareholder queries on the same topic.\nThe Company must answer any question you ask relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting unless:\n- Answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information.\n- The answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question.\n- It is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.\nIf you attend the meeting in person, you may be included in the recording of the meeting. Please note that this recording is solely for the purposes of creating a transcript of the meeting and will not be publicly available.\nNominated persons\n17. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraph 4 does not apply to nominated persons. The rights described in this paragraph can only be exercised by the shareholders of the Company. If you are a person who has been nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (\"\nNominated Person\n\"):\n- You may have a right under an agreement between you and the shareholder of the Company who has nominated you to have information rights (\"\nRelevant Shareholder\n\") to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the meeting.\n- If you either do not have such a right or if you have such a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right under an agreement between you and the Relevant Shareholder to give instructions to the Relevant Shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.\n- Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the Company remains the Relevant Shareholder (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from you.\nVoting\n18. Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders' votes are counted according to the number of shares registered in their names.\nOn arrival at the AGM venue, all those entitled to vote will be required to register and collect a poll card. In order to facilitate these arrangements, please arrive at the AGM venue in good time. You will be given instructions on how to complete your poll card at the AGM.\nAs soon as practicable following the meeting, the results of the voting will be announced via a regulatory information service and posted on the Company's website.\nCommunication\n19. Except as provided above, shareholders who have general queries about the meeting should send an email, setting out any queries to groberts@wildcatpetroleum.co.uk (no other methods of communication will be accepted).\nYou may not use any electronic address provided either:\n- in this notice; or\n- any related documents (including the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2023 and proxy form),\nto communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.\n20.

This may include webcasts, photos, recordings and audio and video links, as well as other forms of personal data, including your name and contact details.
