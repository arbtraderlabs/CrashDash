UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN]\n14 January 2026\nTruetide plc\n(\"\nTruetide\n\" the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nInvestment update - Paraytec\nTruetide (AIM: TRUE) announces an update on one of its investee companies, Paraytec Limited (\"\nParaytec\n\"). Truetide has a 100% interest in Paraytec.\nParaytec has initiated a focused development program to establish a high-throughput, real-time fluorescent assay for alpha-synuclein fibril formation using the CX300 detection system.\nAlpha-synuclein aggregation is widely regarded as the central pathological process in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Despite intensive industry efforts, no disease-modifying therapy has yet reached the market, in part due to the absence of robust, rapid and cost-effective screening tools capable of identifying molecules that prevent or reverse pathological aggregation.\nThe planned work comprises:\n\u00b7\nproduction and purification of recombinant wild-type and selected pathogenic mutant alpha-synuclein proteins;\n\u00b7\noptimisation of site-specific fluorescent labelling compatible with real-time measurement on the CX300 instrument;\n\u00b7\nfull validation of the assay across multiple alpha-synuclein variants; and\n\u00b7\npreparation of a technical methods paper and presentation at leading international synucleinopathy conferences in 2026, supported by collaboration with Professor Oliver Bandmann (Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SiTRAN)).\nIn the event of a successful completion, Paraytec expects to possess a proprietary, accurate, rapid and low-cost assay that is currently unavailable from any commercial source in a format optimised for the CX300 platform. The directors of Paraytec believe that this assay has the potential to become a preferred screening tool for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies active in the synucleinopathy field.\nThe combination of high sensitivity, real-time kinetics, and low sample consumption positions the CX300 system to capture meaningful market share in what is a multi-billion-dollar drug discovery segment. Initial commercialisation routes under active consideration include reagent kit sales, fee-for-service screening and strategic partnerships with instrument vendors and therapeutic developers.\nThe Board of Truetide views this investment by Paraytec as a high-return opportunity to establish clear technical differentiation for the CX300 platform in one of the most commercially attractive areas of neurodegenerative disease research.\nA further announcement will be made upon completion of the program and publication of the validation data.\nTrevor Brown, CEO of Truetide, commented:\n\"Paraytec remains close to making the scientific and commercial breakthrough via its CX300 technology, that the directors of Truetide hope for. Although somewhat protracted, the development work for a rapid Gram test continues, this new program to establish a high-throughput, real-time fluorescent assay for alpha-synuclein fibril formation significantly increases Paraytec's exposure to the possibility of eventual commercialisation of the CX300.\"\nTruetide plc\nTel: 01738 587555\nTrevor Brown, Chief Executive Officer\nViv Hallam, Executive Director\nAllenby Capital Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nJames Reeve / Ashur Joseph\nAlbR Capital Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7469 0936\nDuncan Vasey\u00a0/\u00a0Lucy Williams\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
