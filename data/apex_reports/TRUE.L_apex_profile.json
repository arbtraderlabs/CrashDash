UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN]\n14 January 2026\nTruetide plc\n(\"\nTruetide\n\" the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nInvestment update - Paraytec\nTruetide (AIM: TRUE) announces an update on one of its investee companies, Paraytec Limited (\"\nParaytec\n\"). Truetide has a 100% interest in Paraytec.\nParaytec has initiated a focused development program to establish a high-throughput, real-time fluorescent assay for alpha-synuclein fibril formation using the CX300 detection system.\nAlpha-synuclein aggregation is widely regarded as the central pathological process in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Despite intensive industry efforts, no disease-modifying therapy has yet reached the market, in part due to the absence of robust, rapid and cost-effective screening tools capable of identifying molecules that prevent or reverse pathological aggregation.\nThe planned work comprises:\n\u00b7\nproduction and purification of recombinant wild-type and selected pathogenic mutant alpha-synuclein proteins;\n\u00b7\noptimisation of site-specific fluorescent labelling compatible with real-time measurement on the CX300 instrument;\n\u00b7\nfull validation of the assay across multiple alpha-synuclein variants; and\n\u00b7\npreparation of a technical methods paper and presentation at leading international synucleinopathy conferences in 2026, supported by collaboration with Professor Oliver Bandmann (Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SiTRAN)).\nIn the event of a successful completion, Paraytec expects to possess a proprietary, accurate, rapid and low-cost assay that is currently unavailable from any commercial source in a format optimised for the CX300 platform. The directors of Paraytec believe that this assay has the potential to become a preferred screening tool for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies active in the synucleinopathy field.\nThe combination of high sensitivity, real-time kinetics, and low sample consumption positions the CX300 system to capture meaningful market share in what is a multi-billion-dollar drug discovery segment. Initial commercialisation routes under active consideration include reagent kit sales, fee-for-service screening and strategic partnerships with instrument vendors and therapeutic developers.\nThe Board of Truetide views this investment by Paraytec as a high-return opportunity to establish clear technical differentiation for the CX300 platform in one of the most commercially attractive areas of neurodegenerative disease research.\nA further announcement will be made upon completion of the program and publication of the validation data.\nTrevor Brown, CEO of Truetide, commented:\n\"Paraytec remains close to making the scientific and commercial breakthrough via its CX300 technology, that the directors of Truetide hope for. Although somewhat protracted, the development work for a rapid Gram test continues, this new program to establish a high-throughput, real-time fluorescent assay for alpha-synuclein fibril formation significantly increases Paraytec's exposure to the possibility of eventual commercialisation of the CX300.\"\nTruetide plc\nTel: 01738 587555\nTrevor Brown, Chief Executive Officer\nViv Hallam, Executive Director\nAllenby Capital Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nJames Reeve / Ashur Joseph\nAlbR Capital Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7469 0936\nDuncan Vasey\u00a0/\u00a0Lucy Williams\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Progress has continued in activities of the Group's portfolio companies and summaries of their operations follow later in this report.\nFinancial Review\nThe Directors have undertaken an unaudited interim review of the valuations of the Group's investments and have concluded that, as at 30 September 2025, the fair value of the Group's investments were as follows:\n\u00b7\nValuation of Portfolio Investments: \u00a30 (31 March 2024: \u00a339,000)*\n\u00b7\nValuation of unconsolidated Strategic Investments: \u00a32,543,000 (31 March 2025: \u00a32,271,000)**\n* these are the historic investments made by Truetide plc up to 2015\n** these are the new investments made by Truetide plc since 2015\nTherefore, the total unaudited value of our unconsolidated investment portfolio as at 30 September 2025 is \u00a32,543,000 (31 March 2025: \u00a32,271,000). As at 30 September 2024, the comparable total valuation of our investments was \u00a32,349,000.\nThe net asset value (\"NAV\") of the Company was \u00a32.7 million as at 30 September 2025 (30 September 2024: \u00a33.4 million, 31 March 2025: \u00a32.3 million).\nThe Group reports a profit after tax for the period under review of \u00a3129,000 (September 2024: \u00a343,000 profit). This equates to a profit per share of 0.16 pence (September 2024: profit per share of 0.07 pence).\nDuring the period, the Company raised gross proceeds of \u00a3295k by way of a placing and broker option.\nStrategic Investments Overview\nParaytec Limited\nhttps://www.paraytec.com/\n(Truetide owns 100% per cent of the company)\n- Book value \u00a3Nil\nTechnology\nParaytec designs advanced detectors for analytical and life science markets. Their main product, the CX300, is a portable flow cytometer that detects particles from 10 nm to 20 \u00b5m in small liquid samples with high sensitivity.\nCommercial Progress\nAnalytik Limited is the commercial partner for Paraytec's particle analysis instruments, managing UK marketing, sales, and support for the CX300 within academic and industrial research labs and promoting at scientific conferences. A key area for use is in extracellular vesicle (EV) characterisation, a fast-growing research area with applications in diagnostics, drug development and regenerative medicine.\nParaytec is developing a two-colour instrument enabling simultaneous analysis of different particle populations, expanding its potential uses in biomedical and research fields. The first production batch is being tested with university partners.\nGyrometric Systems Limited\nhttps://gyrometric.systems/\n(Truetide owns 21.43% of the company)\n- Book value \u00a327,323\nTechnology\nGyrometric Systems, based in the UK, specialises in digital monitoring for rotating machinery. Their patented technology provides real-time data on shaft rotation and alignment, detecting mechanical wear where vibration-based systems are ineffective, such as in journal bearings.\nCommercial Progress\nThe company secured additional orders from a leading marine propulsion client, supporting the commercial introduction of Gyrometric's products and affirming their quality.\nGyrometric leads a UK-US research project to develop modular thin-film journal bearings and real-time condition monitoring for wind turbines, aiming to provide alternatives for offshore applications where maintenance is difficult. The project is backed by Innovate UK and NOWRDC, with partners including Leonardo Testing Systems, OREC, Tufts University, Kingsbury Inc, and a major US wind turbine manufacturer.\nGyrometric has shipped its instruments to the US, with lab trials at Kingsbury scheduled for November 2025. If trials are successful, their systems could be used in both new and refurbished turbines, offering significant commercial opportunities globally.\nListed Investments\nAt 30 September 2025, Truetide held investments in the following UK listed companies:\nAutins Group plc\nhttps://autins.com/\n(Truetide owned 29.09%) - Book value \u00a31,429,560\nDesigns and manufactures acoustic and thermal insulation solutions for automotive and other sectors. As of September 2025, unaudited five-month sales were \u00a37.7m with a net loss before tax of \u00a3258k. Operations were heavily impacted by the JLR cyber incident, though management is working to minimise exposure to order delays. At the AGM, shareholders voted to keep Non-executive Chair Adam Attwood despite Truetide's recommendation that he should resign to refresh the board.\nBuilt Cybernetics plc\nhttps://builtcybernetics.com/\n(Truetide owned 4.1%) - Book value \u00a3327,540\nProvides architectural, interior design, and smart building services for international office, residential, education, industrial, hospitality, and hybrid developments. The October 2025 update noted challenging trading for the year but reported stronger orders in September.\nImage Scan Group plc\nhttps://ish.co.uk/\n(Truetide owned 7.4%) - Book value \u00a3141,704\nSupplies real-time X-ray screening systems for security and industry. Recently launched AI threat recognition software and secured a major portable X-ray contract for military and counter-terrorism. As of August 2025, projected annual sales were below expectations, but cash reserves remained solid.\nImaging Biometrics Limited\nhttps://www.ibailtd.com/\n(Truetide owned 29.35%) - Book value \u00a3470,703\nImaging Biometrics Ltd (IBAI) is an imaging software, healthcare diagnostics and medical research company, whose subsidiaries include Imaging Biometrics, LLC (IB), Stone Checker Software Limited and Kirkstall Ltd. IB is a healthcare imaging software company that supplies medical technology solutions, regulatory consulting services and has a neuroimaging product portfolio. Stone Checker Software Limited is a supplier of technology solutions in the field of kidney stone analysis and kidney stone prevention. Imaging Biometrics' ordinary shares are listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Trevor Brown is the CEO of Imaging Biometrics.\nIn the period to 30 September 2025, IBAI announced IB's development agreements with MedImageMetric (MIM) and Vivan Therapeutics. Post period, on 14 October, IBAI announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirkstall Limited from Truetide.\nTruetide also has several portfolio investments that are smaller scale legacy investments for which we continue to seek exits where appropriate.\nPost Period\nKirkstall Limited\nhttps://kirkstall.com/\n- Book value at period end \u00a3146,421 (Nil at 31 March 2025).\nFollowing a strategic review of this business and negotiations with investee company Imaging Biometrics Limited (IBAI), it was agreed that after many years in Company's portfolio, Kirkstall's sales of QV1200 are beginning to grow and move beyond its established UK university customer base. A key target for its products is the US market and to support this, Kirkstall needs a US partner.\u00a0IBAI is a UK-based medical research company with a US subsidiary in this market, which we believe has the market knowledge and expertise to support Kirkstall's future growth.\nThe sale of Truetide's entire holding in Kirkstall Limited for \u00a3146,421 was completed and announced on 14 October 2025.\nhttps://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/TRUE/replacement-sale-of-kirkstall-and-cln/17278135\nOn 9 October 2025, the Company announced its change of name to Truetide plc, previously Braveheart Investment Group plc.\nOutlook\nThe near-term future of Truetide is closely aligned to the near-term values of our investments. Since a major proportion of shareholder funds are deployed into the listed segment of our portfolio, it should be much easier than in the past for shareholders to keep track of changes in NAV, hopefully positive, as the second half of the year unfolds.\nTrevor Brown\nChief Executive Officer\n25 October 2025\nCondensed consolidated statement of COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nfor the six months ended

The financial information in this half-yearly report, which was approved by the Board and authorised for issue on 25 October 2025 is unaudited.\nThe interim financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts for the purpose of sections 434 and 435 of the Companies Act 2006. The comparative financial information presented herein for the year ended 31 March 2025 has been extracted from the Group's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 which have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The Group's independent auditor's report on those accounts was unqualified, did not include references to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe preparation of the half-yearly report requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In preparing this half-yearly report, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as those applied by the Group in its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 and which will form the basis of the 2025 Annual Report and Accounts. The interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the financial statements for year ended 31 March 2025 which is on the assumption that the Company is a going concern.\nGoing Concern\nThe Directors have reviewed the Group's and the Company's budgets and plans, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is therefore appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\na) New and amended standards adopted by the Group\nA number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. These new/amended standards do not have a material impact on the Group, and the Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\nb) New accounting policies adopted by the Group\nThere were no new accounting policies adopted by the Group during the period, nor any amendments to existing accounting policies.\n2 (Loss)/Earnings per share\nThe basic (loss)/earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the (loss)/ profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nThe calculation of (loss)/ earnings per share is based on the following profit and number of shares in issue:\nSix months ended\nSix months ended\nYear ended\n30 Sept 2025\n30 Sept 2024\n31 Mar 2025\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nProfit/ (Loss) for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent\n129,044\n43,606\n(1,088,901)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue:\n- For basic earnings per ordinary share\n78,473,489\n63,723,489\n63,723,489\n- Potentially dilutive ordinary shares\n-\n-\n-\n- For diluted earnings per ordinary share\n78,473,489\n63,723,489\n63,723,489\nDilutive earnings per share adjusts for share options granted where the exercise price is less than the average price of the ordinary shares during the period. At the end of the current period there were no potentially dilutive ordinary shares.\n3 Investments at fair value through profit or loss\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nEquity investments in quoted companies\nEquity investments in unquoted companies\nDebt investments in unquoted companies\nEquity investments in unquoted companies\nDebt investments in unquoted companies\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAt 31 March 2024\n(audited)\n1,614,095\n-\n-\n39,246\n-\n1,653,341\nAdditions at cost\n327,206\n-\n-\n22,500\n-\n349,706\nDisposals\n(84,000)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(84,000)\nAmount owed to creditors\n-\n-\n-\n(11)\n-\n(11)\nChange in Fair Value\n464,992\n-\n-\n(34,417)\n-\n430,575\nAt 30 September 2024\n(unaudited)\n2,322,293\n-\n-\n27,318\n-\n2,349,611\nAdditions at cost\n863,774\n-\n-\n-\n-\n863,774\nDisposals\n(103,079)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(103,079)\nAmount owed to creditors\n-\n-\n-\n2\n-\n2\nChange in Fair Value\n(839,303)\n-\n-\n47\n-\n(839,256)\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAt 31 March 2025\n(audited)\n2,243,685\n-\n-\n27,367\n-\n2,271,052\nAdditions at cost\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDisposals\n(163,254)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(163,254)\nAmount owed to creditors\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nChange in Fair Value\n289,121\n-\n-\n146,387\n-\n435,508\nAt 30 September 2025\n(unaudited)\n2,369,552\n-\n-\n173,754\n-\n2,543,306\nThe Group classifies its investments using a fair value hierarchy. Classification within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant investment as follows:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1 - valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets;\n\u00b7\nLevel 2 - valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1; and\n\u00b7\nLevel 3 - valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n\u00b7\nThe fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices in an active market at the reporting date. All unquoted investments have been classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, their respective valuations having been calculated using a number of valuation techniques and assumptions, notwithstanding that the basis of the valuation methodology used most commonly by the Group is 'price of most recent investment'. When using the DCF valuation method, reasonably possible alternative assumptions could have a material effect on the fair valuation of investments. The impact on the fair value of investments if the discount rate and provision shift by 1% is \u00a325,429 (2024: \u00a323,496).\n4 Share capital\n30 Sept 2025\n30 Sept 2024\n31 Mar 2025\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\nAuthorised\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n108,473,489 ordinary shares of 2 pence each\n(30 September 2024: 83,723,489,\n31 March 2025: 83,723,489)\n2,169,469\n1,674,470\n1,674,470\nAllotted, called up and fully paid\n78,473,489 ordinary shares of 2 pence each\n(30 September 2024: 63,723,489,\n31 March 2025: 63,723,489)\n1,569,469\n1,274,469\n1,274,469\nThe Company has one class of ordinary shares.

The CLN has a principal value of\u00a0\u00a3170,000,\u00a0\u00a3146,421.41\u00a0of which will be subscribed for by Truetide in settlement of the Consideration and\u00a0\u00a323,578.59\u00a0will be subscribed for in cash.\n6 Availability of Interim Results\nShareholder communications\nA copy of this report is available on request from the Company's registered office: 1 George Square, Glasgow, G2 1AL.
