UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN]\n14 January 2026\nTruetide plc\n(\"\nTruetide\n\" the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nInvestment update - Paraytec\nTruetide (AIM: TRUE) announces an update on one of its investee companies, Paraytec Limited (\"\nParaytec\n\"). Truetide has a 100% interest in Paraytec.\nParaytec has initiated a focused development program to establish a high-throughput, real-time fluorescent assay for alpha-synuclein fibril formation using the CX300 detection system.\nAlpha-synuclein aggregation is widely regarded as the central pathological process in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Despite intensive industry efforts, no disease-modifying therapy has yet reached the market, in part due to the absence of robust, rapid and cost-effective screening tools capable of identifying molecules that prevent or reverse pathological aggregation.\nThe planned work comprises:\n\u00b7\nproduction and purification of recombinant wild-type and selected pathogenic mutant alpha-synuclein proteins;\n\u00b7\noptimisation of site-specific fluorescent labelling compatible with real-time measurement on the CX300 instrument;\n\u00b7\nfull validation of the assay across multiple alpha-synuclein variants; and\n\u00b7\npreparation of a technical methods paper and presentation at leading international synucleinopathy conferences in 2026, supported by collaboration with Professor Oliver Bandmann (Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SiTRAN)).\nIn the event of a successful completion, Paraytec expects to possess a proprietary, accurate, rapid and low-cost assay that is currently unavailable from any commercial source in a format optimised for the CX300 platform. The directors of Paraytec believe that this assay has the potential to become a preferred screening tool for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies active in the synucleinopathy field.\nThe combination of high sensitivity, real-time kinetics, and low sample consumption positions the CX300 system to capture meaningful market share in what is a multi-billion-dollar drug discovery segment. Initial commercialisation routes under active consideration include reagent kit sales, fee-for-service screening and strategic partnerships with instrument vendors and therapeutic developers.\nThe Board of Truetide views this investment by Paraytec as a high-return opportunity to establish clear technical differentiation for the CX300 platform in one of the most commercially attractive areas of neurodegenerative disease research.\nA further announcement will be made upon completion of the program and publication of the validation data.\nTrevor Brown, CEO of Truetide, commented:\n\"Paraytec remains close to making the scientific and commercial breakthrough via its CX300 technology, that the directors of Truetide hope for. Although somewhat protracted, the development work for a rapid Gram test continues, this new program to establish a high-throughput, real-time fluorescent assay for alpha-synuclein fibril formation significantly increases Paraytec's exposure to the possibility of eventual commercialisation of the CX300.\"\nTruetide plc\nTel: 01738 587555\nTrevor Brown, Chief Executive Officer\nViv Hallam, Executive Director\nAllenby Capital Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nJames Reeve / Ashur Joseph\nAlbR Capital Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7469 0936\nDuncan Vasey\u00a0/\u00a0Lucy Williams\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Progress has continued in activities of the Group's portfolio companies and summaries of their operations follow later in this report.\nFinancial Review\nThe Directors have undertaken an unaudited interim review of the valuations of the Group's investments and have concluded that, as at 30 September 2025, the fair value of the Group's investments were as follows:\n\u00b7\nValuation of Portfolio Investments: \u00a30 (31 March 2024: \u00a339,000)*\n\u00b7\nValuation of unconsolidated Strategic Investments: \u00a32,543,000 (31 March 2025: \u00a32,271,000)**\n* these are the historic investments made by Truetide plc up to 2015\n** these are the new investments made by Truetide plc since 2015\nTherefore, the total unaudited value of our unconsolidated investment portfolio as at 30 September 2025 is \u00a32,543,000 (31 March 2025: \u00a32,271,000).

IBAI is a Jersey-registered company in which Truetide currently holds a 29.35% interest.\nOn 15 October 2025, the Company entered into a variation to the sales and purchase agreement with IBAI in relation to the sale of the shares in Kirkstall, pursuant to which Truetide has agreed to write off all loan balances previously owed by Kirkstall to Truetide, totalling \u00a3220,853.67, of which \u00a328,500 was owed to The Ridings Early Growth Investment Company Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.\nThe loans had been written down to zero by Truetide in its most recent accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 as a prudent assessment of their current value, since the business was loss making and unlikely to make any repayments in the reasonably foreseeable future. As these loans had already been written down to zero in the Company's accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025, this variation has no additional financial impact on Truetide.\nFor further information:\nTruetide plc\nTel: 01738 587555\nTrevor Brown, Chief Executive Officer\nViv Hallam, Executive Director\nAllenby Capital Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nJames Reeve / Ashur Joseph\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7469 0936\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The transaction also includes the issuance of a convertible loan note (\"\nCLN\n\") by IBAI to Truetide.\nUnder the terms of a share purchase agreement dated 10 October 2025 (the \"\nSPA\n\"), Truetide has disposed of its holding of 1,759,706 Ordinary shares of \u00a30.10, 3,821 A Ordinary shares of \u00a30.10 and 7,550,299 Ordinary B shares of \u00a30.001 in Kirkstall, representing 86.11% of Kirkstall's issued share capital.\nThe total consideration for the sale is \u00a3146,421.41 (the \"\nConsideration\n\"), equivalent to \u00a30.015717 per Kirkstall share, and will be satisfied by the issuance of an unsecured Convertible Loan Note (the \"\nCLN\n\") by IBAI to Truetide. The CLN has a principal value of \u00a3170,000, \u00a3146,421.41 of which will be subscribed for by Truetide in settlement of the Consideration and \u00a323,578.59 will be subscribed for in cash.\nThe CLN bears interest at 6% per annum, which will accrue and be added to the loan balance. It is unsecured and subordinated, and may be converted into Ordinary Shares of IBAI at the discretion of Truetide, in whole or in part, at the lower of\n\u00a30.0075\nor the subscription price of any fundraising completed by IBAI prior to conversion. The final redemption date is 31 December 2027.\nUnder the terms of the CLN, Truetide may not issue a conversion notice if doing so would result in Truetide, together with any persons deemed to be acting in concert with it (as defined in the UK Takeover Code), holding 30% or more of IBAI's issued share capital (as enlarged by such conversion).\nFollowing completion of the sale, Kirkstall's shareholder agreement includes drag-along provisions that would enable IBAI to acquire the remaining shares in Kirkstall not covered by the SPA. It is anticipated that IBAI will exercise these provisions to acquire 100% ownership of Kirkstall.\nTruetide will hold the CLN as an investment.\nAfter many years in Company's portfolio, Kirkstall's sales of QV1200 are beginning to grow and move beyond its established UK university customer base. A key target for its products is the US market and to support this, Kirkstall really needs a US partner.\nIBAI is a UK based medical research company with a US subsidiary in this market, which we believe has the market knowledge and expertise support Kirkstall's future growth.\nThe book value of Truetide's investment in Kirkstall as at 31 March 2025 was zero.

In the year ended 31 March 2025, Kirkstall made a loss of \u00a34,091 and had net assets of -\u00a3116,185.\nFor further information:\nTruetide plc\nTel: 01738 587555\nTrevor Brown, Chief Executive Officer\nViv Hallam, Executive Director\nAllenby Capital Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3328 5656\nJames Reeve / Ashur Joseph\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 7469 0936\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Key Insights IBAI Progress: Truetide's stake in IBAI saw a sharp jump following progress in its AI neuroimaging tools and U.S. market expansion efforts, boosting speculative interest. IGE Contract: Gains in IGE stemmed from the confirmed delivery of a \u00a33 million defense contract, signaling future revenue growth for Truetide after previous delays. Portfolio Boost: Combined, these positive developments represent a significant boost to Truetide's per-share net asset value (NAV), which analysts estimate could increase to around 4.65p.",

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

Then you have IGE, already on the rise, and BUC  which seems to have taken steps to turn it around. I can see why some would be buying at this discount to asset value.

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

Then you have IGE, already on the rise, and BUC  which seems to have taken steps to turn it around. I can see why some would be buying at this discount to asset value.

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

Key Insights IBAI Progress: Truetide's stake in IBAI saw a sharp jump following progress in its AI neuroimaging tools and U.S. market expansion efforts, boosting speculative interest. IGE Contract: Gains in IGE stemmed from the confirmed delivery of a \u00a33 million defense contract, signaling future revenue growth for Truetide after previous delays. Portfolio Boost: Combined, these positive developments represent a significant boost to Truetide's per-share net asset value (NAV), which analysts estimate could increase to around 4.65p.",

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

Then you have IGE, already on the rise, and BUC  which seems to have taken steps to turn it around. I can see why some would be buying at this discount to asset value.

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

IGE Contract: Gains in IGE stemmed from the confirmed delivery of a \u00a33 million defense contract, signaling future revenue growth for Truetide after previous delays.

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

Then you have IGE, already on the rise, and BUC  which seems to have taken steps to turn it around. I can see why some would be buying at this discount to asset value. That 1 million looks like a gift already. I noticed the offer ticked up before those two bigger trades  of 500k eack showed up.",

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",

IGE Contract: Gains in IGE stemmed from the confirmed delivery of a \u00a33 million defense contract, signaling future revenue growth for Truetide after previous delays. Portfolio Boost: Combined, these positive developments represent a significant boost to Truetide's per-share net asset value (NAV), which analysts estimate could increase to around 4.65p.",

However, analysts estimate the current market-based NAV is much higher, at approximately 4.81p to 5.1p per share, due to gains in its portfolio holdings. Portfolio Wins: Recent positive momentum is driven by its subsidiary Paraytec, which launched a development program for a Parkinson's disease assay, and its stake in Imaging Biometrics (IBAI), which has seen progress in AI neuroimaging. Strong Buy Technicals: Some technical analysts currently issue a \"Strong Buy\" signal based on moving averages and short-term trends. The \"Risk\" Case: Volatility and Liquidity Low Liquidity: As a small company with just 78 million shares in issue, it can be difficult to buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Negative Earnings: Truetide currently has a negative price-to-earnings (PE) ratio and negative earnings per share (EPS), typical of venture capital firms waiting for a \"liquidity event\" (selling a company) to realize profits. Portfolio Concentration: The stock's value is heavily tied to the success of a few clinical or technical milestones in its subsidiary companies, which carry high failure risks.",
