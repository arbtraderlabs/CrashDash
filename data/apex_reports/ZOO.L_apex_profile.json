Revenue stabilisation on H2 FY25 as the industry begins to recover and H1 FY25 benefited from the backlog of work from the FY24 Hollywood strikes.\n\u00b7\nGross profit was unchanged at $10.1 million (H1 FY25: $10.1 million), on lower revenues, benefiting from the cost rationalisation programme implemented and the growth in Media Services.\n\u00b7\nGross profit margin increased to 45% (H1 FY25: 37%).\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA1 increased by 18% to $2.0 million (H1 FY25: $1.7 million).\n\u00b7\nCash EBITDA\n2\n$0.6 million (H1 FY25: loss of $0.1 million) shows underlying operations now generating cash.\n\u00b7\nOperating loss of $1.2 million (H1 FY25: loss of $2.5 million).\n\u00b7\nGross cash balance of $3.3 million at period end (H1 FY25: $4.3 million / H2 FY25: $2.7 million)\nwith strong focus on cash management.\n\u00b7\n$1.7 million drawn on the invoice financing facilities (H1 FY25: $0.5 million / H2 FY25: $0.0 million); as a result of the proactive decision to reduce aged creditors in the period.\n\u00b7\nCurrent liabilities reduced to $14.4 million (H1 FY25: $18.7 million).\n1\nEBITDA with the impact of share-based payments removed\n2\nAdjusted EBITDA less spend on capitalised development and property costs.

While the transactional nature of our business offers limited visibility of revenues for the duration of H2, we are trading in line with our expectations and are confident that we remain on track to deliver full year results in line with market expectations.3\nThrough the remainder of FY26 we expect to make further progress in developing existing customer relationships by deploying ZOO's tech-enabled proposition to enhance their end-to-end localisation and digital media strategies, and we are targeting to increase our market share and a return to revenue growth in FY27.\nStuart Green, CEO of ZOO Digital, commented:\n\"These results demonstrate that ZOO has started to turn the corner following industry disruption. We are now on a more solid footing with a rightsized cost base, stable revenues, improved profitability, and generating cash. We are focused on improving our working capital position, investing in our technology, and further expanding our existing international operations. To have achieved this whilst integrating AI into our workflows - contributing to the launch of our market-leading Fast Track service - and completing an international reorganisation of our business, is a credit to the hard work of the team here at ZOO.\n\"Throughout this we have maintained the high levels of quality demanded by our customers and have created a foundation on which we believe we can capitalise on the opportunities we now see in front of us. With certain of our customers becoming more open to adopting technology to reach global audiences faster, I believe ZOO is positioned to benefit as the only truly tech-first end-to-end vendor in our market.

Its full-service proposition delivers the end-to-end services required to prepare both original and catalogue content for digital distribution; these services include dubbing, subtitling & captioning, metadata creation & localisation, mastering, artwork localisation, and media processing. Alongside this offering, ZOO also provides its customers with management platforms and strategic solutions to support their own internal globalisation operations.\nZOO is a go-to service partner for media businesses looking to globalise their content across different territories, languages, and distribution platforms. Using its innovative technology-enabled approach, ZOO helps its customers to reduce time to market, lower costs and deliver high quality products to their global audiences. The business has frameworks in place with all major Hollywood studios and streaming services. Its customers include Disney, NBCUniversal, HBO and Paramount Global.\nZOO's competitive advantage arises from three interlinking factors - the leading role it has played in the digital transformation of its sector; the world class proprietary platforms that it develops to enable this transformation; and the global supply chain of thousands of freelancers, working collaboratively in ZOO's platforms, which delivers services that scale easily to meet demand. These factors combine to make ZOO uniquely placed to capitalise on new market opportunities in a fast-paced and constantly evolving industry.\nwww.zoodigital.com\nCHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S STATEMENT\nOverview\nTrading in H1 FY26 marked a period of revenue stabilisation as the industry began to recover from the disruptions of recent years. The entertainment localisation and media services sector has experienced significant volatility - first benefiting from increased content consumption during the Covid pandemic and the rapid expansion of streaming platforms in FY22 and FY23, then facing headwinds from customer reorganisations and the writers' and actors' strikes in FY24. While H1 FY25 saw a temporary uplift due to the backlog of delayed work, revenues in H2 FY25 and H1\u00a0FY26 have held steady at approximately $22 million in each period.\nDuring this phase of consolidation, ZOO has taken proactive steps to strengthen its business. We have completed a strategic restructuring to right size the cost base to support the current revenue levels, fully integrated our international operations, launched a premium \"Fast Track\" localisation service, and embedded AI across our workflows. These initiatives have created a leaner, more agile operating model, tailored to our clients' evolving needs, and have positioned ZOO to capture a greater share of a growing market.\n\u200b\nMarket\nGlobal content spending reached $210 billion in 2024, growing at a compound annual rate of 10% (KPMG -\nThe Future of Content Spend and Business Models in Media\n). Within this, the localisation services market is estimated at $3\u00a0billion (\nSlator Language Industry Market Report\n), with approximately half of that spend attributed to major US studios and streaming platforms - giving ZOO an addressable market of at least $1.5 billion.\nStreaming platforms have moved beyond their hypergrowth phase and are now focused on profitability and subscriber retention. Localisation plays a central role in this strategy, enabling content to reach global audiences and maximise return on investment. For original content, localisation typically includes both dubbing and subtitling, with costs representing just 1-3% of the overall content budget but delivering significant uplift in viewership and engaging subscribers in international growth markets.\nWe are also seeing incremental demand for live and near-live content, particularly in sports and time-sensitive episodic programming, as streamers expand into traditional broadcast territory. Meanwhile, traditional studios are adapting to the increasing role of streaming providers, which now accounts for a greater share of TV consumption than broadcast and cable combined (Nielsen 2025). This shift has prompted more data-driven content strategies and widespread industry reorganisation, including the acquisition of Paramount Global by Skydance Media and the potential sale of Warner Bros. Discovery.\nWith the focus on profitability and changing business models we have seen an increase in the proportion of content being licensed compared with new original titles. This can be a more cost-effective and quicker way of generating new programming on a streaming platform but often requires the content to be reformatted, which is work ZOO is able to perform through its Media Services offering. Licensed content can also require localisation services, but this tends to be exclusively through subtitling due to the higher cost of dubbing.\nWith a desire for simplified vendor engagement and a focus on premium quality we are also seeing a shift in procurement behaviour.\nCustomers are moving away from fragmented regional partnerships toward working with fewer, full-service, global \"end-to-end\" providers. ZOO is one of the few companies capable of fulfilling this requirement. In a sign of an industry returning to business-as-usual following prolonged disruption, we have recently seen a significant increase in Request for Proposal (RFP) activity, which we believe reflects both our market positioning and growing customer confidence in their content strategies.\nHistorically, some clients required dubbing partners to use local studios with on-site voice artists, engineers, and directors. ZOO's decentralised model, powered by proprietary workflow technology, eliminates the need for dedicated physical studios, enabling remote collaboration and faster delivery. As deadlines shorten and budgets tighten, we believe our flexible and efficient approach is increasingly valued,\nleading to opportunities to work within new channels giving greater access to the localisation spend within our customer base.\nAdoption of Technology\nTechnology continues to play an increasingly central role in the localisation industry, with artificial intelligence (AI) now at the forefront of innovation. ZOO has long championed a tech-first approach to the complex challenge of delivering high-quality, localised media content at speed and scale across global streaming platforms.\nThe first wave of AI investment across the industry has largely focused on development. The next phase, application, is where we believe real transformation will occur. ZOO is already actively involved in this shift, integrating AI into its workflows for certain clients to enhance service delivery while maintaining the high standards and security expected by our clients.\nSince 2001, ZOO has pioneered the use of technology in localisation, disrupting traditional practices through cloud-based workflows and decentralised localisation and media services. This approach enables us to deliver fast, secure, end-to-end services at the highest standards of quality. As the industry evolves, these capabilities are becoming increasingly essential, and we believe the market is moving further in ZOO's direction.\nZOO's AI-enhanced workflows are overseen by skilled linguists and editors, enabling faster turnaround times without compromising quality. This dramatically reduces time-to-market, unlocks new possibilities for clients to localise emerging content types with a premium service offering, and future proofs ZOO's position in the market.\nAs with most technical innovations there are always concerns, and this is certainly true in our industry with AI. Several of our customers explicitly require that AI is not used due to their concerns about quality, security and copyright. We will always ensure our processes meet the highest standards and prioritise security and copyright protection above all. We have implemented a flexible, hybrid framework enabling us to match our services with the specific requirements of each customer. This is typical of how we partner with customers to build tailored solutions for their needs, leading to trusted, longstanding industry relationships.\nOperations\nWhilst the comparator period included a backlog of work following the hiatus caused by the Hollywood writers and actors strikes, we believe the period under review represents a \"normalisation\" of business as the industry has stabilised.\n\u00b7\nRevenue of $22.4 million (H1 FY25: $27.6 million)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA1 margin 9% (H1 FY25: 6%)\n\u00b7\nCash EBITDA2 $0.6 million (H1 FY25: loss of $0.1 million).\n\u00b7\nOPEX as a % of revenue 50% (H1 FY25: 46%)\n\u00b7\nOperating loss margin 5% (H1 FY25: loss of 9%)\n\u00b7\nFreelancer network grew to 12,335 (H1 FY25: 12,112)\n\u00b7\nExternal quality score3 of 99.9% (H1 FY25: 98.8%)\n1\nAdjusted for share-based payments.\n2\nCalculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capitalised development costs and less property costs included in depreciation and finance costs (as per IFRS16).\n3\nWeighted average of quality scores given by customers on our work delivered in the period. In H1 FY26 we received quality scores on work that accounted for 58% of revenue (H1 FY25: 61%).\nFurther information on Alternative Performance Measures is provided in the notes to the interim financial statements.\nThe $10.9 million cost saving initiatives previously announced have now been completed, supporting a return to cash generation, whilst ensuring we protected the capability and infrastructure of the business to deliver high quality end-to-end services. International operations from previous acquisitions and investments have now been fully integrated into our core business allowing us to operate on a truly global level and leverage our \"follow the sun\" strategy to reduce delivery times and give greater flexibility to our customers. During this period, we have maintained the high quality of work performed with a quality score of 99.9% in the period (from those customers that provide quality score feedback). Based on feedback from our customers the Board believes that this score places ZOO amongst the highest performers in the industry.\nFor certain of our customers, we have now integrated AI into several of our workflows, improving productivity and scalability by supporting skilled human experts to achieve high levels of accuracy and authenticity as well as shortening the time-to-market of entertainment products. Whilst there is still caution in the industry regarding the use of AI, this gives customers the option to utilise the benefits AI can bring on their own terms. We believe that ZOO's proprietary tech-enabled proposition, and long history of working with the major US studios, gives us the credibility to help our customers to embrace the opportunities of AI whilst preserving the \"human in the loop\" to assure quality. The Company recently published a new edition of its white paper titled \"\nThe Future of Media Localisation\n\" providing further analysis of how we believe AI can be utilised in localisation services and establishing ZOO as a thought leader in the industry.\nFast Track\nAs streamers increasingly commission live and near-live content on their platforms, they face the challenge of distributing this content to global audiences without losing its time-sensitive appeal. ZOO has created a tailored solution with its premium \"Fast Track\" offering which we believe to be unique in the industry. Fast Track is made possible by ZOO's model, bringing together our extensive freelancer network, workflow technology, \"follow the sun\" 24 hours a day capability and AI integrations. As a result, we have been able to prepare subtitles within just 3 hours and delivered dubbing within 24 hours. This has been confirmed by our customers to achieve the same quality standard as other providers that take 1 to 2 weeks for subtitling and 2 to 3 weeks for dubbing. We have already completed several Fast Track projects, including premium content, that has since been viewed tens of millions of times around the world.\nIn an industry where delivery timelines are more generally being compressed, Fast Track has shown our customers the real value in the quality that ZOO's proposition can deliver without the need for reliance on dedicated physical studios. This has created several additional opportunities for ZOO, including extending its application across all end-to-end services. Whilst this service has generated limited revenues to date, given our customers' imperative to accelerate time to market, we expect it in time to be an important driver for future growth.\nEnd-to-End Strategy\nZOO's strategy is to provide \"end-to-end\" services to our customers, fulfilling all their requirements to prepare content for distribution - whether that is localisation services, media services, or a combination of both.\nLocalisation services include dubbing, subtitling, captioning, Audio Description, metadata localisation, and artwork localisation. These services are language-based and creative by nature, for which ZOO uses a combination of in-house resources and its extensive network of freelancers.\nMedia services include mastering, audio mixing, transcoding, packaging, metadata creation, QC and authoring. These tend to be more technical in nature and mainly utilise in-house resources.\nAll these services are managed on ZOO's proprietary cloud-based workflow technology. This allows both technical and creative teams around the world to work consistently and simultaneously on projects, managed by a distributed team of project managers and directors, whist adhering to the high levels of security demanded by our customers. The combination of our in-house resources, freelance network and technology allow us to respond rapidly to the changing requirements of our customers.\nIn H1 FY26 there has been a change in the mix of these services required with an increase in the proportion of media services. A key driver behind this has been an increase in the volume of licensed content being acquired by our customers compared to the level of new original content being produced. Licensed content is less likely to require localisation, especially dubbing, but will usually require multiple media services to ensure it meets the quality requirements and format for distribution. By being one of the few end-to-end global providers in the industry, ZOO has been able to adapt quickly to these changes, benefitting from its diversified operations to maintain revenues and improve margins.\nCost Rationalisation\nIn H1 FY26 we completed the reorganisation of the business that began in FY24. This included reducing staff numbers, migration of certain functions to our new facility in Chennai, India, and multiple initiatives to reduce overheads especially in the areas of office and IT costs. The results of these changes have reduced fixed costs, (excluding costs of freelancers and depreciation/amortisation) from $23.2\u00a0million in H1 FY24 to $15.5\u00a0million in H1 FY26. This has been implemented carefully over time to deliver a suitable cost base to seek to position the business to be cash-generative from a lower revenue base, whilst ensuring the quality and speed of services we deliver to our customers has been unaffected. This is evidenced by the resilience of revenue over the last 12 months alongside the launch of our market leading solution Fast Track and exceptional external quality scores.\nOutlook\nThe H1 FY26 trading performance was in line with management expectations, and the Board expects this to continue through to the end of the financial year. Trading since 30 September 2025 is in line with management expectations and we remain on track to deliver full year results in line with market expectations.\nThe emerging requirement amongst streamers for fast turn-around media localisation services to support accelerated time to market and the global distribution of live and near-live programming creates new opportunities which ZOO, using its now proven premium Fast Track service, is well placed to fulfil.\nThe Board also believes that more large media companies will transition to the End-to-End vendor model, partly due to their restructured operations and the desire to improve efficiency and safeguard quality. As an accomplished and proven supplier and an innovator in the industry, ZOO can address these requirements and is currently in discussions regarding several opportunities and has\nseen a significant increase in Request for Proposal (RFP) activity\n.\n\u200b\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nRevenues of $22.4 million were in line with management expectations. This was 19% below the same period last year (H1 FY25: $27.6 million) due primarily to the increased level of work processed in H1 FY25 following the backlog of work from the FY24 actors' and writers' strikes. Revenues have been stable for the last 4 quarters with $22.0\u00a0million of revenue delivered in H2 FY25.\nGross profit of $10.1 million was in line with the prior period (H1 FY25: $10.1\u00a0million), despite lower revenues, reflecting the improved efficiency and revenue mix within the business as gross margin increased to 45% (H1\u00a0FY25: 37%).\nThe Company reports segment contribution by service line, with the service lines being: 1) Localisation; 2) Media Services; and, for consistency, 3) Legacy Software Services. The contribution is calculated as revenue less the attributable direct costs. Unallocated direct costs are reported within gross margin but not included in the segmental reporting.\nLocalisation revenues of $11.4 million (H1 FY25: $17.1 million) reduced from the comparator period due to the backlog of work received in H1 FY25 following the actors' and writers' strikes, as well as the slowdown in the production of original content which led to lower demand for dubbing. Localisation gross profit contribution was $3.1 million (H1 FY25: $5.3\u00a0million) with the gross profit margin reducing to 27% from 31% in H1 FY25. Cost base reductions to offset the lower revenue were limited to ensure localisation service capabilities were protected, given ongoing discussions regarding several significant localisation opportunities.\nMedia Services revenues of $10.5 million (H1 FY25: $9.9m million) increased on H1 FY25 due to the greater volume of work relating to customers licensing third party content. Media Services contribution was $8.0\u00a0million (H1 FY25: $6.8 million) with the gross profit margin increasing to 76% from 68% in H1 FY25 due to increased efficiencies with the expansion and integration of the Indian operations.\nOperating expenses decreased 11% to $11.2 million (H1 FY25: $12.7 million) as indirect staff were reduced in both the US and the UK. Investment in India, Germany and Italy continued as the business pivoted to lower-cost production locations. Additional initiatives to reduce IT, cloud services and property costs were also completed in the period.\nExcluding variable spend on freelancers and third-party studios the cost rationalisation program has removed $7.7 million (33%) of the fixed cost base of the business, reducing the total fixed cost base from $23.2\u00a0million in H1 FY24 (the first half period prior to the commencement of the cost rationalisation program) to $15.5\u00a0million in H1 FY26.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.9 million (H1 FY25: $1.7 million), an 18% increase on H1 FY25, despite lower revenues, with the Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue increasing to 9% from 6% in H1\u00a0FY25. This improvement in EBITDA resulted in a reduced operating loss of $1.2 million (H1 FY24: $2.5 million).\nThe loss before tax for the period was $1.3 million, which compares to a loss of $2.6 million last year. This reduced loss was due to the cost rationalisation program improving EBITDA, and a reduction in the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged, reflecting the utilisation of high levels of investment in FY23 and FY24 and the reduction in the size of the workforce.\nThe cash balance as of 30 September 2025 was $3.3 million (H1 FY25: $4.3 million, H2 FY25: $2.7\u00a0million) representing an increase of $0.6\u00a0million from the FY25 year-end position. This included a reduction in trade and other payables of $5.5\u00a0million in H1 FY26 decreasing the level of aged creditors, and an accelerated conversion of work in progress to debtors.\nThe Group's cash position of $3.3 million at 30 September 2025 is further enhanced by $6 million of debt facilities with HSBC ($3.0\u00a0million US invoice financing facility, \u00a32.0\u00a0million UK invoice financing facility, \u00a30.25\u00a0million UK overdraft) of which $1.7 million was utilised at the period end (H1 FY25: $0.5 million).\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE

The Group has operations in the UK, the US, India, Europe, and South Korea.\nThe Company is a public limited company which is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered office is Castle House, Angel Street, Sheffield. The registered number of the Company is 3858881.\nThis condensed consolidated financial information is presented in US dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.\nThe interim results were approved by the board of directors on\n19 November\n2025\n.\nThis consolidated interim financial information has not been audited.\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements of ZOO Digital Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the period ending 31 March 2026 will be prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nThis Interim Report has been prepared in accordance with UK AIM listing rules which require it to be presented and prepared in a form consistent with that which will be adopted in the annual accounts having regard to the accounting standards applicable to such accounts. It has not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\".\nThe policies applied are consistent with those set out in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2025, and have been consistently applied, unless stated otherwise.\nThis condensed consolidated financial information is for the six months ended 30 September 2025. It has been prepared with regard to the requirements of IFRS. It does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in S343 of the Companies Act 2006. It does not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2025 which contained an unqualified audit report and have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. They did not contain statements under s498 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe Group has applied the same accounting policies and methods of computation in its interim consolidated financial statements as in its 2025 annual financial statements, except for those that relate to new standards and interpretations effective for the first time for periods beginning on (or after) 1 April 2025 and will be adopted in the 2026 financial statements.\nThere are no standards materially impacting the Group that will be required to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2026.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of ZOO Digital Group plc include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiary accounting policies are amended where necessary to ensure consistency within the Group and intra group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\nGoing concern\nThe Group's financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis despite the losses incurred in the period. The Group continues to have a strong order pipeline, has significant cash reserves and available financial facilities.\nSegment reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resource allocation to the segments and to assess their performance.\nLocalisation\nMedia services\nSoftware Services\nTotal\nFY26 H1\nFY25 H1\nFY26 H1\nFY25 H1\nFY26 H1\nFY25 H1\nFY26 H1\nFY25 H1\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\n$000\nRevenue\n11,434\n17,133\n10,548\n9,948\n403\n480\n22,385\n27,561\nSegment contribution\n3,063\n5,318\n8,044\n6,791\n294\n339\n11,401\n12,448\nUnallocated cost of sales\n(1,325)\n(2,338)\nGross profit\n10,076\n10,110\nGross profit %\n27%\n31%\n76%\n68%\n73%\n71%\n45%\n37%\nAlternative performance measures (APM)\nThe Group uses certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to enable the users of the Group's financial statements to understand and evaluate the performance of the Group consistently over different reporting periods. APMs are non-GAAP company specific measures. As these are non-GAAP measures, they should not be considered as replacements for IFRS measures. The Group's definition of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A description of the measures set out above is included below\u00a0with a reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure.\nAPM\nDescription\nUse\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a calculated as operating profit/(loss) before depreciation (including right of use asset depreciation), amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, share-based payment charge.\nAdjusted EBITDA gives a clearer picture of the core profitability of the group before the impact of financing and accounting entries and decisions.\nCash EBITDA\nCash EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capitalised development costs and less property costs included in depreciation and finance costs (as per IFRS16).\nCash EBITDA gives a clearer picture of how the business is generating cash. Certain salary and property costs are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Cash EBITDA includes these costs allowing an assessment of how Adjusted EBITDA converts into cash.\nFreelancer Network\nMeasure of freelancers trained and registered on the ZOO platform.\nIndication of scale of resources available.\nExternal Quality Score\nSeveral of ZOO's customers provide internal KPI measures of the quality of our work. Measures vary between companies and are usually derived from multiple contributing factors, such as on-time delivery and first-time acceptance rates. The External Quality Score is an average score weighted on the revenue of the work being assessed.\nThis KPI has replaced the previous quality measure of \"Retained Sales\" as the Board believes it gives a clearer and independent measure of performance.

While the transactional nature of our business offers limited visibility of revenues for the duration of H2, we are trading in line with our expectations and are confident that we remain on track to deliver full year results in line with market expectations.3\nThrough the remainder of FY26 we expect to make further progress in developing existing customer relationships by deploying ZOO's tech-enabled proposition to enhance their end-to-end localisation and digital media strat",

Key findings include:\n\u00b7\nAI is best deployed as Artificial Assistance:\nAI delivers greatest value in media localisation when enhancing traditional practices rather than replacing them. New technologies are accelerating subtitling, dubbing and transcription, yet premium entertainment still depends on human creativity to ensure cultural authenticity, emotional impact and creative nuance.\n\u00b7\nIndustry use cases are expanding:\nApplications of AI for media localisation, from transcription to machine translation, are already offering significant productivity benefits and enhancing the end product. However, fully automated subtitling and dubbing are only useful for lower-value user-generated content or factual and literal content without conversational dialogue.\u00a0Other use cases such as synthetic voices and picture manipulation come with careful ethical considerations due to their use of personal data.\n\u00b7\nInnovation creates new opportunities:\nWorkflow efficiencies are rapidly accelerating turnaround times, making it possible to localise new and growing forms of content more quickly. This is aligned with the strategy of streaming companies to expand into live and near-live content where localisation was not previously feasible in the required timeframes.\n\u00b7\nEthics and regulations make responsible adoption essential:\nWith the EU AI Act1 now in force and SAG-AFTRA2 securing consent-based protections for performers, transparency, consent and governance are essential to responsible AI adoption. The legal framework now emerging favours responsible vendors with strong ethical standards and robust governance processes.\n\u00b7\nInnovation supports growing market demand:\nThe global language services industry is projected to reach $75.7 billion in 2025 (source: Nimdzi), with media localisation accounting for $5 billion (source: Slator). Studios, platforms and vendors are seeking faster, more scalable solutions that meet rising consumer demand while safeguarding creative integrity.\nStuart Green, CEO of ZOO Digital, said:\n\"Over the last year, AI in media localisation has moved beyond promise to a practical reality. This is creating opportunity for companies with the expertise to apply AI effectively to accelerate delivery without compromising on quality or security.\n\"ZOO is well placed in our market as the only end-to-end vendor that I believe combines a truly tech-first approach with the production expertise demanded by our clients. Overseen by skilled linguists, this is dramatically reducing time-to-market for content and unlocking new possibilities such as Fast Track, our premium offering for localising live and near-live content on streaming platforms.\n\"As the original pioneer in an industry becoming more dependent on technology, the market is moving in ZOO's direction. Our technology background makes us the natural partner for the media industry's future as we expand our share of a structural growth market.\"\nThe full white paper is available for download at:\nhttps://www.zoodigital.com/ai-white-paper\nInvestor and sell-side analyst webinar\nThe Company will host a webinar for investors and sell-side analysts at 3.00pm GMT on Thursday, 6 November 2025. The event will discuss the findings of the white paper and provide an update on ZOO's AI strategy, as follows:\n\u00b7\nOverview of white paper and ZOO's AI strategy - Stuart Green, CEO\n\u00b7\nThe commercial perspective - Gordon Doran, President\n\u00b7\nZOO's AI development - Chris Oakley, CTO\n\u00b7\nAI in action - Raul Aldana, VP Dubbing\n\u00b7\nQ&A\nNo price-sensitive information will be disclosed at the event.

The Act entered into force on August 1, 2024, with most provisions becoming applicable by August 2, 2026.\n2\nSAG-AFTRA is an American labour union that represents a wide range of media professionals, including actors and singers, formed in 2012 by the merger of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA).\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nZOO ",

At the meeting,\u00a0Gillian Wilmot, Chairman, will make the following statement:\n\"The evolution of our operating environment continues, with streaming platforms now taking the majority of TV viewing time and content strategies evolving at pace to bring in new customers and engage existing viewers.\n\"As a result, we are currently seeing increased levels of licensing of existing content rather than new original content, a growing interest from streamers for live and near live content, and customers looking for localisation partners to utilise AI to increase speed and lower costs.\n\"Whilst it is early days, as a technology-first business, ZOO is well placed to capitalise on these shifts. Growing demand for localisation services within reduced timeframes, and the increased use of AI, allows us to leverage our proven technology platform to meet customer needs. We recently successfully completed a dubbing project in 24 hours, compared with 2-3 weeks which is more typical in the industry, and integrated AI for a key customer. Further consolidation in the industry means customers are working with a smaller number of genuine end to end providers, such as ZOO.\n\"We are seeing the benefits of the proactive changes we made during FY25, and are continuing to implement our cost saving plans during FY26. These have allowed us to create a sustainable platform for the future while retaining the flexibility to scale as we deliver increased order volumes.\n\"Revenues for H1 FY26 are expected to be approximately $22 million, in line with H2 FY 25, with the revenue from higher margin media services and subtitling expected to grow by 20% offsetting the reduction in dubbing revenues.\u00a0With the cost savings implemented being realised, and the favourable revenue mix, H1 EBITDA is in line with management expectations. With the improved profitability, the Group is continuing to normalise its working capital position after active management of creditors in FY25.\"\nPresentation slides that will accompany an investor update following the AGM will be available on the Company's website later today. Shareholders may register to join a live stream of the AGM, investor briefing and Q&A here:\nhttps://www.zoodigital.com/agm-2025\nThe Company intends to announce its unaudited interim financial results for the six months to\u00a030\u00a0September 2025\u00a0in\u00a0November 2025.\nThis announcement contains inside information as defined in Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation No. 596/2014 (\"MAR\").

I believe we have struck a balance between creating a sustainable platform for the future while retaining the flexibility to scale as we deliver increased order volumes.\n\"As a trusted partner, with a technology-enabled, end-to-end model, we can build solutions for customers' specific needs. Our new Fast Track service, tailored for localising live and near-live content, has been well received and although revenue is modest at this stage, the Board is encouraged by the potential growth opportunity this presents the Group as we seek to increase our share of spend by several global streamers over the longer term.\n\"Today we believe most media companies are operating profitable streaming platforms, supported by new content formats and monetisation models. We enter FY26 better positioned to navigate this environment and capture profitable revenue opportunities as the market continues to evolve.\"\nHIGHLIGHTS\nKey Financials\n\u00b7\nRevenue increased by 22% to $49.6 million (FY24: $40.6 million).\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA1 returned to a profit of $1.1\u00a0million (FY24: loss of $13.6\u00a0million).\n\u00b7\nOperating loss of $6.5 million (FY24: loss of $19.1 million).\n\u00b7\nReported loss before tax of $8.3 million (FY24: loss of $20.5 million).\n\u00b7\nGross cash at year-end of\n$2.7 million (FY24: $5.3 million) with no amount drawn on the invoice financing facilities; strong focus on cash management.\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nDuring the period, $8.4 million of annual fixed cost cash savings were delivered (including $1.6\u00a0million of capitalised R&D costs), and further actions implemented in FY26 that the Board expects will deliver at least a further $2.5\u00a0million of annual fixed cost savings, highlighting the Company's focus to be profitable and cash generative.\n\u00b7\nRetained sales\n2\nof 98.4% (FY24: 92.3%), demonstrating recovery in demand and customer satisfaction.\n\u00b7\nStrengthened relationships with non-traditional studios to support customer diversification.\n\u00b7\nZOO named a Preferred Fulfilment Vendor for Amazon Prime Video.\nCurrent Trading and Outlook\n\u00b7\nCurrent reduced demand for dubbing led to FY26Q1 revenue 18% lower than the same period in FY25.\n\u00b7\nService lines excluding dubbing have generated three consecutive quarters of revenue growth to FY26Q1.\n\u00b7\nContinuing cost reductions resulted in an EBITDA profit for FY26Q1 after restructuring costs in line with management expectations.\n\u00b7\nThe combination of the implementation of AI and other forms of automation, together with the operational efficiencies delivered in FY25 and continuing in FY26, provide a leaner operating model to enable enhanced margins as revenues recover.\n1\nAdjusted EBITDA means earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and share-based payments.\n2\nRetained sales represents the proportion of client revenues retained from one year to the next and provides a quality indication that helps to assess customer satisfaction.\nFor further enquiries please contact:\nZOO Digital Group plc\n+44 114 241 3700\nStuart Green\n-\nChief Executive Officer\nRobert Pursell - Chief Financial Officer\nC\nanaccord Genuity\n(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nSimon Bridges / Harry Gooden / Andrew Potts / George Grainger\n+44 20 7523 8000\nVigo Consulting (Financial Communications)\nTim McCall / Rozi Morris / Joe Quinlan\n+44 20 7390 0230\nZOO@vigoconsulting.com\n\u200b\nAnalyst presentation\nStuart Green, Chief Executive Officer, will host an online presentation for sell-side equity analysts, followed by Q&A, at 10:00 BST today.

Upon the publication of this Announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n8 May 2025\nZOO DIGITAL GROUP PLC\n(\"ZOO\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update\n\u00b7\nSubject to audit, FY25 revenue is expected to be up 22% to $49.4* million and adjusted EBITDA of at least $0.1 million (FY24: loss of $13.6\u00a0million)\n\u00b7\nNet cash as at 31 March 2025 of $2.6 million\n\u00b7\nBusiness is proactively restructuring its costs to focus on being profitable and cash-generative from a lower revenue base, reflecting the challenging trading conditions\n\u00b7\n$6.8 million of annualised fixed cost savings made since the start of FY25 with a further $1.7\u00a0million savings being implemented in FY26\nZOO Digital Group plc (AIM: ZOO), the localisation and digital media services partner to the global entertainment industry, provides a trading update for the financial year ended 31 March 2025 (\"FY25\").\nFurther to the announcement of 2 February 2025, the assets related to several high value projects were not delivered during FY25Q4 and are expected to be delivered during the first half of FY26. As a result, the Board expects revenue for FY25 to be $49.4\u00a0million, which is up 22% on the prior year, and for EBITDA (adjusted for share-based payments) to be at least $0.1 million\n(FY24: loss of $13.6\u00a0million)*\n.\nCash at 31\u00a0March\u00a02025 was ahead of expectations at $2.6\u00a0million* due to a strong focus on cash management and working capital, including active management of trade creditors. The Group's invoice discounting facilities of $3\u00a0million and \u00a32\u00a0million were unutilised at 31 March 2025. The Board expects to partially draw on these facilities during FY26. Cash management continues to be a key focus for the business.\nThe Board has continued its programme of cost reductions throughout 2025, having implemented $6.8\u00a0million of costs savings in FY25 attributed to people, property and legal and professional expenses. This initiative is ongoing with the Board having already identified a further $1.7 million of additional savings to be delivered in FY26, attributed primarily to people and IT expenditure. The Board is committed to continuing to improve operational efficiency in FY26 to enable the business to deliver profits and positive cash generation in the event market conditions continue to remain challenging.\nThe cost savings are a result of a continued efficiency programme, taking advantage of previous offshore investments to lower the fixed costs of fulfilling a range of services while moving some previously fixed costs to variable, as well as a detailed review of property, IT and other expenses. The Company is adopting a range of AI technologies that, taken together with the wider efficiency programme, are focussed on delivering a more flexible, lower cost operation that can scale efficiently with revenue growth as the end markets recover.\nThe media and entertainment industry continues to adapt to a changing market environment following the disruption of the past two years, including the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes. The Company expects its customers to continue to license a greater proportion of content and as a result, the Board anticipates that FY26 revenues are likely to include several larger, non-repeating projects. This leads to greater challenges in forecasting of revenues and resourcing due to the uncertainty and timing of ZOO's customers concluding arrangements with licensors and licensees.\nThe Board also notes the recent announcement from the US government relating to potential 100% tariffs on films made outside the United States. The Board is monitoring the tariff proposals and engagement with the industry and will provide a further update in due course. While the Board believes that it is too early to form a view on the impact on ZOO's operations or that of its customers, it is fully committed to adjusting the cost base as necessary to achieve its FY26 objectives of delivering profits and generating cash. As a result of the current challenging market environment the Board believes that revenues for FY26 will be below previous expectations.\nFurther to the announcement of 23 January 2025 that it is seeking a new CFO, the Board is pleased to separately announce today the appointment of a new CFO.\nStuart Green, Chief Executive Officer of ZOO Digital, said:\n\"We are fundamentally reshaping the business to right size our operations and create a sustainable platform for the future. This proactive approach positions ZOO to be profitable and cash generative in the current challenging market, and as industry dynamics change, benefitting from our competitive advantage as a technology-enabled, highly scalable business.

          "full_content": "20 Feb 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 7764X\nZoo Digital Group PLC\n20 February 2025\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014 as retained as part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 as amended. Upon the publication of this Announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n20 February 2025\nZOO DIGITAL GROUP PLC\n(\"ZOO\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update\nZOO Digital Group plc (AIM: ZOO), the localisation and digital media services partner to the global entertainment industry,\ntoday provides an update on trading and outlook for the financial year ending 31 March 2025 (\"FY25\").\nThe Board currently expects full year FY25 revenues will be at least $50.5 million, which is up 24% on the prior year. The full year revenues will result in a return to EBITDA profit of at least $1.0 million, compared to a loss of $13.6 million last year. As a result, FY25 revenues and EBITDA1 are expected to be below market expectations2.\nThe Company has implemented targeted cost saving measures, reducing its fixed costs by 20% during the year and also expects blended gross margins to improve to 36%. The ongoing restructuring of the cost base to reduce the unit cost of production provides a strong platform to return to cash breakeven. The Company has also been closely managing its cash position and it expects the balance at the end of FY25 will exceed c.$1 million, and has invoice discounting facilities of $3m and \u00a32m, which are expected to be largely unutilised.\nWhilst the Company's order book has improved in recent months through the addition of several high value projects, these are not included in the Company's current expectations for FY25. The timing of revenue recognition for these projects is uncertain as commencement for much of this work is dependent on the supply of original assets from licensors. In addition, some projects in the FY25 pipeline relate to titles that customers have either delayed or cancelled.\nThe Company has secured several new customer engagements which are expected to begin to deliver meaningful incremental revenues in FY26. This includes being named a Preferred Fulfilment Vendor (PFV) for Amazon Prime Video,\npositioning ZOO among a select group of vendors that production companies may use to digitally package and distribute content on Amazon Prime Video\n.\nThe Company is seeing a marked increase in customer discussions around new projects to a level greater than at any time over the past two years. Currently, an enlarged proportion of customer assignments relate to them both licensing in third party content and licensing out catalogues, rather than the processing of new original programming. The Board envisages that this will be an ongoing trend, with the additional volumes of original content starting to recover later in FY26.\nBased on current visibility, ZOO expects that dubbing revenues for FY26 will be lower than in FY25. However, with a lower cost base and higher margin revenue mix the overall profitability of the business is expected to improve significantly year on year.\nThe Company will provide a further update on trading in a pre-close statement in April.\nThe persons responsible for arranging for the release of this announcement on behalf of ZOO are Stuart Green, Chief Executive Officer and Phillip Blundell, Chief Financial Officer of ZOO.\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nZOO Digital Group plc\n+44\u00a0(0) 114 241 3700\nStuart Green - Chief Executive Officer\nPhillip Blundell - Chief Financial Officer\nCanaccord Genuity (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7523 8000\nSimon Bridges / Harry Gooden / Andrew Potts / George Grainger\nVigo Consulting (Financial communications)\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nTim McCall / Rozi Morris\nzoo@vigoconsulting.com\n1\nAdjusted for share-based payments.\n2\nFor the purpose of this announcement, the Group believes market consensus for FY25 to be revenue of $55m, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.75m.\nAbout ZOO Digital Group plc:\nZOO Digital partners with major Hollywood studios and streaming services to tell their stories to audiences around the world.\nThe Group's localisation and digital media services allow customers to globalise content across different territories, languages and distribution platforms, extending its reach and profitability.\nDeploying proprietary technology platforms and 12,000+ freelancers, ZOO offers end-to-end dubbing, subtitling and captioning, metadata creation and localisation, mastering, artwork creation and localisation, and media processing.\nZOO has frameworks in place with all major Hollywood studios and streaming services, helping them to capitalise on new opportunities in a fast-paced industry.

At the meeting,\u00a0Gillian Wilmot, Chairman, will make the following statement:\n\"The streaming industry continues its transition following strategic realignments and the strikes of 2023. Recent months have witnessed the early stages of recovery as major US media organisations have enacted their plans to adjust for a future in which traditional linear television plays a diminishing role. While many productions that resumed following the strikes have since been completed and distributed to global audiences, changes made in the mix of content types acquired and capital allocation policies, which are more strategic in nature, will take a longer period to yield results and restore levels of industry output to those seen in 2022, particularly in Hollywood.\n\"Against this backdrop ZOO has seen a strong recovery in its pipeline over the first half of FY25 and expects to deliver sales in the period of at least $27\u00a0million, equating to a 28% increase over the equivalent prior year period and 42% up on the previous half. As previously stated, the Board expects EBITDA profit in the first half.\n\"Market participants anticipate the industry's recovery continuing until late 2025 which is consistent with the indications ZOO has been provided by its customers.\n\"The Board continues to be confident that the changes arising from the realignment of ZOO's major customers will, in due course, be favourable for the Group. These include accelerated transition to an end-to-end approach with fewer, more capable suppliers; an increasingly diverse mix of original international content with a shift to episodic over feature titles; and greater dependence on ZOO's software platforms, all of which will be advantageous to the Group.\n\"The Company continues to manage its cash position carefully whilst protecting production capability and capacity to satisfy the demand of its customers. As a result, the unaudited cash balance as at 30\u00a0September 2024 is expected to exceed $2 million.\n\"Visibility extends only to January 2025, as is normally the case for the ZOO business, however, the Board expects further profitable progress that will put us on track to meet market guidance for the full year ending 31 March 2025.\"\nPresentation slides that will accompany an investor update following the AGM will be available on the Company's website later today. Shareholders may register to join a live stream of the AGM, investor briefing and Q&A here:\nhttps://www.zoodigital.com/agm-2024\n.\nThe Company intends to announce its unaudited interim financial results for the six months to 30\u00a0September 2024 in November 2024.\nThis announcement contains inside information as defined in Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation No. 596/2014 (\"MAR\").

ZOO was on a strong growth trajectory before the industry disruption, reaching over $90\u00a0million in sales in FY23. The significant decline in revenues and profits reported for FY24 is a direct result of the industry-wide hiatus in new productions.\nRecent market research* and insights provided by ZOO's customers are consistent and point to a gradual and extended period of recovery through to late 2025, at which point a return to former levels of industry output is expected. The structural dynamics continue to move in ZOO's favour such that the Company remains well positioned for recovery, able to respond quickly to increased customer demand, leading to long-term growth.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nKey Financials\n\u00b7\nRevenue decreased by 55% to $40.6 million (FY23: $90.3 million) due to the industry-wide disruption of 2023 and the hiatus in media production and orders that followed.\n\u00b7\nOperating loss of $19.1 million (FY23: profit of $8.1 million).\n\u00b7\nReported loss before tax of $20.5 million (FY23: profit of $7.9 million).\n\u00b7\nNet cash at year-end of $5.3 million (FY23: $11.8 million), being significantly higher than previous market expectations and which, together with the Company's debt facilities, providing sufficient working capital for FY25.\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nZOO selected by major film and TV distributor as a primary vendor for dubbing and subtitling in FY24; orders now being received, and meaningful contribution expected from FY25.\n\u00b7\nMedia localisation revenues decreased by 52% in the year to $27.2 million (FY23: $56.6\u00a0million), as a direct result of the industry strikes.\n\u00b7\nMedia services revenues decreased by 63% to $11.9\u00a0million (FY23: $32.1\u00a0million), also because of the industry strikes and the associated lack of new content releases.\n\u00b7\nWorldwide freelancer network grew by 4% to 11,952 (FY23: 11,467).\n\u00b7\nStrategic progress in global growth initiative with further investments in India, Turkey and South Korea, in addition to launches in Spain and Italy.\n\u00b7\nOpened new facility in Chennai providing a platform to expand capacity in India in support of the Company's 'follow-the-sun' strategy.\nMarket Highlights\n\u00b7\nHollywood writers' and actors' strikes resolved in September and November 2023 respectively with gradual subsequent resumption in new productions.\n\u00b7\nTotal Hollywood content cash spend declined by 8% in 2023 due to the strikes, forecast to recover by 2025 to levels of the full year pre-strike period of 2022\n*.\n\u00b7\nMedia companies continue to increase focus on episodic programming, international content, and multiple monetisation models.\nCurrent Trading and Outlook\n\u00b7\nImproved trading in FY25Q1 with sales up 35% over the prior quarter.\n\u00b7\nCost reductions implemented in FY24 led to an EBITDA profit for FY25Q1.\n\u00b7\nMajor customers have not yet provided full order schedules for Q3; however, expect further revenue growth and an EBITDA profit in H1.\n\u00b7\nOn track to meet market expectations for the full year.\n\u00b7\nWell positioned in new market environment to deliver long-term growth.\n\u00b7\nA further update will be provided at the AGM on 26 September 2024.\n* Research by market commentator MoffetNathanson\nStuart Green, CEO of ZOO, commented:\n\"It has been a year of unprecedented challenges for the entire film and television entertainment industry as the Hollywood writers and actors strikes brought new productions to a standstill. This has required difficult decisions to conserve cash while positioning the business for the market recovery that is in progress. Customer demand has improved recently as delayed 2023 productions have completed, with ZOO's technology platforms, global reach and trusted reputation positioning us well as the recovery continues.\n\"We view the market disruption as a symptom of a sector undergoing structural change away from linear and towards streaming on demand. With this comes a preference for vendors that can deliver multi-platform, multilingual content across international markets. As one of the few end-to-end vendors with the scale and skillset required by major media companies, we believe that ZOO's model is strategically aligned with the future direction of film and TV streaming.\nThese structural dynamics of the industry continue to move in ZOO's favour such that the Board remains optimistic for the long-term prosperity of the Group.\"\nFor further enquiries pl",

Upon the publication of this Announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n13 May 2024\nZOO DIGITAL GROUP PLC\n(\"ZOO\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading and Debt Facility Renewal Update\nZOO Digital Group plc\u00a0(AIM: ZOO), a\u00a0leading provider of end-to-end cloud-based localisation and media services to the global entertainment industry, today provides an update on trading and its debt facilities.\nDebt Facility and Cash position\nFurther to the trading statement of 26 March 2024, the Company has since renewed for a further twelve months debt facilities of up to $3 million with HSBC. These facilities remain fully undrawn but provide the Company with enhanced financial flexibility for working capital purposes in an improving market environment.\nYear-end net cash on 31 March 2024 was $5.3 million, significantly better than indicated previously following stronger collections than anticipated in the month of March.\nCurrent Trading\nCustomer demand has continued to recover with March 2024 invoicing the highest month since April 2023 following acceleration of the Company's pipeline. Work has continued to expand throughout March and April 2024 and visibility extends to September 2024. Revenues for FY25 Q1 are expected to be 36% up on FY24 Q4 which, together with recently implemented cost savings, is expected to result in EBITDA at break-even in Q1.\nThe Company has now received dubbing and subtitling orders from the major film and TV distributor for which it was recently appointed as a primary vendor as referenced in the announcement of 26 March 2024.\nZOO's strategy remains focused on developing and deploying innovative technology to provide leading and differentiated end-to-end services to its customers. This includes the use of Artificial Intelligence to augment and complement processes where applicable. The strategy is achieved through a capital-efficient approach involving production hubs in key locations to provide a 24/7 service offering, which the Board believes will deliver profitable revenue growth.\nWith market commentators forecasting a return to 2022 levels of entertainment output in 2025, the Board continues to see opportunities to rebuild revenues following the significant industry disruptions of FY24 and is confident of at least meeting FY24 market expectations*.\nNotice of Full Year Results\nThe Company expects to announce full year results for the period to March 2024 in early August 2024.\nThe persons responsible for arranging for the release of this Announcement on behalf of ZOO are Stuart Green, Chief Executive Officer and Phillip Blundell, Chief Financial Officer of ZOO.\n* The Company understands market consensus for FY24 to be revenue of $39.7 million, EBITDA adjusted for share based payments loss of $14.0 million and net cash of $3.7 million.\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nZOO Digital Group plc\n+44\u00a0(0) 114 241 3700\nStuart Green - Chief Executive Officer\nPhillip Blundell - Chief Finance Officer\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7600\nFred Walsh / Erik Anderson\nSinger Capital Markets (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7496 3000\nShaun Dobson / Asha Chotai\nInstinctif Partners (Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 207 457 2020\nMatthew Smallwood / Joe Quinlan\nzoo@instinctif.com\nAbout ZOO Digital Group plc:\nZOO Digital supports major Hollywood studios and streaming services to globalise their content and reach audiences everywhere, by providing leading, technology-enabled localisation and media services.\nFounded in 2001, ZOO Digital operates from hubs in Los Angeles, London, Dubai, Turkey, South Korea, India, Denmark and Spain with a development and production centre in Sheffield, UK.\nThe Group provides media services through its platforms that include: ZOOsubs, ZOOdubs and ZOOstudio.

Upon the publication of this Announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n26 March 2024\nZOO DIGITAL GROUP PLC\n(\"ZOO\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update\nZOO Digital Group plc\u00a0(AIM: ZOO), a\u00a0leading provider of end-to-end cloud-based localisation and media services to the global entertainment industry, today provides an update on trading.\nCurrent Trading\nFollowing the trading statement of 24 January 2024, the Company has since received further clarity on timing of projects and is now receiving orders relating to work on feature films and TV shows that have been completed following the industry strikes of 2023 that brought productions to a halt. With January invoicing the highest month since April 2023, the Company is beginning to see an acceleration of its pipeline with work expanding in March and April 2024.\nAs a result, the Company expects to beat revised market guidance for FY24* with revenues of at least $40 million. Consequently, the anticipated EBITDA loss will be reduced. Net cash on 31 March 2024 is expected to be at least $3 million, also higher than revised market expectations, and although the Company has no debt it intends to renew its current undrawn facilities when they fall due.\nFollowing engagement with its customers, the Company has now secured improved visibility of work, with some extending until September 2024. Many orders are currently in progress and a growing pipeline of further projects over this period has been confirmed. The Company's order book for FY25 Q1 is currently up by 30% on FY24 Q4. This order pipeline from major customers underpins an expectation of a strong recovery in revenues in FY25 H1. Despite the implemented cost savings which have resulted in expected Q1 direct staff costs 30% below the prior year period, the Company is well positioned to take on increased levels of business as the industry reopens.\nAppointment by a major film and TV distributor\nIn February 2024 the Company was appointed by another of the major film and TV distributors as a primary vendor for dubbing in several languages and a preferred partner for subtitling of global languages. The Board expects to receive first firm orders for this new engagement in the coming weeks. Furthermore, due to the strong demand for European dubbing, the Company plans to continue to expand its capabilities in Spain, Italy, and Germany.\nAppointment of Senior Independent Director\nThe Board is pleased to announce that Nathalie Schwarz, who has served as a non-executive director since January 2022, is appointed as the Senior Independent Director. Ms. Schwarz will continue to serve as chair of the Remuneration Committee and member of the Audit Committee.\nThe persons responsible for arranging for the release of this Announcement on behalf of ZOO are Stuart Green, Chief Executive Officer and Phillip Blundell, Chief Financial Officer of ZOO.\n?\n* The Company understands market consensus for FY24 to be revenue of $37.6 million, EBITDA adjusted for share based payments loss of $14.0 million and net cash of $1.6 million.\n?\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nZOO Digital Group plc\n+44\u00a0(0) 114 241 3700\nStuart Green - Chief Executive Officer\nPhillip Blundell - Chief Finance Officer\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7600\nFred Walsh / Erik Anderson / Tom Marsh / Richard Short\nSinger Capital Markets (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7496 3000\nShaun Dobson / Asha Chotai\nInstinctif Partners (Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 207 457 2020\nMatthew Smallwood / Joe Quinlan\nzoo@instinctif.com\nAbout ZOO Digital Group plc:\nZOO Digital supports major Hollywood studios and streaming services to globalise their content and reach audiences everywhere, by providing leading, technology-enabled localisation and media services.\nFounded in 2001, ZOO Digital operates from hubs in Los Angeles, London, Dubai, Turkey, South Korea, India, Denmark and Spain with a development and production centre in Sheffield, UK.\nThe Group provides media services through its platforms that include: ZOOsubs, ZOOdubs and ZOOstudio.

Following resolution in November, production companies have resumed projects with the expectation that the first of these would complete in January, accelerating into February and beyond.\nZOO has now been notified by its largest customer of orders giving a pipeline and confidence of work for the next two quarters which is expected to deliver a strong recovery of revenues, and indicates demand for services and languages that are aligned with ZOO's investment strategy. However, it is now clear that the completion of entertainment products is taking longer than expected. This will result in Q4 revenue being significantly lower than anticipated leading to a greater loss than previously expected for the full year.\nThe pipeline is consistent with current market expectations for FY25 and a return to profitability.\nOn 31 December 2023, the Group had net cash of $8.9 million and expects to maintain a positive balance with unused debt facilities available at the March year-end and an improving cash balance in the first half of FY25 due to the recommencement of orders.\nThe Board expects further clarity on the timing of projects and therefore revenue for the rest of the year in the coming weeks and will update the market further as necessary in due course.\nThe persons responsible for arranging for the release of this Announcement on behalf of ZOO are Stuart Green, Chief Executive Officer and Phillip Blundell, Chief Financial Officer of ZOO.\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nZOO Digital Group plc\n+44\u00a0(0) 114 241 3700\nStuart Green - Chief Executive Officer\nPhillip Blundell - Chief Finance Officer\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7600\nFred Walsh / Erik Anderson / Tom Marsh / Richard Short\nSinger Capital Markets (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7496 3000\nShaun Dobson / Asha Chotai\nInstinctif Partners (Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 207 457 2020\nMatthew Smallwood / Joe Quinlan\nzoo@instinctif.com\nAbout ZOO Digital Group plc:\nZOO Digital supports major Hollywood studios and streaming services to globalise their content and reach audiences everywhere, by providing leading, technology-enabled localisation and media services.\nFounded in 2001, ZOO Digital operates from hubs in Los Angeles, London, Dubai, Turkey, South Korea, India, Denmark and Spain with a development and production centre in Sheffield, UK.\nThe Group provides media services through its platforms that include: ZOOsubs, ZOOdubs and ZOOstudio.

This temporary disruption has had a significant impact across our sector and the wider media and entertainment industry, resulting in artificially low production volumes in the short-term. While this has had a significant impact on our financial performance, we have taken targeted measures to conserve cash while positioning the business to recover rapidly once orders return to more usual levels.\n\"As the streaming industry focuses increasingly on profitability, we are already seeing evidence that major buyers are relying on fewer vendors and prioritising those with end-to-end capacity and scale. This puts ZOO in a strong position to process higher volumes of work from customers over time, particularly as we make strategic investments in customers' high-priority growth regions.\n\"With the resolution of the strikes, we look to the future with optimism and anticipate a phased return of orders in the second half, accelerating into FY25. We remain confident in the industry's long-term structural growth drivers and our role as a trusted partner to many of the world's largest entertainment companies.\"\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nZOO Digital Group plc\n+44\u00a0(0) 114 241 3700\nStuart Green - Chief Executive Officer\nPhillip Blundell - Chief Finance Officer\nKam Bansil - Investor Relations\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7600\nFred Walsh / Erik Anderson / Tom Marsh / Richard Short\nSinger Capital Markets (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7496 3000\nShaun Dobson / Asha Chotai\nInstinctif Partners (Financial PR)\n+44 (0) 207 457 2020\nMatthew Smallwood / Joe Quinlan\nzoo@instinctif.com\nAnalyst and Investor Presentations\nAn interim results presentation will be made available on the Company's website at\nwww.zoodigital.com\n.\nThe Company will be hosting an in-person event for analysts at 9:30am GMT on Thursday 30 November at the offices of Instinctif Partners in London.

Zoo Digital has made significant investments in technology to improve its workflows, particularly with AI and cloud-based systems. This can enhance its scalability, improve turnaround times, and drive cost efficiencies. Automation and AI-based tools could give Zoo a competitive edge and allow it to cater to more clients at a lower cost, driving growth. Will Amazon Prime Video deal come off ? Zoo Digital has been growing its client base, which includes some of the world's largest content creators and distributors. Expanding its roster of clients, particularly with big players in the entertainment and tech industries, could help the company increase revenue and strengthen its position in the market. The global streaming market is growing rapidly, with companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and others pushing for more localized content to cater to international audiences. As the demand for localized content (subtitles, dubbing, etc.) increases, Zoo Digital, which specializes in these services, stands to benefit. The company's core business model directly supports this growing trend. The rise in global content consumption is pushing the need for companies like Zoo Digital that offer language and localization services. Zoo Digital helps its clients adapt content for various regions, which is crucial for reaching a diverse international audience. As more companies prioritize global expansion, the need for localization services will likely increase. Zoo Digital operates in a competitive industry, where there are numerous players offering similar services (subtitling, dubbing, and localization). Competitors may offer lower prices, more advanced technology, or greater scalability, which could impact Zoo's market share. Larger players might seek to acquire smaller companies like Zoo Digital to expand their capabilities.",

Also \"Whilst the Company's order book has improved in recent months through the addition of several high value projects, these are not included in the Company's current expectations for FY25. The timing of revenue recognition for these projects is uncertain as commencement for much of this work is dependent on the supply of original assets from licensors\" I read this to mean that they excluded these contract from FY25 Revenue due to uncertainty but there is a possibility that they could be included, which, if they are could materially increase revenue ans profit for FY25?",

I am confident the business is now well positioned for the next phase of its development as we are repositioned for growth and ZOO has my full support as a shareholder.\"\nNathalie Schwarz, Senior Independent Director and Chair-designate, said:\n\"On behalf of the Board and the Company, I would like to thank Gillian and Mickey for their significant contributions to ZOO Digital.

Other avenues could open up , for example podcasts ? links with companies like audioboom ?, youtube content creators? etc.. Mtk Cap of 12m seems low.

Other avenues could open up , for example podcasts ? links with companies like audioboom ?, youtube content creators? etc.. Mtk Cap of 12m seems low.

Other avenues could open up , for example podcasts ? links with companies like audioboom ?, youtube content creators? etc.. Mtk Cap of 12m seems low.

IMO  zoom can now provide fast turnaround to almost near live  content using its new AI integrated  workflow,  ensuring  the vital \"Human in the loop\" quality  , it could be a great opportunity. Other avenues could open up , for example podcasts ? links with companies like audioboom ?, youtube content creators? etc.. Mtk Cap of 12m seems low. Some other points from interim : o  First premium Fast Track projects delivered and proven for global streaming service. o  Dubbing delivered in 24 hours (typical industry delivery timelines of 2 to 3 weeks). o  Subtitling delivered in 3 hours (typical industry delivery timelines of 1 to 2 weeks). o  Higher-margin service deploys workflow technology with \"Human in the Loop\" to uphold premium quality of output. o  Completed several localisation projects attracting high viewing figures; demand now expanding beyond localisation to ZOO's full end-to-end services. o  Additional projects underway covering sporting events and near live content launches. \u00b7 AI integrated into multiple workflows. o  Explicit customer approval for adoption of AI in localisation within ZOO's secure and trusted framework. o  Efficiencies now being delivered with cost savings shared with customers",
