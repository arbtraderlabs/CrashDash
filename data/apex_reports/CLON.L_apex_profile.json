David was a cofounder and chairman of Clontarf Energy Plc, cofounder and chairman of Petrel Resources Plc a cofounder and director of Botswana Diamonds Plc and founder chairman of Greenore Gold Plc.\nDavid, aged 66 at the time of his death, was born in Belfast, had his Primary Education in Dublin, his High School in British Colombia, received a first-class honours law graduate from Cambridge in England and obtained a Master's in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.\nHis early professional career was overseas with the Boston Consulting Group. He returned to Ireland in 1991 to pursue his interest in Natural Resources. After a short period with Goffs, he joined Kenmare Resources where he became Commercial Director until 1992 when he joined John Teeling and Jim Finn with their stable of resource companies based in Clontarf, in Dublin.\nJohn Teeling and Jim Finn, in a joint comment, \"The death of David Horgan is a deep personal loss to each of us. In over three decades together we have created, financed, managed and listed a series of early-stage exploration ventures in a variety of natural resources. He revelled in high stakes, high risk resources exploration. He was fearless travelling in dangerous territories, traipsing across swamps or exploring long abandoned mines. He spoke eight languages. After ten days or so in a new country could converse with locals in their own language and actively participate in local culture and traditions.\nEarly-stage exploration is very high risk. Our small group had some successes operating gold mines in Zimbabwe, selling off oil licences in Peru and discovering a diamond mine in Botswana. The last decade has been hard on explorers. Little or no investor interest in our activities. David had a simple message - no exploration, no mines, no transition to green energy. His passing, just as the message seems to be getting traction, is ironic. He is a huge loss for his friends, family, colleagues, shareholders and the wider Irish Resource sector.\nAr dheis de go raibh a ainm\".\nFollowing the loss of David, the Board will consider how it is best structured going forward and will update as and when appropriate.\nENDS\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://clontarfenergy.com\nor contact:\nClontarf Energy\nJim Finn, Director\nPeter O'Toole, Director\n+353 (0) 1 833 2833\nNominated & Financial Adviser\nStrand Hanson Limited\nRory Murphy\nRitchie Balmer\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nBroker\nNovum Securities Limited\nColin Rowbury\n+44 (0) 207 399 9400\nPublic Relations\nBlytheRay\nMegan Ray\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nTeneo\nLuke Hogg\nMolly Mooney\nCiara McNamee\n+353 (0) 1 661 4055\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

We now have the technical and commercial confidence to build larger-scale production plants, whether in Bolivia or elsewhere, as soon as legal and commercial requirements are satisfied.\n\u00b7\nThe Magnesium breakthrough may enable development of salares, in additional countries, that would not have been economic at current prices through production of their Lithium content alone.\n\u00b7\nConcern over security of supply of both mining and processing of Critical Resource Minerals is now mainstream - not just in Japan and China, but also in the USA and Europe. Off-takers are now more open to financing arrangements for juniors, while EU funding is available for infrastructural development.\n\u00b7\nThe next stage is to complete and implement the revised Memorandum of Understanding, and process further even larger brine volumes containing Magnesium as well as traditional salts through the pilot-plant in India.\n\u00b7\nThere is strong market interest in long-term offtake contracts for reliable, high-purity clean Lithium and Magnesium from brines - at higher than current spot prices.\nChairman's Statement\nRecent months have witnessed accelerated work on Clontarf's key projects on several fronts.\nAttitudes and management of Critical Resource Minerals are being transformed worldwide, as players grasp the scale and importance of securing adequate supplies of clean materials. We believe there are inadequate fresh projects to deliver the anticipated demand.\nOfftakers worldwide are now keenly aware of the need to secure reliable, clean and competitive materials. It is hard to express how procurement attitudes have changed since 2000 - prompted by a successful Chinese industrial policy, which Europe and the USA have now been forced to counter.\nHistorically, Washington and Brussels have been thought of as slow-moving behemoths, but the fast adoption and funding of the USA's Inflation Reduction Act, and the EU Commission's Critical Resource Minerals Act, shows how fast policy-makers can move when realisation of vulnerability dawns. The EU Commission has pulled together a \"Team Europe\" of explorers, miners, processors and financiers to deliver some measure of materials diversity.\nThe EU Commission's 'dream-team' focuses on practical steps necessary to reduce dependence on mining and processing in potentially hostile regions. Included are financiers, refiners, chemical production experts, state and EU players, as well as explorers and developers. It is the Board's belief that operators like Clontarf are key to achieving these objectives.\nBolivia has committed itself to becoming a key supplier to all key markets. This requires urgent de-bottlenecking of licensing, clearer legal title, financing arrangements and high-throughput production of battery-grade Lithium salts. For example, Clontarf saw how EU Global Gateway funds can provide 20-year money at circa 3% interest for state-allocated infrastructure projects to support new operations in fresh regions. This effectively funds two-thirds of total capex, while meeting EU controls and respecting Bolivian sovereignty.\nOur process does not use significant volumes of fresh water, involve high electricity use or toxic chemicals, but there are sensitivities surrounding some alternative technologies used by other companies. Accordingly, all participating companies have been discreet on progress in country.\nSince late-2024, the authorities have focused on the\nmaturity of the technology\noffered, especially whether an operating pilot plant is already commissioned - as well as financial criteria. This makes sense, since a proven Direct Lithium Extraction (\"DLE\") technology can be funded by offtakers, who are keen to secure supplies of battery-grade Lithium. With proven technologies, many companies will be in a position to negotiate development contracts.\nFollowing technical breakthroughs at our pilot facilities, we have worked on the chemical and operating engineering necessary to scale-up the process, while maintaining high quality and competitive costs. Once the authorities are comfortable with, and sign-off on this more detailed engineering phase, we anticipate early despatch of large bulk samples, to be followed by site-visits to pilot-plants, as originally planned.\nThe recent Bolivian elections signalled a shift to more pro-business policies in order to accelerate growth, including the growth of commodity exports as well as to resolve consumer shortages due to a controlled currency and subsidies.\nIf confirmed in the second round scheduled for October 2025, it is likely that the new administration will accelerate reform of the Lithium Law. Similar arguments suggest reform of the Hydrocarbon Law, which would end the 20-year exploration strike and re-open efforts to tap Bolivia's substantial gas and condensate potential. Last time exploration was pursued vigorously, from 1995 through 2000, Bolivian achieved the world's 2nd largest addition of oil & gas barrels equivalent (after Angola).\nPositive test results have encouraged us to further expand bulk testing, especially for the improved Magnesium extraction techniques.\nClontarf has sourced the required Intermediate Bulk\u00a0Containers (\"IBCs\"), to ship the bulk samples to Mumbai, in whatever volumes are agreed.\nThe Company originally planned to deploy a pilot-plant to one or more Bolivian salares during summer 2024. Because of logistics and weather issues, the Bolivian authorities opted for the operating companies to remain in their original plant location, until YLB could conduct due diligence visits.\nOn arrival at our partners' Indian plant which is expected to occur about 2 months after export, the Bolivian bulk samples will be expedited through the production process. Larger bulk samples will help us plan to optimise recovery and throughput not just for Lithium, but also for Magnesium and other economic minerals.\nAssuming positive results, we are proposing to open agreement negotiations as soon as appropriate. Clontarf Energy is hoping to deploy a pilot plant (at a scale of 500 tonnes / year) to a Bolivian site for arrival ideally by mid-2026 (i.e. six to seven months after arrival of the bulk samples at the Indian plant), after which it will be promptly commissioned, connected to power and brine sources, under applicable laws,\u00a0and\u00a0start\u00a0work. All such schedules are subject to permitting and applicable rules.\nLonger-term, the Company plans to deploy an additional production plant to a total of five separate salares, adding a new plant every six months. Our plant size will accord with any restrictions under law, initially at a scale of 500 tonnes / year.\nClontarf Energy's long-term aim is to produce 150,000 tonnes of LCE by 2030.\nFunding\nClontarf has successfully tapped the financial markets when necessary. Subject to technical verification and permitting of its exploration projects, Clontarf is confident of adequate funding, whether in London or Australia, for near to medium-term ongoing activities. Our preference, where possible, is to avoid dilution by relying on offtakers or EU institutions for necessary infrastructural support.\nIt is our belief that the projected offtaker demand for clean high-purity Lithium cannot be met without Bolivian supplies.\nDavid Horgan\nChairman\n9th September 2025\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSix Months Ended\nYear Ended\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAdministrative expenses\n(158)\n(334)\n(592)\nImpairment of exploration and evaluation assets\n(87)\n(69)\n(173)\nLOSS BEFORE TAXATION\n(245)\n(403)\n(765)\nIncome Tax\n-\n-\n-\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE PERIOD\n(245)\n(403)\n(765)\nLOSS PER SHARE - basic and diluted\n(0.003p)\n(0.01p)\n(0.01p)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nASSETS:\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nIntangible assets\n434\n625\n521\nInvestment in Joint Venture\n888\n888\n888\n1,322\n1,513\n1,409\nCURRENT ASSETS\nOther receivables\n39\n-\n13\nCash and cash equivalents\n579\n601\n818\n618\n601\n831\nTOTAL ASSETS\n1,940\n2,114\n2,240\nLIABILITIES:\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nTrade and other liabilities\n(1,356)\n(1,439)\n(1,411)\n(1,356)\n(1,439)\n(1,411)\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n(1,356)\n(1,439)\n(1,411)\nNET LIABILITES\n584\n675\n829\nEQUITY\nCalled-up share capital\n6,509\n6,409\n6,509\nShare premium\n13,517\n13,195\n13,517\nShare based payment reserve\n825\n731\n825\nRetained deficit\n(20,267)\n(19,660)\n(20,022)\nTOTAL EQUITY\n584\n675\n829\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nCalled-up\nShare based\nShare\nShare\nPayment\nRetained\nCapital\nPremium\nReserves\nDeficit\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAs at 1 January 2024\n6,209\n12,737\n615\n(19,257)\n304\nShares issued\n200\n500\n700\nShare issue expenses\n-\n(42)\n-\n-\n(42)\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n116\n-\n116\nTotal comprehensive income\n(403)\n(403)\nAs at 30 June 2024\n6,409\n13,195\n731\n(19,660)\n675\nShares issued\n100\n350\n-\n-\n450\nShare issue expenses\n-\n(28)\n-\n-\n(28)\nShare based payment charge\n94\n94\nTotal comprehensive income\n-\n(362)\n(362)\nAs at 31 December 2024\n6,509\n13,517\n825\n(20,022)\n829\nTotal comprehensive income\n-\n-\n-\n(245)\n(245)\nAs at 30 June 2025\n6,509\n13,517\n825\n(20,267)\n584\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW\nSix Months Ended\nYear Ended\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCASH FLOW USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nLoss for the period\n(245)\n(403)\n(765)\nImpairment of exploration and evaluation assets\n87\n69\n173\nShare based payment charge\n-\n116\n210\nExchange movements\n-\n1\n3\n(158)\n(217)\n(379)\nIncrease in other receivables\n(26)\n-\n(13)\nDecrease in trade and other payables\n(55)\n(21)\n(49)\nMOVEMENTS IN WORKING CAPITAL\n(81)\n(21)\n(62)\nNET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n(239)\n(238)\n(441)\nCASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nPayments for intangible assets\n-\n-\n-\nNET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n-\n-\n-\nCASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nIssue of shares\n-\n700\n1,150\nShare issue expenses\n-\n(42)\n(70)\nNET CASH GENERATED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n-\n658\n1,080\nNET (DECREASE)/INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n(239)\n420\n639\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n818\n182\n182\nExchange loss on cash and cash equivalents\n-\n(1)\n(3)\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT AT THE END OF THE PERIOD\n579\n601\n818\nNotes:\n1.

The directors are aware that by its nature there is an inherent uncertainty in exploration and evaluation assets and therefore inherent uncertainty in relation to the carrying value of capitalised exploration and evaluation assets.\nDuring 2018 the Group resolved the outstanding issues with the Ghana National Petroleum Company (GNPC) regarding a contract for the development of the Tano 2A Block. The Group has signed a Petroleum Agreement in relation to the block and this agreement awaits ratification by the Ghanian government.\nAs ratification has not yet been achieved,, as a matter of prudence, the directors opted to write down 20% of the carrying value of the Tano 2A Block historic expenditure. Accordingly, an impairment charge of \u00a3173,609 was recorded in the prior and \u00a386,805 in the current period.\nThe directors believe that there were no facts or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the remaining intangible assets may exceed their recoverable amount and thus no impairment review was deemed necessary by the directors. The realisation of these intangibles assets is dependent on the successful discovery and development of economic deposit resources and the ability of the Group to raise sufficient finance to develop the projects. It is subject to a number of potential significant risks, as set out below.\nThe Group's activities are subject to a number of significant potential risks including:\n\u00b7\nlicence obligations;\n\u00b7\nexchange rate risks;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties over development and operational costs;\n\u00b7\npolitical and legal risks, including agreements with Governments for licences, profit sharing and taxation;\n\u00b7\nforeign investment risks including increases in taxes, royalties and renegotiation of contracts;\n\u00b7\ntitle to assets;\n\u00b7\nfinancial risk management;\n\u00b7\ngoing concern; and\n\u00b7\nability to raise finance.\n5.

We now have the technical and commercial confidence to build larger-scale production plants, whether in Bolivia or elsewhere, as soon as legal and commercial requirements are satisfied.\n\u2022 The Magnesium breakthrough may enable development of salares, in additional countries, that would not have been economic at current prices through production of their Lithium content alone.\n\u2022 Concern over security of supply of both mining and processing of Critical Resource Minerals is now mainstream in the USA and Europe. Off-takers are now open to financing arrangements, while EU funding is available for infrastructural development.\n\u2022 The next stage is to complete the Memorandum of Understanding, and process further large brine volumes through the pilot-plant.\nENDS\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://clontarfenergy.com\nor contact:\nClontarf Energy\nDavid Horgan, Chairman\nJim Finn, Director\n+353 (0) 1 833 2833\nNominated & Financial Adviser\nStrand Hanson Limited\nRory Murphy\nRitchie Balmer\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nBroker\nNovum Securities Limited\nColin Rowbury\n+44 (0) 207 399 9400\nPublic Relations\nBlytheRay\nMegan Ray\n+44 (0) 207 138 3206\nTeneo\nLuke Hogg\nMolly Mooney\n+353 (0) 1 661 4055\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
