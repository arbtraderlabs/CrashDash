Over the course of the three-day event, Alludium engaged with investors, operators, founders, and enterprise leaders, providing an early preview of its platform and outlining how AI agents can be applied to improve operational efficiency within modern organisations.\nMembers of the Alludium team contributed to the event's programme with a masterclass focused on the application of AI agents within venture capital operations. The session generated interest from investors and operators seeking to incorporate agent-driven automation into core workflows such as deal sourcing, diligence, and portfolio monitoring.\nThroughout the week, Alludium held a series of meetings with venture firms, potential customers, and prospective design partners. Several organisations expressed interest in participating in structured early testing and in developing tailored agent workflows with Alludium.\nJohn Frizelle, CEO of Alludium commented\n:\n\"Web Summit marked an important milestone in Alludium's transition from stealth into a more public phase of engagement. The team continues to onboard selected design partners and is further refining the platform's agent creation and orchestration capabilities ahead of a broader planned release.\"\nAbout Alludium\nAlludium is developing an Agent Operating System that enables users to create, deploy and share custom agents through conversation, no coding required.
