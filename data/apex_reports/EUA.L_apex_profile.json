Not for release, publication or distribution in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws or regulations of such jurisdiction.\n29 December\u00a02025\nEurasia Mining plc\nWest Kytlim Sale & GM Notice\nEurasia Mining plc (\"Eurasia\" or the \"Company\"), the iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium and gold mining company announces the proposed disposal of its West Kytlim mining operations (\"Disposal\").\nA circular (\"Circular\") providing information on the proposed Disposal and giving notice of a general meeting of shareholders to be held at 11:00 a.m. (UK time) on Thursday, 15 January 2026 has been published today. The resolutions will be proposed as ordinary resolutions. Shareholders should read the notice of general meeting at the end of the Circular for the full text of the resolutions and for further details about the General Meeting.\nThe Directors consider that the resolutions to be proposed are in the best interests of shareholders and the Company as a whole and unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe West Kytlim operations are exposed to nationalisation risks as a reciprocal reaction to the indefinite freeze of Russian assets in Europe, and very high operational and disposal taxes. Accordingly, the Directors believe it is in the Company's interests to achieve at least some value from the historically loss-making West Kytlim operation (rather than nothing in case of nationalisation) in order to focus on the Arctic.\n\u00b7\nWest Kytlim has only 0.3% of Eurasia's reserves and resources. In contrast, Eurasia's Arctic assets\nrepresent 99.7%\nof Eurasia's reserves and resources, and benefit from the legally binding agreement signed with Far East and Arctic Development Corporation (\nplease refer to RNS of 6 December 2021) both in terms of Eurasia's investment support in the Arctic and tax benefits, that West Kytlim does not have.\n\u00b7\nThe NPV of NKT Tier-1 Nickel-Copper asset alone is US$1.2-1.7B according to Wardell Armstrong International (Competent Persons Report December 2021). Thus, the Arctic cluster of Eurasia is of a much higher priority for the Group as a whole.\n\u00b7\nA strong base valuation of West Kytlim of US$251M was achieved as a result of a competitive selling process, but because of the current taxation regime in Russia only 5% of the valuation is payable.\n\u00b7\nThe size of Eurasia's reserves and resources is over 300 times larger in the Arctic relative to West Kytlim and combined with the tax benefits in the Arctic, a higher value is expected to be achieved in due course.\nAs well as the Circular, an investor webinar is scheduled for Tuesday, 30 December 2025 at 3:00 p.m. to address all questions and concerns of the shareholders. Christian Schaffalitzky, Executive Chairman, will provide a live investor session\u00a0via the Investor Meet Company platform.\nThe session will allow shareholders to ask the Company questions regarding any queries they currently have. It is the intention to enable shareholders to understand today's announcement on why the Company agreement for the sale of West Kytlim is in the best interest of all stakeholders in Eurasia.\nThe Company will be holding a Q&A session only, with some top-line commentary on the Company's progression at the start. Questions can be submitted pre-event via your Investor Meet Company dashboard.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add to meet\u00a0Eurasia Mining PLC via:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/eurasia-mining-plc/register-investor\nInvestors who follow Eurasia\u00a0on the Investor Meet Company platform will automatically be invited.

The Disposal is subject to a number of conditions including Shareholder approval as described below, and the Circular issued today provides information to Shareholders and seeks their approval of the requisite resolutions at the General Meeting. The terms of the Sale Agreement described below and in the Circular have been agreed in principle with the buyer but will only be entered into once state approval is received.\nThe Disposal follows a sale process and is consistent with the Company's strategy of rationalising its portfolio and prioritising the development of its higher-value assets in the Kola Peninsula in the Arctic region.\nFurthermore, the Arctic assets benefit from the agreement signed with the state owned Far East and Arctic Development Corporation (please refer to RNS of 6 December 2021).\nThe Disposal, if implemented, will generate non-dilutive capital to assist the Group in concentrating on the ongoing development of the Group's remaining assets in the Arctic region, where 99.7% of Eurasia's reserves and resources are located, including the Tier 1 nickel-copper deposit NKT. Also, the Company holds a mining licence at Monchetundra and recently completed a detailed design for its development (please refer to RNS of 1 December 2025).\nThe Transaction places a valuation of the West Kytlim assets of approximately US$251 million, which is line with previous estimates. However, after local regulations and taxes the cash consideration due is 671.2 million RUB (approximately US$9 million) (see further discussion on these taxes below). Whilst this represents a significant discount, the Board believes it is preferable to take this opportunity now. West Kytlim is exposed to potential nationalisation as a possible reciprocal reaction to Russia's assets freeze in Europe for indefinite period of time.\nIn addition, Kosvinsky Kamen will transfer the Travyanaya licence to the Group as part of the transaction - i.e., Eurasia will retain this licence following Completion.\nThe Board believes that the Disposal represents an opportunity to optimise the value of its portfolio and allow the development of the major component of its mineral assets and inventory.\nIn view of the size of the Disposal relative to the size of the Company, the Transaction requires to be approved by Shareholders. Should the Transaction be approved by Shareholders, the Company will NOT become a cash shell and will NOT be required to complete an acquisition which constitutes a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules.\nThe purpose of the Circular is\nto:\n(i) provide Shareholders with information about the background to and the reasons for the Disposal;\n(ii) explain why the Board considers the Disposal to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole; and\n(iii) explain why the Board recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting, notice of which is set out at the end of the Circular.\nGeneral Meeting\nA General Meeting will be held electronically\non\nhttps://meetings.lumiconnect.com/100-367-007-686\nat\n11:00 a.m. on Thursday, 15 January 2026. The Notice convening the General Meeting is set out at the end of the Circular. The Resolutions to approve the Disposal will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and must be passed by a simple majority of votes cast.\nBackground to and reasons for the Disposal\nThe Group holds a portfolio of mining and development brownfield assets in the Urals and in a high-value Arctic mining area in the Kola peninsula, close to the city of Monchegorsk. West Kytlim in the Urals is the Group's only production asset, producing PGM and gold from a surface mine, but is non-core representing only 0.3% of the Group's total Reserves and Resources, while 99.7% are located in the Arctic (Monchetundra-NKT cluster). The Monchetundra detailed design is expected to be approved by all relevant authorities this year, allowing mine development and construction to commence under the EPCF contract with Sinosteel.\nThe sale of the Kosvinsky Kamen shareholding simplifies the Company's portfolio.\nSubject to continued compliance with applicable sanctions legislation,\nthe proceeds of the Disposal may provide capital for the project elements not covered by the EPCF arrangements with Sinosteel. It also removes the current nationalisation and regulatory risks associated with operating in the Urals region.\nEurasia continues to remain compliant with licence obligations at Monchetundra and NKT in the Arctic region, enabling their development to be continued within the expected timeframe and avoiding the risk of licence recall by the authorities. Significantly, all of Eurasia's\nArctic assets benefit from the agreement signed with the state owned Far East and Arctic Development Corporation (please refer to RNS of 6 December 2021).\nIn summary, the Directors believe that the Disposal allows Eurasia to concentrate on its highest-value assets, reduce risk exposure, and pursue its strategic objectives without recourse to shareholder dilution.\nFinancial effects of the Disposal\nThe financial information below has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is extracted from the notes to the Group's audited financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2024, 2023 and 2022 annual reports and relates to the Disposal Group.\nNo adjustments have been made to take account of trading, expenditure or other movements subsequent to 31 December 2024, being the date of the last published historical annual financial information of the Group.\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n61,075\n2,069,262\n6,636,001\nLoss for the year\n(4,397,875)\n(3,196,028)\n(6,024,469)\nNet assets\n14,551,112\n13,968,335\n10,827,117\nThe West Kytlim project has consistently made operating losses to date. Operations and trading for the Disposal Group for the year ending 31 December 2025 have continued in line with results reported for the year ended 31 December 2024 and half year ended 30 June 2025.\nFollowing completion of the Disposal, the Group's financial statements will no longer consolidate the Group's 68% interest in the revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the Disposal Group. Following completion of the Disposal, the Group's activities will comprise exploration and development of the Group's assets in the Arctic region, primarily Monchetundra and NKT, subject to ongoing compliance with sanctions legislation.\nRegulatory framework and statutory valuation\nUnder current state regulations for the sale of Russian mining assets:\n\u00b7\na statutory valuation must be prepared by an approved appraiser;\n\u00b7\na 60% discount is then applied;\n\u00b7\n35% tax is imposed on the pre-discount valuation, payable by the purchaser; and\n\u00b7\nas a result, only 5% of the statutory valuation is payable to the seller.\nThe independent statutory valuation for Kosvinsky Kamen has been agreed in principle at approximately US$251 million. After the discount and tax described above, the total consideration payable will be RUB 671,200,000 (approximately US$9 million) for its 68% share, of which RUB 546,200,000 (approximately US$7.3 million) will be payable prior to completion and the remaining RUB 125,000,000 (approximately US$1.7 million) will be payable within 12 months subject to the non-revocation/extension of certain licences at least for 12 months. In addition, Kosvinsky Kamen will transfer the Travyanaya licence to the Group as part of the transaction - i.e., Eurasia will retain this licence following Completion.\nStrategic case for the Sale\nThe Disposal:\n\u00b7\nMitigates nationalisation and regulatory risks in the Urals.\n\u00b7\nEnables full strategic focus on the Arctic cluster.\n\u00b7\nSupports compliance with licence obligations at Monchetundra (avoiding risk of licence recall).\nThe Disposal will enable the Group to support the Monchetundra project without shareholder dilution, supported by the EPCF arrangements with Sinosteel. It reduces the Group's exposure to nationalisation and other geopolitical risks associated with the Urals and supports compliance with Monchetundra licence obligations. By selling an asset that represents only 0.3% of Eurasia's total Reserves, the Company can focus its resources on the remaining 99.7%, which carry substantially greater value.\nFocusing on the Arctic cluster allows the Group to concentrate its resources on assets that have materially higher value. Independent third-party estimates value the NKT deposit alone at between US$1.2 billion and US$1.7 billion (Wardell Armstrong's Competent Persons Report December 2021).\nThe Company's long-term strategy to dispose of the Group's Russian assets has been in place since before the introduction of the tax regime in late 2024 (described above). In light of more recent geopolitical changes, the board has decided that an opportunity to dispose of West Kytlim, even with such a high effective tax rate, is in the interests of the Company. Although the mandated valuation framework results in a total deduction of approximately 95%, meaning that only around 5% of the statutory valuation is payable to the seller, this amount is preferable to the risk of receiving no value in the event of nationalisation.\nAssuming the Disposal completes, the proceeds will provide a cash buffer that may help sustain the development of the Kola assets and in future support a strategic transaction once the current regulatory excessive tax on Russian asset disposals is removed. The Disposal would allow the Company to sustain and focus on the development of what could become a major mining industry in the Arctic, with the Monchetundra-NKT cluster positioned as a cornerstone asset with a 'first mover' advantage within that landscape. The EPCF agreement with Sinosteel provides a road map for the future.\nNationalisation risk remains a concern for foreign-owned mining assets in Russia, but the Group's assets in the Arctic region benefit from the agreement reached in December 2021 with state owned Far East and Arctic Region Development Corporation.\nSummary\nterms of the Disposal\nThe Buyer (LLC KS Logistics), is a non-sanctioned infrastructure company in Russia\nworking in transportation, infra-structure development, retail sales and information technology development and management.\nThe consideration payable by the Buyer under the Sale Agreement is RUB 671,200,000 (approximately US$9 million). This amount reflects the effect of the Russian regulatory framework introduced in response to geopolitical and sanctions-related conditions, which imposes strict limitations on the proceeds that foreign owners may legally receive from the disposal of Russian assets.\nUnder this framework, a statutory valuation is first required to determine the fair market value of the asset being sold. Once this valuation is established, a mandatory 60% discount is applied as part of the state-controlled pricing mechanism. In addition, a 35% tax is levied on the pre-discount statutory valuation.\nThe combined effect of these mechanisms is that only approximately 5% of the statutory valuation may legally be transferred to the seller. For the purpose of the Disposal, the statutory valuation was approximately US$251 million, and therefore the maximum amount legally receivable - based on its 68% ownership of KK - is approximately US$9 million.\nThis amount represents the full extent of the proceeds that the Company is permitted to receive under the current legal regime and enables Eurasia to unlock value from the Kosvinsky Kamen asset while remaining fully compliant with all the applicable rules and regulations.\nThe consideration is payable as to RUB 546,200,000 (approximately US$7.3 million) prior to completion and the remaining RUB 125,000,000 (approximately US$1.7 million) within 12 months subject to the non-revocation/extension of certain licences at least for 12 months.\nThe Sale Agreement includes customary provisions relating to:\n\u00b7\nthe assets and shares to be sold;\n\u00b7\nconditions precedent to Completion include state approval and corporate approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe consideration payable;\n\u00b7\nliability for past costs, including taxation, is capped at the consideration payable;\n\u00b7\nthe process for Completion;\n\u00b7\npost-Completion obligations;\n\u00b7\ncompany representations; and\n\u00b7\ntermination rights.\nThe Sale Agreement provides for a reciprocal break fee of US$5 million, in the event that the Disposal does not proceed as intended, due to the failure of either party to fulfil the conditions due to matters under their control.\nThe Sale Agreement is under Russian law and disputes are referred to the Russian Institute of Modern Arbitration. Closing is planned before 28 February 2026.\nTerskaya Mining Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, will act as a guarantor for customary representations given in the Sale Agreement (capped in total by the consideration).\nAs a part of the Transaction, Kosvinsky Kamen is transferring to the Group the licence for Travyanaya in the Arctic for a nominal consideration, i.e. Eurasia will retain the licence for Travyanaya after the Disposal.\nThe terms summarised above have been agreed in principle between the parties, but will only be entered into once state approval has been received, and therefore remain subject to final agreement.\nUse\nof Proceeds\nThe Directors believe that the Disposal can provide the Company with working capital in Russia. In conjunction with sanctions legislation, the Company will continue development work at Monchetundra and development at NKT. In particular, it maintains the opportunity to participate in the development of what could become a major mining industry in the Arctic, with the Monchetundra-NKT cluster positioned as a cornerstone asset within that landscape.\nAIM Rule\n15\nIn accordance with AIM Rule 15, in view of the material size of the Disposal, relative to the size of the Group, the Transaction requires to be approved by Shareholders. Should the Transaction be approved by Shareholders, the Company will NOT become a cash shell and will NOT be required to complete an acquisition which constitutes a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules.\nGeneral Meeting\nThe Disposal is conditional upon, amongst other things, Shareholder approval being obtained at the General Meeting.\nA General Meeting will be held electronically on\nhttps://meetings.lumiconnect.com/100-367-007-686\nat 11:00 a.m. on Thursday, 15 January 2026. The Notice convening the General Meeting is set out at the end of the Circular. The Resolutions to approve the Disposal will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and must be passed by a simple majority of votes cast.\nShareholders should read the Notice of General Meeting at the end of the Circular for the full text of the Resolutions and for further details about the General Meeting. The attention of Shareholders is also drawn to the voting intentions of the Directors as set out in the Letter from the Chairman.\nRecommendation\nThe Board believes that the Disposal is consistent with the Group's strategic priorities and reduces exposure to operational and geopolitical risks associated with the Urals region; and allows the Group to streamline its asset base while remaining fully compliant with all applicable rules and regulations.\nFor these reasons, the Board considers the Disposal to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole\nand unanimously recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolutions, as the Directors\nand management\nintend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings, which amount in aggregate to 561,217,013 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 19% of the issued share capital of the\nCompany.\nFurther updates\nFurther updates will be provided as and when the conditions to the Disposal Agreement, including state approval, are satisfied.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In summary, the combined Reserves and Resources totalled 1.9 million ounces of palladium equivalent (palladium and platinum) with important additional gold, nickel and copper, at two open-pittable locations. The state approved totals were granted using the local standard classification. For details of this study please see RNS dated 3 April 2017.\nThe licence was issued to Terskaya Mining Company (TMC), Eurasia's 80% owned subsidiary, and is valid to 7 December 2038, for the extraction of palladium, platinum, gold, nickel and copper.\n\u200b\nDetailed\nDesign Completion\nThe\nTechnical Project\nfor MT was completed by 'Geolinvestproekt', the specialist contractor that previously carried out the detailed design for the West Kytlim mine, obtaining all necessary approvals and overseeing its successful launch.\nGeolinvestproekt brings over 15 years of experience in detailed design, primarily for major mining companies and\nin completing the MT technical project, drew on the following key inputs:\n\u00b7\nResults from comprehensive test programmes by Gipronickel (an engineering arm of Norilsk Nickel) include, but not limited to, physical and mechanical tests to determine the average rock hardness\n, geotechnical studies, hydrology, and the general\nphysical properties of the rocks\nand ores\n.\n\u00b7\nDetailed metallurgical testwork carried out by Mekhanobr Engineering. Mekhanobr Engineering has over 100 years of experience (originating from the Mekhanobr Institute founded in the early 20th century) in the design and engineering of base and precious metals processing plants, mining-and-processing complexes, tailings storage facilities and related infrastructure. More than 250 mining-and-processing operations worldwide have been constructed using Mekhanobr-origin designs and technologies.\n\u00b7\nCompletion of drillhole digital database, wireframe and block modelling, and open pit optimisations,\nincorporating the\ndetailed mining plan\ndeveloped\nby\nthe\nCentral Kola Expedition (\"CKE\"). CKE has extensive Arctic experience, having working for mining majors, including Norilsk Nickel and Rusal as well as for international mining majors including Anglo American, Barrick, B2Gold and Kinross.\nCKE has worked closely with Eurasia for over 20 years since commencing work in the Arctic.\n\u00b7\nWardell Armstrong International's audit of MT drill core storage at the warehouse owned and managed by CKE, together with review of quality assurance and quality control procedures and the work carried out by Gipronickel, CKE and other professional contractors engaged by Eurasia.\n\u200b\nCurrent Status\nGeolinvestproekt is now overseeing the state approval process of the Technical Project, which is now imminent. A separate announcement will be made upon the approval.\n\u200b\nNext Steps\nOnce the Technical Project is approved, the MT mine construction can\ncommence\nfurther to the EPCF turnkey contract signed with Sinosteel, a part of China Baowu Steel Group (Baowu Group). This state-backed merger made Baowu Group the world's largest steelmaker with Sinosteel's expertise in mining, trading and turnkey mine construction bolstering the Baowu Group's portfolio. The financing package is a part of the signed EPCF contract (EPCF stands for Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Financing).\n\u200b\nMore Information\nFor more information on MT, please refer to the latest research report by OAK Securities which was announced via RNS on 22 October 2025 and is available at:\nhttps://www.research-tree.com/companies/uk/industrial-metals-nonferrous/eurasia-mining-plc/research/oak-securities/eurasia-mining-update-/272ec8d2-8293-4368-8c11-4c9aec228a68\nChristian Schaffalitzky, the Executive Chairman commented:\n\"The Directors are pleased that our professional contractors have completed the detailed design for MT, the same contractors that completed the detailed design, had it approved by the state and oversaw the successful launch of our West Kytlim mine.
