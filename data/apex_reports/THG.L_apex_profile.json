FY 2024 has been restated to reflect the demerger of THG Ingenuity.\nQ4 was the strongest quarter of FY 2025 for Group revenue growth at +7.0%, building on the previous quarter high of +6.3%, supported by a successful November and December performance (c.+8%), and robust commercial discipline.\nThe Group delivered FY revenue growth of +2.3%, the first year of growth since 2021, and a pleasing recovery from the H1 revenue decline of -2.5%.\nThe impact of FX on sales reduced sequentially through the year, with Japanese Yen and US Dollar headwinds largely offset by Euro tailwinds by Q4.\nThe combined impact of disposals and discontinued activities reduced Group full year and Q4 2025 revenue growth by 330bps and 290bps respectively.\nTHG Beauty delivered its strongest Q4 growth performance since Q4 2021, well ahead of revenue guidance driven\u00a0by Lookfantastic (+16.2%) in the UK and Ireland.\u00a0The effect of discontinued activities and asset disposals (including the sale of the luxury portfolio) impacted full year and Q4 2025 reported revenue growth by 460bps and 370bps respectively.\nThe sale of Claremont Ingredients in Q3 2025, impacted full year and Q4 2025 revenue growth for THG Nutrition by 50bps and 110bps respectively. We continue to diversify our territory, channel and category mix to reflect the record global consumer demand for protein, taking intentional trading decisions to protect margins and retain market share whilst whey commodity prices remain elevated.\nHighly liquid balance sheet with over \u00a3330m of cash and available facilities at year end.\nTHG Beauty Q4 2025 highlights\nTHG Beauty UK outperformed the market following a strong Q3, supported by growth in new and LTM active customers.\nRevenue growth in Q4 was broad-based across categories, helping deepen penetration in established and high-growth segments. Cosmetics and Skincare drove the strongest performance, with both gaining UK market share\n[4]\n, alongside a record advent contribution.\nLookfantastic has partnered with Uber Eats, allowing London based customers access to same day delivery for a range of curated beauty and fragrance essentials, further supporting our focus on streamlining the product discovery and purchase experience.\nWithin Own Brands, Perricone MD performance improved in the period after a challenging H1, driven by investment in brand and formulation, alongside expanded B2B distribution. In addition, 60 ESPA SKUs were launched in over 100 M&S stores and online, building brand visibility and aided awareness for the luxury spa and skincare brand, leveraging access to the Sparks reward scheme members.\nThe sale of the luxury portfolio and other asset disposals, alongside the commercial decision to withdraw from certain sales activity in\nEurope\nand\nAsia, accounts for the vast majority of the revenue drag observed during FY 2025. These factors have now largely annualised.\nTHG Nutrition Q4 2025 highlights\nTHG Nutrition delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth (+12.2% (excluding Asia)), largely driven by pricing and strong growth in adjacent categories notably offline retail and gross margin accretive activewear and creatine. Growth in activewear (c.12% of online sales vs c.8% FY 2024) further diversifies both revenue and the addressable customer base, with over half a million women's leggings sold during the year.\nMyprotein maintained its leading position as UK and Europe's no.1 sports nutrition brand\n[5]\nholding a 25% share of the UK online sports nutrition market\n[6]\n, with customer loyalty driving YoY growth in subscriptions by more than double.\nGlobal confectionary brand Mars joined a growing list of international collaborations for Myprotein, which already includes\nM\u00fcller\n, Iceland, Chupa Chups, Vimto and Jimmy's Coffee. These partnerships have seen the brand enter new markets alongside established category leaders, helping to bring Myprotein products to a wider audience across multiple lifestyle and nutrition categories.\nLong-term retail partner Iceland launched 25 new Myprotein branded products into stores during the year, with the recent launch of omelettes and 'Layered Ice Cream Bars' incorporating Myprotein into additional meal occasions. Range expansions for GNC and Kroger in the US are also set to launch in H1 2026.\nMatthew Moulding, CEO of THG, commented:\n\"We finished 2025 on a high with our best quarter of the year thanks to a strong November and December period. In THG Beauty, our strategy to focus on core categories and territories is delivering clear results, with Lookfantastic UK achieving exceptional growth. We continue to accelerate our digital leadership, prioritising high-margin prestige brands and enhancing personalisation by increased use of AI and virtual tools.\n\"THG Nutrition has delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, driven by the strength of the Myprotein brand and our successful offline global expansion strategy which has seen us exceed our distribution targets across retail and licencing.\n\"We enter the new year with strong trading momentum and a clear focus on continuing to deliver quality, value and newness for our customers.\"\nAnalyst and Institutional investor conference call\nTHG will today host a conference call and webcast for analysts and investors at 9.00am (UK time) via the following link:\nhttps://stream.brrmedia.co.uk/broadcast/695cfa5b87ddc40013b867a5\nTo ask questions, you must dial in via conference line using the below details:\n\u200b\nUK-Wide: +44 (0) 33 0551 0200\nUK Toll Free: 0808 109 0700\nUSA Local: +1 786 697 3501\nUSA Toll Free: 866 580 3963\nPassword: THG - Q4 2025 Results\nFor further information please contact:\nInvestor enquiries - THG PLC\nKate Grimoldby, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Projects\nInvestor.relations@thg.com\nMedia enquiries:\nSodali & Co - Financial PR adviser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7100 6451\nRuss Lynch/Sam Austrums/Louisa Henry\nthg@sodali.com\nTHG PLC\nmedia-enquiries@thg.com\nNotes to Editors\nTHG PLC is a global e-commerce group and brand owner headquartered in Manchester, UK, which operates through two leading consumer businesses: THG Beauty and THG Nutrition.\nTHG Beauty operates prominent online platforms including Lookfantastic, Dermstore and Cult Beauty, offering a valued route to market for over 1,000 third-party brands, alongside a specialist portfolio of owned brands.\nTHG Nutrition, led by Myprotein, the world's largest online sports nutrition brand, spans multiple health and wellness categories, delivering its products both directly to consumers and through strategic offline partnerships worldwide.\nCautionary Statement\nCertain statements included within this announcement may constitute \"forward-looking statements\"\nin respect of the group's operations, performance, prospects and/or financial condition.
