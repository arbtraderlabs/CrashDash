The collaboration will introduce a new range of Myprotein branded food on-the-go items, significantly expanding the brand's presence in offline retail channels and continuing its successful 6 aisle strategy of launching new licensing agreements with best-in-class partners.\nThe range will include protein-enriched salads and wraps, with scope to expand into other profiles and formats, helping consumers access convenient, nutritious meals that align with their fitness and healthy lifestyle goals. These products will be available in Sainsbury's supermarkets and convenience stores.\nThe Greencore partnership forms part of Myprotein's wider strategic ambition to grow its offline and licensing footprint to 100,000 doors, allowing for deeper penetration with existing retail partners and accelerated expansion within the convenience channel. Food-to-go represents a high-frequency, high-visibility consumption occasion that complements Myprotein's existing protein portfolio, covering powders, dairy and desserts, bars and snacks and ready-to-drink, broadening consumer touchpoints beyond the gym and home.\nLicensing agreements with category leaders including M\u00fcller, Iceland and Jimmy's Coffee, led to sales of over 43 million Myprotein units into retail during 2025. This strategy leverages its global brand recognition alongside specialised manufacturing and distribution expertise.\nNeil Mistry, CEO of THG Nutrition, commented:\n\"This collaboration is another step in Myprotein's global leadership across sports nutrition, adding Greencore's expertise in creating and distributing fresh, on-the-go food to our growing list of partners.\n\"The range builds on the demand of GLP-1 consumers, along with trends towards cleaner nutrition combined with protein-rich foods and snacks. This partnership not only widens the reach of the Myprotein brand offering, it brings further significant penetration into offline channels.\n\"Following a strong start to the year across our licensed ranges, we expect to significantly build on last year's performance, with the brand on target to sell-in over 60 million licensed products in 2026, up from 43 million in 2025.\"\nAndy Parton, Chief Commercial Officer of Greencore, commented:\n\"We're thrilled to partner with Myprotein to bring high\n\u2011\nquality, protein\n\u2011\nrich food\n\u2011\nto\n\u2011\ngo options to consumers across the UK. As demand grows for convenient, nutritious products that support healthier lifestyles, this collaboration allows us to combine Greencore's expertise in fresh, ready\n\u2011\nto\n\u2011\neat food with one of the most recognisable brands in sports nutrition. We're excited about the potential of this partnership and look forward to expanding the range together.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nInvestor enquiries - THG PLC\nKate Grimoldby, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Projects\nInvestor.relations@thg.com\nMedia enquiries:\nSodali & Co - Financial PR adviser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7100 6451\nRuss Lynch/Sam Austrums/Louisa Henry\nthg@sodali.com\nTHG PLC\nmedia-enquiries@thg.com\nNotes to Editors\nTHG PLC is a global e-commerce group and brand owner headquartered in Manchester, UK, which operates through two leading consumer businesses: THG Beauty and THG Nutrition.\nTHG Beauty operates prominent online platforms including Lookfantastic, Dermstore and Cult Beauty, offering a valued route to market for over 1,000 third-party brands, alongside a specialist portfolio of owned brands.\nTHG Nutrition, led by Myprotein, the world's largest online sports nutrition brand, spans multiple health and wellness categories, delivering its products both directly to consumers and through strategic offline partnerships worldwide.\nEnds\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

Cosmetics and Skincare drove the strongest performance, with both gaining UK market share\n[4]\n, alongside a record advent contribution.\nLookfantastic has partnered with Uber Eats, allowing London based customers access to same day delivery for a range of curated beauty and fragrance essentials, further supporting our focus on streamlining the product discovery and purchase experience.\nWithin Own Brands, Perricone MD performance improved in the period after a challenging H1, driven by investment in brand and formulation, alongside expanded B2B distribution. In addition, 60 ESPA SKUs were launched in over 100 M&S stores and online, building brand visibility and aided awareness for the luxury spa and skincare brand, leveraging access to the Sparks reward scheme members.\nThe sale of the luxury portfolio and other asset disposals, alongside the commercial decision to withdraw from certain sales activity in\nEurope\nand\nAsia, accounts for the vast majority of the revenue drag observed during FY 2025. These factors have now largely annualised.\nTHG Nutrition Q4 2025 highlights\nTHG Nutrition delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth (+12.2% (excluding Asia)), largely driven by pricing and strong growth in adjacent categories notably offline retail and gross margin accretive activewear and creatine. Growth in activewear (c.12% of online sales vs c.8% FY 2024) further diversifies both revenue and the addressable customer base, with over half a million women's leggings sold during the year.\nMyprotein maintained its leading position as UK and Europe's no.1 sports nutrition brand\n[5]\nholding a 25% share of the UK online sports nutrition market\n[6]\n, with customer loyalty driving YoY growth in subscriptions by more than double.\nGlobal confectionary brand Mars joined a growing list of international collaborations for Myprotein, which already includes\nM\u00fc",

These partnerships have seen the brand enter new markets alongside established category leaders, helping to bring Myprotein products to a wider audience across multiple lifestyle and nutrition categories.\nThis latest collaboration forms part of Myprotein's broader strategy to grow its presence in both offline retail and licensing, with ambitions to sell 45 million units globally through over 40,000 retail doors by the end of 2025.\nNeil Mistry, CEO of THG Nutrition commented:\n\"We're incredibly excited to be strengthening our partnership with Mars and introducing a new wave of great-tasting, high-quality products to our ever-growing range. This collaboration brings together two trusted brands: combining Myprotein's expertise in sports nutrition with Mars' iconic flavours that customers already know and love.\n\"For our existing community, it means more ways to enjoy performance-led nutrition without compromise - an authentic blend of taste, nostalgia and function. It's also a clear point of difference in the market, offering consumers genuine brand partnerships that deliver both quality and credibility.\n\"At Myprotein, we're continually pushing the boundaries of innovation; from flavour development to new formats and breakthrough formulas, ensuring we stay at the forefront of the industry and continuing to set the standard for what modern nutrition can be.\"\nKerry Cavanaugh, general manager for Mars Drinks and Treats, commented:\n\"This is a huge opportunity to bring new consumers to the category through the familiarity of our brands and their trusted taste. Particularly with Snickers which consistently ranks as the number one selling chocolate bar in the world.\n\"The UK has the third-largest market for eCommerce in the world, and over 40% of all UK supplement sales are made online. As protein products remain the fastest growing segment of the protein market with a projected CAGR of 7% between 2024-2029 in the UK, Myprotein is the perfect partner for us to introduce more online shoppers to our range of Mars branded protein products.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nInvestor enquiries - THG PLC\nKate Grimoldby, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Projects\nInvestor.relations@thg.com\nMedia enquiries:\nSodali & Co - Financial PR adviser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7100 6451\nRuss Lynch/Sam Austrums/Louisa Henry\nthg@sodali.com\nTHG PLC\nmedia-enquiries@thg.com\nNotes to Editors\nTHG PLC is a global e-commerce group and brand owner headquartered in Manchester, UK, which operates through two leading consumer businesses: THG Beauty and THG Nutrition.\nTHG Beauty operates prominent online platforms including Lookfantastic, Dermstore and Cult Beauty, offering a valued route to market for over 1,000 third-party brands, alongside a specialist portfolio of owned brands.\nTHG Nutrition, led by Myprotein, the world's largest online sports nutrition brand, spans multiple health and wellness categories, delivering its products both directly to consumers and through strategic offline partnerships worldwide.\nEnds\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

The largest of these factors has now annualised.\n\u00b7\nAs part of the lifecycle investment in own brands, the refined Ameliorate product range launched in Q3 in D2C and offline channels. Aligned to the Group's sustainability goals, the range now uses Prevented Ocean PlasticTM (POP) in its product packaging.\nTHG Nutrition Q3 2025 highlights\n\u00b7\n+10.0% YoY, the highest revenue growth rate in over 2 years, with growth in online and offline channels.

This momentum underpins confidence in full year and medium-term outlook.\nThe successful THG Ingenuity demerger at the start of H1 alongside the Q3 disposal of Claremont Ingredients to Nactarome Group for \u00a3103m, puts the Group on an accelerated path towards a net cash position, with the H1 2025 refinancing securing long-term committed facilities.\nKey financial headlines\n\u00b7\nGroup revenue: \u00a3783.4m (-2.6% CCY YoY\n[1]\n)\n\u00b7\nGross margin: 41.1%\n[2]\n(H1 2024: 42.6%), reflecting whey price impact. Gross margins expected to return to growth in H2\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA: \u00a324.0m (H1 2024: \u00a337.1m), in line with August 2025 trading update. The result was weighted towards\nQ2, with Q3 expected to be meaningfully higher, reflecting positive H1 exit momentum\n\u00b7\nCash and available facilities of \u00a3279.4m following the H1 2025 refinancing which substantially reduced gross debt. This increases by c.\u00a3103m proforma for the received disposal proceeds of Claremont Ingredients\n\u00b7\nStrongest trading performance of FY 2025 so far in Q3, with guidance unchanged:\no\nTHG Beauty expected to deliver H2 revenue growth of +1.0% to +3.0% (H1 2025: -5.9%)\no\nTHG Nutrition expected to deliver H2 revenue growth of +10.0% to +12.0% (H1 2025: +3.1%)\nMatthew Moulding, CEO of THG, commented:\n\"I'm really pleased at how THG has gained momentum throughout the first half and into Q3. A slower start to the year in Beauty, alongside record whey prices in Nutrition, initially held back performance, but we saw clear improvement in Q2, in particular supported by Myprotein offline retail and licensing sales.\n\"As a business we've reaped the benefits of the recent extensive strategic initiatives across the Group, including the global rebranding of Myprotein throughout 2024. I'm especially pleased with the response to the new positioning of the Myprotein brand, reflected in the exciting breadth of partnerships we're delivering with other global brand owners and a return to new customer growth.\nOur Beauty business particularly in the UK demonstrated impressive resilience, securing market share gains in Q2, with a growing loyalty base and successful new brand launches supporting a return to revenue growth in Q3.\n\"Meanwhile the refinancing of our long-term debt, as well as the sale of Claremont Ingredients, significantly reduces the Group's net debt position whilst highlighting the value of some of the lesser known, smaller businesses in THG.\n\"I'd like to thank everybody in the business for their dedication and focus during this transformative period which sets us up well for our most profitable and cash generative period in H2.\nOur momentum is positive and Q3 will be our strongest trading period of the year so far, underpinning our confidence in the outlook.\"\nH1 2025 Group trading performance\n\u00a3m\nH1\n2025\nH1\n2024\nYoY\nGrowth\nContinuing\n[3]\nCCY\n[4]\nChange\nTHG Beauty\n479.9\n547.8\n-12.4%\n-5.9%\nTHG Nutrition\n303.6\n300.3\n+1.1%\n+3.1%\nTotal revenue\n783.4\n848.1\n-7.6%\n-2.6%\nTHG Beauty\n190.4\n223.4\n-14.8%\nTHG Nutrition\n131.8\n138.0\n-4.5%\nGross profit2\n322.2\n361.4\n-10.8%\nGross profit margin\n41.1%\n42.6%\n-150bps\nTHG Beauty\n20.2\n28.6\n-29.4%\nTHG Nutrition\n12.0\n19.6\n-38.8%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n[5]\n24.0\n37.1\n-35.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA %\n3.1%\n4.4%\n-130bps\nAdjusted items - cash\n1.7\n5.3\n-67.9%\nAdjusted items - non-cash\n3.7\n9.4\n-60.6%\nOperating loss\n(30.0)\n(30.7)\n-2.3%\nNet debt\n[6]\n(321.4)\n(350.5)\nAll comparative figures\nare continuing CCY unless otherwise stated,\nall\nnumbers and tables subject to rounding.

Following a highly competitive process, fast-growth international flavour specialists, Nactarome Group, majority owned by TA Associates, has agreed to acquire Claremont. This disposal marks a significant return on investment, with THG having acquired Claremont for \u00a352m\n[1]\nin late 2020.\nClaremont is a leading UK independent flavour manufacturing and development laboratory for sports nutrition, alongside specialisms in bakery and beverages. Claremont was acquired with the aim of accelerating Myprotein's ambitions in launching a global licensing range, in addition to new product development.\nFinancially, Claremont has delivered a significant return, through cash generation since acquisition plus disposal proceeds. Operationally, Claremont step-changed Myprotein's flavour capabilities and this key relationship will be protected through both a long-term supply contract and the broader, international capabilities of Nactarome Group.\nFinancial impact\n\u00b7\nThe cash disposal proceeds will contribute towards reducing net leverage and borrowing costs in line with THG's capital allocation strategy targeting a neutral net cash / net debt position.\n\u00b7\nClaremont's FY 2024 revenue was c.\u00a314m\n[2]\nwith limited seasonality. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA contribution was c.\u00a37m, with annual capex of less than \u00a31m.\n\u00b7\nGroup FY 2025 EBITDA and FY 2026 EBITDA are anticipated to be reduced by c.\u00a35m and c.\u00a310m respectively following the disposal.\nH1 2025 financial highlights\n\u00b7\nThe Group's interim results will be published in September 2025, with revenue performance in line with\nAGM statement guidance.\n\u00b7\nH1 2025 adjusted EBITDA of c.\u00a324m\n[3]\n(H1 2024: \u00a337.1m), primarily reflecting substantially higher whey pricing YoY in Nutrition.\nWhey commodity prices have remained stable at record highs during the last 12 months, with strong global demand matching new supply capacity, leading to market wide nutrition consumer price increases.\n\u00b7\nCash and available facilities of c.\u00a3278m\n[4]\n, following the Q1 2025 refinancing which substantially reduced gross debt.\n\u00b7\nNet debt of c.\u00a3330m (H1 2024: \u00a3350m), before net proceeds from the disposal of Claremont (proforma c.\u00a3230m). The second half of the year remains the seasonally strong cash generative period.\nStrategic update, H2 2025 and FY 2026\n\u00b7\nGiven whey price stability, rising nutrition consumer prices and Myprotein's structurally advantaged business model, THG Nutrition delivered double-digit revenue growth across June and July combined. Between +10% and +12% revenue growth is now expected in H2 for THG Nutrition.\n\u00b7\nWhilst H2 gross margins are in solid growth vs H1 2025, to prioritise long-term market share gains and customer loyalty, Myprotein will limit price increases in H2 2025, enabling further acceleration of its installed base in global offline retail from c.34,000 doors today, towards a target of 100,000.\n\u00b7\nThis opportunistic pricing approach is in line with prior discussions with shareholders and will underpin market share growth and operating leverage for the full financial year 2026.\n\u00b7\nThis customer-first strategic initiative will be supported by investment of approximately \u00a315m during 2025, and will result in a Group adjusted EBITDA of c.\u00a350m for H2. The financial impact of this investment strategy is limited to FY 2025, with FY 2026 solely adjusting for Claremont.\n\u00b7\nH2 has also started well for THG Beauty, with an improved revenue growth rate.\nMatthew Moulding, CEO of THG commented:\n\"Claremont has been a huge success, building Myprotein's global licensing franchise from a standing start to partnering with category leading brands in just a few years.\n\"After receiving a highly competitive offer, the timing was right to realise that value. The level of interest we received is a testament to the quality of the business.\n\"This disposal highlights the significant value embedded across THG's portfolio. My sincere thanks go to the entire Claremont team for their fantastic contribution and hard work.\n\"Finally, the decisions we are taking as a business to support our customers and grow Myprotein's market share aligns clearly with our wider strategy to streamline the Group and focus on our core strengths, whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nInvestor enquiries:\nKate Grimoldby, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Projects\nInvestor.Relations@thg.com\nMedia enquiries:\nSodali & Co - Financial PR adviser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7250 1446\nVicto",

The decision to withdraw from lower-margin Asia and European territories annualises in Q3, thereby neutralising the year-on-year revenue drag effect from that point onwards.\n\u00b7\nBeauty own brand revenue was held back in the quarter reflecting timing differences of key customer orders which are expected to reverse in H2.\nTHG Nutrition\n\u00b7\nPositive momentum within Nutrition continues to build, with new customer growth supporting a solid online performance. Q2 2025 revenue growth is expected to be between +5.0% and +7.0% (Q1 2025: +0.1%), with the business growing at its fastest rate since Q1 2022.\n\u00b7\nFrom a largely standing start 3 years ago, Nutrition's offline strategy is gaining significant traction. Myprotein products are now available in over 34,000 doors, principally within the UK, US and Japan. New retail listings secured in Europe in H1 2025 include 900 stores for the Dutch health and wellness specialist Kruidvat. Asia momentum continues to build with listings in 7-Eleven (>3,000 stores in Taiwan and Singapore), Costco (Taiwan) and Decathlon (Vietnam market entry through store-in-store model).\n\u00b7\nOffline expansion across the US has been particularly pleasing with an almost 5-fold increase in doors expected during the year to c.8,400 (2024: 1,500). Notable US wins include listings in Walmart, CVS and expansion into additional GNC stores.\n\u00b7\nMyprotein's move into both the offline and licensing space will see c.45 million units sold via these channels during 2025 through >40,000 global doors by the end of the year, enabling Myprotein to reach millions of new customers and further amplify brand awareness. The retail sales value of offline and licensed products is expected to be around \u00a3170m for FY 2025.\n\u00b7\nWhile both milk and whey prices continue to be elevated, there are some recent signs of softening, especially across the highest concentrations of protein.\nWhilst our direct exposure to tariffs is expected to be less than \u00a31.0m pre mitigating actions, we continue to monitor the changes to US trade policy and reciprocal actions for an adverse impact on raw material supply chains and US consumer sentiment.\nResults from the AGM will be published later today via RNS as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the meeting.\nFor further information please contact:\nInvestor enquiries:\nKate Grimoldby, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Projects\nInvestor.Relations@thg.com\nMedia enquiries:\nSodali & Co - Financial PR adviser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7250 1446\nVictoria Palmer-Moore/ Russ Lynch/ Sam Austrums/ Louisa Henry\nthg@sodali.com\nTHG PLC\nmedia-enquiries@thg.com\nENDS\nNotes to editors\nTHG PLC is a global e-commerce group headquartered in Manchester, UK, operating through two leading consumer businesses: THG Beauty and THG Nutrition.\nTHG Beauty operates prominent online platforms including Lookfantastic, Dermstore and Cult Beauty, offering a valued route to market for over 1,300 third-party brands, alongside a specialist portfolio of owned brands.\nTHG Nutrition, led by Myprotein, the world's largest online sports nutrition brand, spans multiple health and wellness categories, delivering its products both directly to consumers and through strategic offline partnerships worldwide.\n[1]\nCCY defined as constant currency basis\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Following on from the demerger, we immediately undertook the early refinancing of the Group's debt, reducing gearing and putting in place long-term facilities to the end of 2029, alongside entering the FTSE 250.\n\"We are now fully focused on THG Beauty and THG Nutrition, and I'm incredibly proud of the progress each business has made. Following extensive efficiency drives, incorporating both automation and AI, THG has become a much leaner, fitter Group that has shown strong resilience in the face of record whey commodity pricing that placed temporary pressure on Nutrition margins. A strong performance across our Beauty business, delivering ahead of its medium-term adjusted EBITDA margin target, helped the Group to deliver a pre-demerger adjusted EBITDA margin ahead of 2023 despite the transitory headwinds in Nutrition.\n\"Both our businesses have undertaken extensive model changes over the past 24 months. Beauty has focused on more profitable markets and building loyalty schemes, while Myprotein has pressed ahead in undertaking a successful rebrand, underpinning rapid growth across global offline retail and licensing.\n\"In the first quarter of this year, THG Beauty was up against a comparative period including an early Easter which is a key trading event, and an extra day's trading. However, in its home UK and US markets, Beauty retail is trading resiliently, with a strong selection of new brand launches planned throughout the year. It's also been especially pleasing to see Nutrition momentum improving throughout the quarter with February and March back in growth.\n\"With a capex light and efficient cost base, we are well positioned to return to sustainable growth and cash generation, whilst developing market share.\"\nFY 2024 Group trading performance\n\u00a3m\nFY\n2024\nFY\n2023\nYoY Growth\nCCY Change\nTHG Beauty\n1,108.5\n1,073.3\n+3.3%\n+4.6%\nTHG Nutrition\n579.8\n657.9\n-11.9%\n-8.7%\nPost-demerger revenue\n1,688.3\n1,731.2\n-2.5%\n-0.4%\nTHG Ingenuity (external)\n191.9\n165.5\n+16.0%\n+16.4%\nPre-demerger revenue\n1,880.2\n1,896.7\n-0.9%\n+1.1%\nDiscontinued categories revenue\n63.1\n148.6\n-57.5%\n-56.8%\nTotal revenue\n1,943.3\n2,045.4\n-5.0%\n-3.1%\nPost-demerger adjusted EBITDA\n[\n[4]\n]\n92.1\n111.3\n-17.2%\nPost-demerger adjusted EBITDA %\n5.5%\n6.4%\n-90bps\nAdjusted EBITDA - THG Ingenuity\n31.0\n11.0\n+182.4%\nPre-demerger adjusted EBITDA[\n[5]\n]\n123.1\n122.3\n+0.7%\nPre-demerger adjusted EBITDA %\n6.5%\n6.4%\n+10bps\nAdjusted EBITDA from discontinued categories\n(8.7)\n(8.2)\n-6.9%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n114.4\n114.1\n+0.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA %\n5.9%\n5.6%\n30bps\nAdjusted items - cash\n24.6\n10.4\n-136.5%\nAdjusted items - non-cash\n99.9\n21.2\n-371.2%\nOperating loss\n(147.9)\n(39.2)\n-277.3%\nNet debt\n(215.3)[\n[6]\n]\n(218.2)\nAll comparative figures\nare continuing CCY unless otherwise stated,\nall\nnumbers and tables subject to rounding.

The majority of the consideration offered was in the form of newly issued Selkirk shares, and the remainder of the consideration would have been payable in cash from a new equity and debt issuance, which was largely unfunded and without appropriate detail on its source.\nThe Board considered that the Proposal fundamentally undervalued Myprotein and its prospects, and in addition carried significant execution complexity and risks, in particular the ability of Selkirk to raise sufficient funding. On this basis, the Proposal was unequivocally rejected by the Board. THG confirms that there has been no further engagement with Selkirk since the Proposal was rejected.\nFollowing the Ingenuity demerger on 2 January 2025 and its recent successful refinancing, the company has reduced its gross and net debt, secured long-term banking facilities and is focused on executing its growth and cash generation strategy.\nThe Group's preliminary results and Q1 trading update are expected to be announced on or around 30 April 2025.\nFor further information please contact:\nInvestor enquiries - THG PLC\nKate Grimoldby, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Projects\nInvestor.relations@thg.com\nMedia enquiries:\nSodali & Co - Financial PR adviser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7100 6451\nVictoria Palmer-Moore/Russ Lynch/Maria Sizyakova\nthg@sodali.com\nTHG PLC\nmedia-enquiries@thg.com\nENDS\nNotes to Editors\nTHG PLC is a global e-commerce group headquartered in Manchester, UK, operating through two leading consumer businesses: THG Beauty and THG Nutrition.\nTHG Beauty operates prominent online platforms including Lookfantastic, Cult Beauty and Dermstore, offering a valued route to market for over 1,300 prestige third-party brands, alongside a specialist portfolio of owned brands.\nTHG Nutrition, led by Myprotein, the world's largest online sports nutrition brand, spans multiple health and wellness categories, delivering its products both directly to consumers and through strategic offline partnerships worldwide.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Matthew Moulding's investment in the Equity Contribution will be made personally or via FIC Shareco Limited.\nApplications have been made by the Company to the FCA for admission of the Placing Shares and the Conversion Shares to listing on the equity shares (commercial companies) category of the Official List maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority and to London Stock Exchange plc (\"\nLondon Stock Exchange\n\") for admission of the Placing Shares and the Conversion Shares to trading on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. It is expected that Admission will occur at 8:00 am on 27 March 2025 and that dealings in the Placing Shares and the Conversion Shares will commence at that time.\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the FCA (\"\nDTRs\n\"), the Company confirms that, following Admission, its issued share capital will comprise 1,431,443,364 Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.005 each, 56,082,651 D1 ordinary shares of \u00a30.005 each, 17,066 D2 ordinary shares of \u00a31.00 each, 48,571,808 E ordinary shares of \u00a30.005 each, 16,998,458 F ordinary shares of \u00a30.005 each, 9,107,559 G ordinary shares of \u00a30.005 each, 204,404,691 deferred 1 shares of \u00a30.005 each and 21,563,860 deferred 2 shares of \u00a30.005 each.

This represents another significant step in THG's simplified debt and equity investment case as a cash generative global retailer and brand owner, well positioned to deliver on its next phase of development in its growing consumer markets.\nThe proposed refinancing\ncomprises:\n\u00b7\na partial Amend & Extend (\"\nA&E\n\") of the existing EUR Term Loan B (\"\nTLB\n\") to extend the maturity of \u20ac475m to December 2029;\n\u00b7\nrepayment of the \u00a3109m existing GBP Term Loan A and the remaining \u20ac125m of the TLB through a combination of cash on balance sheet and a new equity contribution of at least \u00a360m and up to a maximum of \u00a391.2m (the \"\nEquity Contribution\n\"); and\n\u00b7\nextending the maturity of the existing \u00a3150m Revolving Credit Facility (\"\nRCF\n\") to May 2029 (collectively, the \"\nRefinancing\n\").\nAs a result of the proposed Refinancing, net total leverage (excl. leases) would decrease from 3.2x to 2.6x based on continuing Adjusted EBITDA\n[1]\n(excluding Ingenuity) of \u00a392m in 2024, on a fundamentally more cash generative business.\nTHG's founder and CEO, Matthew Moulding, has agreed to contribute, in aggregate, up to \u00a360m to the Equity Contribution. This forms another significant funding commitment by Matthew Moulding, having already invested \u00a350m in THG shares since IPO.\nUnder current authorisations, THG can issue up to c.91.86m shares for cash (equivalent to c\u00a331.2m at current market price).\nTherefore, the Equity Contribution will comprise a combination of:\n\u00b7\na cash issue by way of a proposed accelerated bookbuild placing (the \"\nABB\n\") and/or direct subscriptions with the Company (the \"\nSubscriptions\n\") of 91,855,591 new ordinary shares in the Company (the \"\nOrdinary Shares\n\"), representing approximately 6.95% of THG's existing issued share capital or equivalent to approximately \u00a331.2m based on the closing price of THG's shares on\n24 March 2025\n, (the ABB and the Subscriptions, together being the \"\nEquity Placing\n\") on the below terms:\no\nMatthew Moulding has agreed to subscribe for up to \u00a331.2m in the Equity Placing;\no\nthe Equity Placing will be made available to eligible shareholders and other long-term supporters of the Company and will allow, subject to investor demand and certain conditions, eligible shareholders and other long-term supporters to participate in the Equity Contribution; and\no\nto the extent any shares from the Equity Placing are allocated to institutional investors, Matthew Moulding's subscription will be scaled back;\n\u00b7\na further equity injection from Matthew Moulding, structured by way of a non-interest bearing convertible loan (the \"\nConvertible Loan\n\"), which will raise up to \u00a354.6m and may be scaled back by the Company based on demand from institutional investors in the Equity Placing; and\n\u00b7\nin addition, Matthew Moulding paying up partly paid shares totalling approximately \u00a35.35m.\nIn the event of scale back of Matthew Moulding's investment in the Equity Placing, his envisaged investment via the Convertible Loan is expected to increase (subject to a maximum amount of \u00a354.6m). At the discretion of the Company, the overall Equity Contribution can be upsized to allow investor participation. To the extent the Equity Contribution exceeds \u00a360m, the incremental proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.\nMatthew Moulding, is expected to subscribe for new shares (the \"Subscription Shares\"). The Subscription Shares will be subscribed for by Matthew Moulding pursuant to a subscription agreement (the \"Subscription Agreement\") entered into with the Company as part of the Subscription.

          "content": "See if we can hit a 41.92 or above close on either Thursday or Friday for bullish signs To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

The demerger itself has also simplified THG's structure, allowing it to focus on its core consumer brands and improving its financial profile. The collaboration with Google Cloud is expected to benefit THG RemainCo. This includes THG Beauty and THG Nutrition, through technology and operational improvements. The demerger has also simplified THG's structure, which allows it to focus on its consumer brands and improve its financial profile. Key benefits for THG RemainCo include: AI-Driven Personalisation: The integration of Google Cloud's AI and data analytics platforms (Vertex AI and Gemini models) is expected to enable personalized product recommendations and improve shopping experiences for consumers of brands like Lookfantastic and Myprotein. Enhanced Creative Production: THG Studios will use Google's Veo and Imagen AI models. This should help to generate visual assets more efficiently. It may also reduce operational costs and improve marketing. Improved Infrastructure & Scalability: The migration of THG Ingenuity's e-commerce and fulfillment infrastructure to Google Cloud will provide greater resilience, scalability, and security. This will directly support the operations of the beauty and nutrition divisions. Operational Efficiency: The partnership aims to drive efficiency across the commerce journey. This includes predictive demand planning and automated fulfillment solutions. This can help unlock new revenue streams and reduce operating costs for the consumer brands. Recent performance highlights: THG Beauty saw strong growth in the UK and Ireland. The Q4 2025 revenue increased by 16.2% (on a constant currency basis) for Lookfantastic. THG Nutrition had its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. This was driven by the strength of the Myprotein brand and expanded global offline retail distribution. Q4 2025 revenue was up 8.5% (on a constant currency basis). The group's overall strategy, including the demerger and focus on profitable growth, has led analysts to express greater confidence. Some have raised price targets and noted signs of improved performance.",

          "content": "@Baz excuse the ai, my calculator was struggling ... This application causes a dilution of approximately 2.476%, as 40,611,605 new shares are being issued into a total of 1,640,392,742 shares, increasing existing shareholders' stakes slightly less than before, primarily from Long Term Incentive Plan awards under the 2022 LTIP. Here's the calculation: New Shares Issued: 40,611,605. Total Shares After (New Denominator): 1,640,392,742. Dilution Percentage: (New Shares / Total Shares After) * 100. (40,611,605 / 1,640,392,742) * 100 = ~2.476%. Key Takeaways: Dilution: Existing shareholders' percentage ownership decreases slightly (by about 2.476%) because new shares are being added to the total. Purpose: These shares are for the company's 2022 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Impact: The new shares rank equally (pari passu) with existing ones, and the new total voting rights figure (1,640,392,742) serves as the new base for shareholders to track their ownership notifications, according to the {/LinkDisclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/PRO/issue-of-shares-to-ebt-and-total-voting-rights/17405938 }.",

Unless I am reading this wrong, it looks like a different solution is being found altogether: they are simply not using Ingenuity, instead THG has chosen Rockwell Automation's Plex Manufacturing Execution System to replace its legacy systems. I doubt such an angle is being factored into the stock, it being assumed they were simply tied into Ingenuity for some indefinite period of time, when instead it would appear they are able to change. THG's legacy systems must be using Ingenuity, if that is now changing at Warrington and later on across multiple global sites, then I doubt that has been understood by anyone / investors currently. Time, I think, to relook at how Ingenuity works with THG and understand better what can, and what cannot be changed. The shares are very materially undervalued if THG is able to do this.",

I find MM a chameleon who is less than transparent about motivation and the problem of conflict of interest between THG and Ingenuity is manifest. However, the frustration with lack of profitability compared with rivals masks  a few points. I think THG will rerate in time. 1 VAT issue - \u00a355m to \u00a360 back to THG. They absorbed all these add. costs whereas rivals didn't. Could this explain partially the profitability differential? 2 Asset sales - MM has dropped hints they might surprise the mkt. If an RNS drops of that nature, debt would be sign reduced. 3 i dont like MM the salesman approach whereby sales come at expense of profits but to be fair he cited AMAZON and the US approach as the model i.e. grow and develop the business until it becomes such a monster that it has considerable value. 4 I can see any number of global potential acquirers of MyProtein given protein is dominating offline sales trends...go in any supermarket -= there are more protein products than choc bars.... MM was very slow to recognise the importance of offline as a driver of brand recognition and value...hopeless....it was his team that got him into this and he was surprised to see the success....which doesnt suggest he gets out of the gym very often into the real world. However, the potential of offline is enormous and this will drive valuation multiples which could be multiples of that today by time they sell it.",

That is exactly what has happened to us shareholders here, and it is completely legal, that is the biggest joke of all. Whatever else, Moulding is clearly a financial mastermind, actually we don't stand a chance here as and until the Ingenuity contract is reformed / made more equal to THG. Still, as pointed out last night, it may be possible to form relationships with other companies to perform the roles that Ingenuity is currently undertaking for THG and this in turn could be much cheaper for THG. Current share price and rating assumes THG is on the worse footing regarding the Ingenuity contract. I suspect the rerating of the stock would be dramatic if that contract got amended. Once Ingenuity has a firm enough financial base I suspect the contract might get amended.",

If Ingenuity shares have tripled in value it\u2019s primarily down to remain co because as we know, the \u201cwhales\u201d were always promised but rarely if ever delivered.  Remain co is propping up Ingenuity and Moulding and his mates are doing very nicely from Ingenuity\u2019s success. That success may well be at the expense of remain co, through remain co over paying for services. APN is growing as is its share price.  Whey prices don\u2019t seem to bother it.  Yes it\u2019s not troubled by fluctuations in the Yen but even so, it is significantly outperforming THG because it makes a profit, so why doesn\u2019t THG?

Unless I am reading this wrong, it looks like a different solution is being found altogether: they are simply not using Ingenuity, instead THG has chosen Rockwell Automation's Plex Manufacturing Execution System to replace its legacy systems. I doubt such an angle is being factored into the stock, it being assumed they were simply tied into Ingenuity for some indefinite period of time, when instead it would appear they are able to change. THG's legacy systems must be using Ingenuity, if that is now changing at Warrington and later on across multiple global sites, then I doubt that has been understood by anyone / investors currently. Time, I think, to relook at how Ingenuity works with THG and understand better what can, and what cannot be changed. The shares are very materially undervalued if THG is able to do this.",

I find MM a chameleon who is less than transparent about motivation and the problem of conflict of interest between THG and Ingenuity is manifest. However, the frustration with lack of profitability compared with rivals masks  a few points. I think THG will rerate in time. 1 VAT issue - \u00a355m to \u00a360 back to THG. They absorbed all these add. costs whereas rivals didn't. Could this explain partially the profitability differential? 2 Asset sales - MM has dropped hints they might surprise the mkt. If an RNS drops of that nature, debt would be sign reduced. 3 i dont like MM the salesman approach whereby sales come at expense of profits but to be fair he cited AMAZON and the US approach as the model i.e. grow and develop the business until it becomes such a monster that it has considerable value. 4 I can see any number of global potential acquirers of MyProtein given protein is dominating offline sales trends...go in any supermarket -= there are more protein products than choc bars.... MM was very slow to recognise the importance of offline as a driver of brand recognition and value...hopeless....it was his team that got him into this and he was surprised to see the success....which doesnt suggest he gets out of the gym very often into the real world. However, the potential of offline is enormous and this will drive valuation multiples which could be multiples of that today by time they sell it.",

That is exactly what has happened to us shareholders here, and it is completely legal, that is the biggest joke of all. Whatever else, Moulding is clearly a financial mastermind, actually we don't stand a chance here as and until the Ingenuity contract is reformed / made more equal to THG. Still, as pointed out last night, it may be possible to form relationships with other companies to perform the roles that Ingenuity is currently undertaking for THG and this in turn could be much cheaper for THG. Current share price and rating assumes THG is on the worse footing regarding the Ingenuity contract. I suspect the rerating of the stock would be dramatic if that contract got amended. Once Ingenuity has a firm enough financial base I suspect the contract might get amended.",

To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

It seems to be quite a clever move for THG being (maybe) the only player to keep charging VAT.. because if the VAT refund comes, THG won't be under any obligation to refund the VAT to individual consumers under legislation it seems?.. Therefore the longer that VAT keeps being charged the more money in the pot for THG.. Seeing that MM thinks everyone else has stopped charging the VAT on the affected protein powders, there will obviously be some degree of short term price differential (although MY Protein is very competitively    priced according to MM), ultimately THG will recover more cash, this  assumes that  HMRC fail in their attempt to have the case overturned at a higher VAT tribunal?

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

How the World Cup (and major sports events) benefits THG/Myprotein: Increased Sales: Major tournaments boost global interest in fitness and nutrition, leading more people to buy protein supplements and related products for muscle recovery and performance. Market Expansion: Partnerships and increased visibility during big events help Myprotein reach wider audiences in new markets, says City AM. Brand Recognition: Being associated with elite sports elevates Myprotein's brand as a go-to for serious athletes and fitness fans. Product Innovation: Demand encourages development of new products, like their animal-free whey, catering to different dietary needs and sustainability concerns, notes Perfect Day. Myprotein's Role & Products: Quality & Differentiation: City AM notes Myprotein differentiates itself with quality, good pricing, and innovative products like protein pancakes and diet whey. Athlete Support: Products like Impact Whey provide essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for muscle repair and growth. Convenience: Products like protein pancake mixes and convenient shakes offer easy ways to meet protein goals. In essence, the global excitement around the World Cup fuels the health and wellness trend, directly benefiting companies like THG and its Myprotein brand by increasing demand for their high-quality, innovative protein solutions.",

I have both CFD and isa shares in this and would love nothing make than for it to be going up back to 80p fair value. By the guy is incompetent and lets us down every results. Will someone just buy this out on the cheap and do us all a favour.",

Pretty sure he is Dave and SRS, Sentiment rules, Sanks Sheila etc. think he hit burnt much worse from way before I was tinkering around with THG in the last 2 years. I bought in and caught thr wave up to 124 from the buy out rumours. It\u2019s then been up and down with some big downs since then. Luckily I managed to take breaks from THG when the big downs occurred after the rumours of buy out fizzled out. I guess Barry didn\u2019t hence he is even angrier and I don\u2019t blame him but he is a ncb jockey for his constant drivel in pirate speak.",

Stop Press: Sparsam said get your house on THG, the price is silly, now is defo the right time to buy Buy time 20 Jan 2026 12:09 This is silly now! Totally buying at this price. Everyone knew THG was discounting to bring up subscriptions, raise brand profile and such. So it is no surprise as far as I am concerned that EBITDA was maintained as forecast. The fact is they sold more, maybe got more subscriptions and brand awareness. More people sampling the brands and thus securing more growth which will help when they start to unwind the deals a little bit.",

The first CEO owe buildings and lend it to his company with price we never know .  then he separate  online platforms  into his private company and charge with super high compared  with market price but nobody can change it then what?  All of income and expensive  earned  from THG will  paid into his private companies  as he is landlord and he is client on his owe.  How can you set fair  price on that situation? CEO is big shareholder too so nobody can remove him  so what  do we do ? City they spot out  him from start and  that is why    its share price keep down event income and earning  look better  for  now.  The main point is how  finance  this company speding as they   use all that money from company  sending on  building  a hotel?  What why do THG need to run a hotel? Only option  to remore CEO  so this share will return its true value  or this state of company wil hang around  like this  or if some big  movement  challenge  CEO and remove  him so it worth to investment.",

THG IMHO will make profits and will eventually pay a dividend. That is why I am here, I am here for the long haul and will continue to buy when I can and post facts when I see them.  A lot of my posts get deleted, mostly the ones with factual links. Take from that what you will. This is one of the reasons why I don't post as often as I used to.  The very same posters who are ripping into MM now are the same posters who were screaming don't take up the allocation. Ingenuity is worthless.

THG Nutrition is multi-brand, DTC-led, global, returns-heavy, and marketing-intensive. They do not have the same cost structure \u2014 whey price is only one input. You can\u2019t isolate a margin gap and label it the Ingenuity tax. 2 Related-party payments are not theft \u2014 they\u2019re disclosed, audited, and priced under transfer-pricing rules The MSA was approved by the board, reviewed by auditors, and disclosed in full. If fees were inflated, auditors and regulators would not allow them. Related-party transactions,  value extraction \u2014 they exist in almost every demerged structure. 3 The tech wasn\u2019t given away, Ingenuity was moved so it could be valued, sold, or partnered independently. That\u2019s exactly what investors had been demanding for years. THG still has full contractual access \u2014 nothing was lost. 4 Debt staying with RemainCo is normal in demergers Debt follows cash-generating businesses (Nutrition & Beauty). That\u2019s standard corporate finance, not a dump. Bottom line: There is zero evidence of theft, only a standard demerger structure that the market may or may not like.  If this were a screw job, it would not have been signed off on by the auditors, regulators, banks, and major shareholders. Without actual proof, this is noise with an agenda. The share price is being manipulated of that there is no doubt. Everybody knows it.",

Look at the \"Average number of employees\" note. The Trend: You will likely see the headcount at THG Public drop significantly (as tech/warehouse staff moved to Ingenuity). The \"Screw Job\": Even though the staff are gone, the \"Distribution Costs\" line item on the Income Statement didn't drop by the same amount. Instead, the cost just changed names from \"Wages\" to \"Service Fees.\" You are paying the same (or more) for staff you no longer employ or control. Summary: The Single Chart to Look For If you only look at one thing, find the \"Segmental Adjusted EBITDA\" chart in the H1 2025 presentation. Visual Proof: You will see a bar for THG Nutrition that is tiny compared to 2 years ago. Ask yourself: \"Did people stop eating protein?\" No (see Applied Nutrition). \"Did the warehouse get more expensive?\" Yes.",

Here is your \"Do It Yourself\" Audit Kit to prove THG Public (You) is being drained by Ingenuity Private (Moulding). PROOF #1: The \"Same Ingredients, Different Profit\" Test The Document: THG Interim Results H1 2025 (Released Sept 2025) vs. Applied Nutrition FY25 Results (Released Nov 2025). The Test: Both companies buy the exact same raw material (Whey Protein). Both sell to the same customers. Go to THG\u2019s H1 2025 Report: Look for the Segmental Breakdown table. Find: THG Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it collapsed to ~3.9%. (Management blamed \"high whey prices\"). Go to Applied Nutrition\u2019s FY25 Report: Look for the Financial Highlights page. Find: EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it sits at ~30%. The Conclusion: If \"high whey prices\" were the real problem, Applied Nutrition would have crashed too. They didn't. The ~26% difference is almost entirely the \"Ingenuity Tax\"\u2014the inflated fees THG Nutrition is forced to pay for warehousing and tech. PROOF #2: The \"Related Party\" Leak The Document: THG Demerger Circular (Published Nov 2024) or the H1 2025 Financial Statements. The Test: Find the money leaving the building. Go to the \"Related Party Transactions\" Note: This is usually Note 18 or similar in the back of the accounts. Find: \"Amounts payable to THG Ingenuity.\" The Number: In 2024/2025, this figure runs into the hundreds of millions. The \"Kick in the Teeth\": Look for the \"Master Services Agreement (MSA)\" terms in the Demerger Circular. It explicitly states the contract is for 10 years. This proves you are legally locked into paying these fees until ~2035, regardless of whether you make a profit. PROOF #3: The \"Debt Dump\" The Document: THG H1 2025 Balance Sheet. The Test: Who kept the mortgage, and who got the house? Look at \"Net Debt\": You will see THG Public (RemainCo) holds roughly \u00a3321 million in net debt. Look at \"Intangible Assets\": You will see a massive drop because the proprietary technology (the \"Ingenuity Platform\" IP) was transferred to the Private Company. The Conclusion: The Public Company kept the debt (the burden) but gave away the tech assets (the potential growth). You are now paying rent to use the technology you used to own, while still paying off the bank loans used to build it.",

Look, as you would expect, since we\u2019ve announced the sale of Claremont, there\u2019s obviously a lot of interest in the background as to some of our other manufacturing assets in particular and the performances of that. It would be fair to say we\u2019ve had formal approaches on some of those assets. We\u2019re pretty clear as to how we stand on these things, which is the private market valuations, as we saw with Claremont, are robust. If we receive interest in an asset where we believe we can make a deal work for us without in any way negatively impacting the existing business models of either nutrition or beauty, then sure, we will entertain that and know and derive a fair valuation for one of those assets, especially if it\u2019s of a material value. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s like with Claremont, it was \u00a3100 million plus consideration, then sure, we would do that, especially given the valuations that are on, you know, of THG and the wider PLC market today. I think that\u2019s probably as deep as I should go into that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty frank and open to say, look, we could quite readily put an RNS out at any point to say we\u2019ve done a transaction. It would be something that\u2019s relatively non-core at a fair market value that delivers something that we\u2019re pretty pleased with. How long will that be before we do that? Who knows? It will depend on achieving the right price points, if those prices arrive. That\u2019s probably as much as I can say right now.",

          "content": "Am with John Gould on how undervalued THG is; let's not forget what he said a few months ago Coke has a market cap of \u00a3211bn and small net debt with \u00a335bn of sales giving an EV/Sales of 6.6x. Coke backed Monster ten years ago with a $2bn investment for a 17% holding. That $2bn represented less than 1% of Coke\u2019s value. Monster has revenues of \u00a35.6bn, a market cap of \u00a348.1bn with small debt giving an EV/Sales of 8.6x. Monster\u2019s share price is up 40x over 20 years. Coke\u2019s $2bn investment is now worth around $8bn, driven by Monster\u2019s push through Coke\u2019s distribution network. Celsius, the US-listed health drink, offers a similar story. Pepsi is an 11% shareholder and global distribution partner. Pepsi bought into Celsius in 2022 and in August 2025 with another $500m. Pepsi has invested over $1bn for its 11% stake which is less than 1% of its mkt cap. Celsius\u2019s mkt cap is \u00a311.1bn with revenue of \u00a31.0bn last year being an 11x sales multiple. Its share price is up c.30x in just five years. Lotus Bakeries, the Dutch-listed food business behind Lotus Biscoff, shows that you don\u2019t need to be Coke-sized to achieve strong valuations. Its health division includes Trek and Nak\u2019d bars, both acquired over the past five years. Lotus has a mkt cap of \u00a35.7bn with small debt with \u00a31.1bn revenue in 2024 and trades on an EV/Sales of 5.4x. Fevertree, a UK stock partnered with Molson in January 2025 which invested \u00a370m for an 8.5% stake (around 1% of Molson\u2019s mkt cap). Fevertree has sales of \u00a3360m last year and a mkt cap of \u00a31bn, giving EV/Sales of 2.7x. Molson has the capability to significantly accelerate Fevertree\u2019s growth. As for THG, its mkt cap is \u00a3540m with \u00a3200m net debt, giving an EV of \u00a3740m. Total sales post-demerger last year were \u00a31.7bn, of which \u00a3580m came from THG Nutrition (MyProtein) and the balance from THG Beauty. If we split value 50/50, MyProtein trades on c. 0.6x sales. MyProtein appears to be on the radar screen of several global brands such as Muller and the new unnamed global confectioner who appear to want to work with them on product development.",

Naturally, confidentiality agreements between parties would prevent any disclosure of such terms. What would Holland & Barret say, by comparison, if they found out THG Beauty and THG Nutrition were receiving a 30% discount on their fulfilment services? MM has publicly said he has been holding prices. Couple this with the Whey and Yen headwinds, and of course, this will affect profits!! This is all in the public domain.

To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

          "content": "This will be great for THG The World Cup is great for THG (The Hut Group) and Myprotein through increased sales from global sports nutrition demand, driving revenue, brand awareness, and new market entry, especially with partnerships like Hyrox and Mars, showing consumers prioritize wellness, while Myprotein leverages quality and innovation, like animal-free whey, to meet this demand for effective protein supplements for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. How the World Cup (and major sports events) benefits THG/Myprotein: Increased Sales: Major tournaments boost global interest in fitness and nutrition, leading more people to buy protein supplements and related products for muscle recovery and performance. Market Expansion: Partnerships and increased visibility during big events help Myprotein reach wider audiences in new markets, says City AM. Brand Recognition: Being associated with elite sports elevates Myprotein's brand as a go-to for serious athletes and fitness fans. Product Innovation: Demand encourages development of new products, like their animal-free whey, catering to different dietary needs and sustainability concerns, notes Perfect Day. Myprotein's Role & Products: Quality & Differentiation: City AM notes Myprotein differentiates itself with quality, good pricing, and innovative products like protein pancakes and diet whey. Athlete Support: Products like Impact Whey provide essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for muscle repair and growth. Convenience: Products like protein pancake mixes and convenient shakes offer easy ways to meet protein goals. In essence, the global excitement around the World Cup fuels the health and wellness trend, directly benefiting companies like THG and its Myprotein brand by increasing demand for their high-quality, innovative protein solutions.",

Flash crash downwards. Positive sentiment turns to FUD. But lets recall; Positive media after and of 3 Brokers. One Broker upgraded quickly after (Jefferies) from 55p to 60p. Another maintained 80p guidance and Lastly JPM Cazenove reiterated a Target Price of 55p. No Sell recommendations. 22 Jan 26. Extra Bonus shares listed and admitted - 40,611,605 Many querying why these were awarded, after the the poor share price performance. No real share price reaction initially - but then it falls in the days after. Possible seller? 29th Jan 26. Linkedin post by Matt Moulding. Highlighting the current state of the UK market and querying when things will be addressed. Share price falls on the day and has fallen further today. Honest Injun - No rush of buyers either at just over 37p So much so that this is the case. THG Revenue.  \u00a31.716 BILLION. Market Capitalisation: \u00a3579.49M Applied Nutrition (APN) Revenue. \u00a3107.1 MILLION Market Capitalisation: \u00a3582.5M But one, THG is generating  X 17 the revenue of APN. Significantly so. Virtually 6X also that on Nutrition. Sum of Parts of THG also far in excess. Yet they are actually valued less than APN. Then just to put things in perspective THG is actually being valued at less than the top end of the \u00a3400M to \u00a3600M speculative preliminary conditional offer that Selkirk Group made for THG Nutrition alone.  Meaning THG Beauty a \u00a31.1 Billion Revenue generator consisting of multiple businesses and Brands is effectively valued for FREE. https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SELK/response-to-statement-by-thg-plc-e3rw7vvgabgzb48.html Not wishing to be impertinent but yes you can blame the market but seriously any company you would expect also to look inward and to have a full scrum down, thorough review, dissection and implement improvement measures if necessary. For instance: Do we need to have Analyst meetings tagged to Trading updates when others don't bother. RNS Content the same - taking lessons out of others RNS with favourable reaction. Best practice. Might less be more. (See BOO, See APN and countless others). Participants if we do - do all contribute, are they media trained or media competent? Are these Linkedin postings actually benefiting group shareholders? Virtually every time these are posted then the share price goes down. Also why no Investor Relations engagement with shareholders. Might this not help resolve issues, FUD and misinformation. Then perhaps the biggest question. Is the share price ever going to recover to meaningful value and get out of this constancy of rise and fall with the present CEO, BoD, Strategy? Does it need a reshuffling or refreshing? My thoughts only. Enjoy your weekends.",

And if it does I cannot see the reason why the SP should not reach \u00a31+. I have been a holder of CURRYs for a very long time because I was always in red. but held it until last year and sold out.

That, and no doubt helped along the way by those setting the price and those who benefit from churning volume, for incredibly the market price setting must have this now about Absolute Parity with APN in terms of Market Cap. The difference last night was only a mere \u00a320 million. Absolutely astonishing really that both have similar market caps, when one (THG) generates \u00a31.7Billion of Revenue against the others (APN) only just over \u00a3100 Million of Revenue, a difference of a Factor 17 - and THG has a Beauty division completely distinct from Nutrition and generating about \u00a31.1 Billion revenues. Yes one might have Profit and the other not,  but then again one also has \u00a355million sat in a pending  VAT refund, and the other probably hasn't. Just read the Linkedin post from last night and sorry to say it, but it's not how to win friends and influence people. That said  are you just meant to sit silent and watch whilst you're share price gets car crashed back and forward so some hedge fund or funds make \u00a3100's of millions through manipulation and by devaluing your share prices, - when the actual update actually read quite well. And was now over 2 weeks ago (13th Jan). Rightfully imo he does ask When? is something actually going to be done about this, as it's detrimental to the London Stock Exchange and AIM, with net withdrawals and no new listings. Maybe from a shareholder perspective, and years of this, you have to ask if this is being  targeted due to one or more Individuals at the top and actually in the longer term interests of shareholders is it not time to be looking at making some changes. Shame really for it was actually starting to look and trade like a FTSE 250 company, with a relatively stable share price and tight'ish range. Never moan though at the price that's presented to you. Might go cheaper still, might go higher. Staged entry always the better strategy imvho. Each decides their own respective strategy. Just my take on things.",

Stop Press: Sparsam said get your house on THG, the price is silly, now is defo the right time to buy Buy time 20 Jan 2026 12:09 This is silly now! Totally buying at this price. Everyone knew THG was discounting to bring up subscriptions, raise brand profile and such. So it is no surprise as far as I am concerned that EBITDA was maintained as forecast. The fact is they sold more, maybe got more subscriptions and brand awareness. More people sampling the brands and thus securing more growth which will help when they start to unwind the deals a little bit.",

I bet many must juts sell straight away and maybe that is Matt\u2019s plan. He knows his staff can see the SP keep dropping so they will sell as soon as shares land. He probably counts on that as means to drive the share price lower.  Rinse repeat and keep the company out of profit until he can miraculously rescue it and take private.",

THG IMHO will make profits and will eventually pay a dividend. That is why I am here, I am here for the long haul and will continue to buy when I can and post facts when I see them.  A lot of my posts get deleted, mostly the ones with factual links. Take from that what you will. This is one of the reasons why I don't post as often as I used to.  The very same posters who are ripping into MM now are the same posters who were screaming don't take up the allocation. Ingenuity is worthless.

THG Nutrition is multi-brand, DTC-led, global, returns-heavy, and marketing-intensive. They do not have the same cost structure \u2014 whey price is only one input. You can\u2019t isolate a margin gap and label it the Ingenuity tax. 2 Related-party payments are not theft \u2014 they\u2019re disclosed, audited, and priced under transfer-pricing rules The MSA was approved by the board, reviewed by auditors, and disclosed in full. If fees were inflated, auditors and regulators would not allow them. Related-party transactions,  value extraction \u2014 they exist in almost every demerged structure. 3 The tech wasn\u2019t given away, Ingenuity was moved so it could be valued, sold, or partnered independently. That\u2019s exactly what investors had been demanding for years. THG still has full contractual access \u2014 nothing was lost. 4 Debt staying with RemainCo is normal in demergers Debt follows cash-generating businesses (Nutrition & Beauty). That\u2019s standard corporate finance, not a dump. Bottom line: There is zero evidence of theft, only a standard demerger structure that the market may or may not like.  If this were a screw job, it would not have been signed off on by the auditors, regulators, banks, and major shareholders. Without actual proof, this is noise with an agenda. The share price is being manipulated of that there is no doubt. Everybody knows it.",

Look at the \"Average number of employees\" note. The Trend: You will likely see the headcount at THG Public drop significantly (as tech/warehouse staff moved to Ingenuity). The \"Screw Job\": Even though the staff are gone, the \"Distribution Costs\" line item on the Income Statement didn't drop by the same amount. Instead, the cost just changed names from \"Wages\" to \"Service Fees.\" You are paying the same (or more) for staff you no longer employ or control. Summary: The Single Chart to Look For If you only look at one thing, find the \"Segmental Adjusted EBITDA\" chart in the H1 2025 presentation. Visual Proof: You will see a bar for THG Nutrition that is tiny compared to 2 years ago. Ask yourself: \"Did people stop eating protein?\" No (see Applied Nutrition). \"Did the warehouse get more expensive?\" Yes.",

Here is your \"Do It Yourself\" Audit Kit to prove THG Public (You) is being drained by Ingenuity Private (Moulding). PROOF #1: The \"Same Ingredients, Different Profit\" Test The Document: THG Interim Results H1 2025 (Released Sept 2025) vs. Applied Nutrition FY25 Results (Released Nov 2025). The Test: Both companies buy the exact same raw material (Whey Protein). Both sell to the same customers. Go to THG\u2019s H1 2025 Report: Look for the Segmental Breakdown table. Find: THG Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it collapsed to ~3.9%. (Management blamed \"high whey prices\"). Go to Applied Nutrition\u2019s FY25 Report: Look for the Financial Highlights page. Find: EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it sits at ~30%. The Conclusion: If \"high whey prices\" were the real problem, Applied Nutrition would have crashed too. They didn't. The ~26% difference is almost entirely the \"Ingenuity Tax\"\u2014the inflated fees THG Nutrition is forced to pay for warehousing and tech. PROOF #2: The \"Related Party\" Leak The Document: THG Demerger Circular (Published Nov 2024) or the H1 2025 Financial Statements. The Test: Find the money leaving the building. Go to the \"Related Party Transactions\" Note: This is usually Note 18 or similar in the back of the accounts. Find: \"Amounts payable to THG Ingenuity.\" The Number: In 2024/2025, this figure runs into the hundreds of millions. The \"Kick in the Teeth\": Look for the \"Master Services Agreement (MSA)\" terms in the Demerger Circular. It explicitly states the contract is for 10 years. This proves you are legally locked into paying these fees until ~2035, regardless of whether you make a profit. PROOF #3: The \"Debt Dump\" The Document: THG H1 2025 Balance Sheet. The Test: Who kept the mortgage, and who got the house? Look at \"Net Debt\": You will see THG Public (RemainCo) holds roughly \u00a3321 million in net debt. Look at \"Intangible Assets\": You will see a massive drop because the proprietary technology (the \"Ingenuity Platform\" IP) was transferred to the Private Company. The Conclusion: The Public Company kept the debt (the burden) but gave away the tech assets (the potential growth). You are now paying rent to use the technology you used to own, while still paying off the bank loans used to build it.",

Look, as you would expect, since we\u2019ve announced the sale of Claremont, there\u2019s obviously a lot of interest in the background as to some of our other manufacturing assets in particular and the performances of that. It would be fair to say we\u2019ve had formal approaches on some of those assets. We\u2019re pretty clear as to how we stand on these things, which is the private market valuations, as we saw with Claremont, are robust. If we receive interest in an asset where we believe we can make a deal work for us without in any way negatively impacting the existing business models of either nutrition or beauty, then sure, we will entertain that and know and derive a fair valuation for one of those assets, especially if it\u2019s of a material value. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s like with Claremont, it was \u00a3100 million plus consideration, then sure, we would do that, especially given the valuations that are on, you know, of THG and the wider PLC market today. I think that\u2019s probably as deep as I should go into that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty frank and open to say, look, we could quite readily put an RNS out at any point to say we\u2019ve done a transaction. It would be something that\u2019s relatively non-core at a fair market value that delivers something that we\u2019re pretty pleased with. How long will that be before we do that? Who knows? It will depend on achieving the right price points, if those prices arrive. That\u2019s probably as much as I can say right now.",

Coke backed Monster ten years ago with a $2bn investment for a 17% holding. That $2bn represented less than 1% of Coke\u2019s value. Monster has revenues of \u00a35.6bn, a market cap of \u00a348.1bn with small debt giving an EV/Sales of 8.6x. Monster\u2019s share price is up 40x over 20 years. Coke\u2019s $2bn investment is now worth around $8bn, driven by Monster\u2019s push through Coke\u2019s distribution network. Celsius, the US-listed health drink, offers a similar story. Pepsi is an 11% shareholder and global distribution partner. Pepsi bought into Celsius in 2022 and in August 2025 with another $500m. Pepsi has invested over $1bn for its 11% stake which is less than 1% of its mkt cap. Celsius\u2019s mkt cap is \u00a311.1bn with revenue of \u00a31.0bn last year being an 11x sales multiple. Its share price is up c.30x in just five years. Lotus Bakeries, the Dutch-listed food business behind Lotus Biscoff, shows that you don\u2019t need to be Coke-sized to achieve strong valuations. Its health division includes Trek and Nak\u2019d bars, both acquired over the past five years. Lotus has a mkt cap of \u00a35.7bn with small debt with \u00a31.1bn revenue in 2024 and trades on an EV/Sales of 5.4x. Fevertree, a UK stock partnered with Molson in January 2025 which invested \u00a370m for an 8.5% stake (around 1% of Molson\u2019s mkt cap). Fevertree has sales of \u00a3360m last year and a mkt cap of \u00a31bn, giving EV/Sales of 2.7x. Molson has the capability to significantly accelerate Fevertree\u2019s growth. As for THG, its mkt cap is \u00a3540m with \u00a3200m net debt, giving an EV of \u00a3740m. Total sales post-demerger last year were \u00a31.7bn, of which \u00a3580m came from THG Nutrition (MyProtein) and the balance from THG Beauty. If we split value 50/50, MyProtein trades on c. 0.6x sales.

Naturally, confidentiality agreements between parties would prevent any disclosure of such terms. What would Holland & Barret say, by comparison, if they found out THG Beauty and THG Nutrition were receiving a 30% discount on their fulfilment services? MM has publicly said he has been holding prices. Couple this with the Whey and Yen headwinds, and of course, this will affect profits!! This is all in the public domain.

To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

How the World Cup (and major sports events) benefits THG/Myprotein: Increased Sales: Major tournaments boost global interest in fitness and nutrition, leading more people to buy protein supplements and related products for muscle recovery and performance. Market Expansion: Partnerships and increased visibility during big events help Myprotein reach wider audiences in new markets, says City AM. Brand Recognition: Being associated with elite sports elevates Myprotein's brand as a go-to for serious athletes and fitness fans. Product Innovation: Demand encourages development of new products, like their animal-free whey, catering to different dietary needs and sustainability concerns, notes Perfect Day. Myprotein's Role & Products: Quality & Differentiation: City AM notes Myprotein differentiates itself with quality, good pricing, and innovative products like protein pancakes and diet whey. Athlete Support: Products like Impact Whey provide essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for muscle repair and growth. Convenience: Products like protein pancake mixes and convenient shakes offer easy ways to meet protein goals. In essence, the global excitement around the World Cup fuels the health and wellness trend, directly benefiting companies like THG and its Myprotein brand by increasing demand for their high-quality, innovative protein solutions.",

Says everyone can go in (can\u2019t) but the share price will increase due to shares removed into ingenuity Then proceeds to stick more back on through his 60 mil plus 40 mil for bonuses (never known I bonus paid for no profit). So there are more shares than before and a third less of the business. That my colleagues is painful in any explanation. Let\u2019s hope that Matt is getting tired of the city foot on his head and allows him to boot the chairman and take his place. No matter how it is spinned, we need fresh management blood, performance based target on profitability. I do believe ingenuity is sapping the life out of THG, why would others use it. I believe he took as much of it out before demerger and is betting on market share to support growth then profit. Would the supermarkets be willing to pay extra and they still have the counter space??? Hence everything just hinge on whey reduction for now.",

At that time, the deal was at roughly 1.8\u00d7 forward revenue and added significant US beauty sales to THG\u2019s portfolio. Given that Dermstore has probably grown its revenue and profit since it was purchased, a buyer is likely to pay a higher valuation multiple than what Target did, especially if Dermstore is now more profitable or has stronger market positioning. Link to strong market positioning: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wearethg_wearethg-activity-7422688274114072576-uv3b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADGjivYBi98_Kr0ghVvJn-kmg4bPEKZKahI Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples (depending on growth/EBITDA), often in the 1.5\u00d7\u20133\u00d7 revenue range if earnings are robust and predictable. If they did sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. And here is the crazy thing, if it sold at the upper end of \u00a3500M then that is not that far from the current MC",

Flash crash downwards. Positive sentiment turns to FUD. But lets recall; Positive media after and of 3 Brokers. One Broker upgraded quickly after (Jefferies) from 55p to 60p. Another maintained 80p guidance and Lastly JPM Cazenove reiterated a Target Price of 55p. No Sell recommendations. 22 Jan 26. Extra Bonus shares listed and admitted - 40,611,605 Many querying why these were awarded, after the the poor share price performance. No real share price reaction initially - but then it falls in the days after. Possible seller? 29th Jan 26. Linkedin post by Matt Moulding. Highlighting the current state of the UK market and querying when things will be addressed. Share price falls on the day and has fallen further today. Honest Injun - No rush of buyers either at just over 37p So much so that this is the case. THG Revenue.  \u00a31.716 BILLION. Market Capitalisation: \u00a3579.49M Applied Nutrition (APN) Revenue. \u00a3107.1 MILLION Market Capitalisation: \u00a3582.5M But one, THG is generating  X 17 the revenue of APN. Significantly so. Virtually 6X also that on Nutrition. Sum of Parts of THG also far in excess. Yet they are actually valued less than APN. Then just to put things in perspective THG is actually being valued at less than the top end of the \u00a3400M to \u00a3600M speculative preliminary conditional offer that Selkirk Group made for THG Nutrition alone.  Meaning THG Beauty a \u00a31.1 Billion Revenue generator consisting of multiple businesses and Brands is effectively valued for FREE. https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SELK/response-to-statement-by-thg-plc-e3rw7vvgabgzb48.html Not wishing to be impertinent but yes you can blame the market but seriously any company you would expect also to look inward and to have a full scrum down, thorough review, dissection and implement improvement measures if necessary. For instance: Do we need to have Analyst meetings tagged to Trading updates when others don't bother. RNS Content the same - taking lessons out of others RNS with favourable reaction. Best practice. Might less be more. (See BOO, See APN and countless others). Participants if we do - do all contribute, are they media trained or media competent? Are these Linkedin postings actually benefiting group shareholders? Virtually every time these are posted then the share price goes down. Also why no Investor Relations engagement with shareholders. Might this not help resolve issues, FUD and misinformation. Then perhaps the biggest question. Is the share price ever going to recover to meaningful value and get out of this constancy of rise and fall with the present CEO, BoD, Strategy? Does it need a reshuffling or refreshing?

Name me one other CEO of a ftse company that conducts himself like Moulding and because he has the vast wealth from IPO can acts in his own interests first. To him it's his company not a company that he works for and making decisions that are in the best interest of other THG shareholders doesn't seem his priority.. I'm so fed up with this stock and Moulding but unfortunately keep holding on for years now thinking this is going to turn and I'll recover my big losses.  I hope it does for all of us..",

However since than I have been adding around 40p few days ago and today at38p. It is just so frustrating that it just keep going down. I don't know why but I think I will just keep adding if it keeps dropping. My belief is also that if there is nothing sinister at the background that we don't know about this company should be able to deliver a decent profit. And if it does I cannot see the reason why the SP should not reach \u00a31+. I have been a holder of CURRYs for a very long time because I was always in red. but held it until last year and sold out. Company has tripled its SP in less than three years. GLA",

That, and no doubt helped along the way by those setting the price and those who benefit from churning volume, for incredibly the market price setting must have this now about Absolute Parity with APN in terms of Market Cap. The difference last night was only a mere \u00a320 million. Absolutely astonishing really that both have similar market caps, when one (THG) generates \u00a31.7Billion of Revenue against the others (APN) only just over \u00a3100 Million of Revenue, a difference of a Factor 17 - and THG has a Beauty division completely distinct from Nutrition and generating about \u00a31.1 Billion revenues. Yes one might have Profit and the other not,  but then again one also has \u00a355million sat in a pending  VAT refund, and the other probably hasn't. Just read the Linkedin post from last night and sorry to say it, but it's not how to win friends and influence people. That said  are you just meant to sit silent and watch whilst you're share price gets car crashed back and forward so some hedge fund or funds make \u00a3100's of millions through manipulation and by devaluing your share prices, - when the actual update actually read quite well. And was now over 2 weeks ago (13th Jan). Rightfully imo he does ask When? is something actually going to be done about this, as it's detrimental to the London Stock Exchange and AIM, with net withdrawals and no new listings. Maybe from a shareholder perspective, and years of this, you have to ask if this is being  targeted due to one or more Individuals at the top and actually in the longer term interests of shareholders is it not time to be looking at making some changes. Shame really for it was actually starting to look and trade like a FTSE 250 company, with a relatively stable share price and tight'ish range. Never moan though at the price that's presented to you. Might go cheaper still, might go higher. Staged entry always the better strategy imvho. Each decides their own respective strategy. Just my take on things.",

Everyone knew THG was discounting to bring up subscriptions, raise brand profile and such. So it is no surprise as far as I am concerned that EBITDA was maintained as forecast. The fact is they sold more, maybe got more subscriptions and brand awareness. More people sampling the brands and thus securing more growth which will help when they start to unwind the deals a little bit.",

I mean the globalist world we live happily allows this to occur. And rather than pay out hard cash to staff he can easy dilute shareholders every year with no cost to him. I bet many must juts sell straight away and maybe that is Matt\u2019s plan. He knows his staff can see the SP keep dropping so they will sell as soon as shares land. He probably counts on that as means to drive the share price lower.  Rinse repeat and keep the company out of profit until he can miraculously rescue it and take private.",

I don't take advice from these boards, and I did take up my allocation of Ingenuity shares. I also get replies from IR for what it is worth. THG IMHO will make profits and will eventually pay a dividend. That is why I am here, I am here for the long haul and will continue to buy when I can and post facts when I see them.  A lot of my posts get deleted, mostly the ones with factual links. Take from that what you will. This is one of the reasons why I don't post as often as I used to.  The very same posters who are ripping into MM now are the same posters who were screaming don't take up the allocation. Ingenuity is worthless. How wrong they were on that one, and how wrong they will be in the very near future about THG's profitability. Good Luck, One All TTFN  :)",

I'm not asking for anyone to short this, or sell their shares or for a riot to start between us. All I'm asking is ask more, demand more. Ask more of MM, and IR team. Demand more proof, insights. Lets stick up for what we worth as together we have a lot of share percentage so lets unite in stopping any shadiness, preventing more of it and lets stick together and demand more light on stuff. That can only be a good thing right. This is still undervalued that is a certainty, but it could also be taken away from us at an even greater loss. Lets try to prevent that and lets try to get what is ours. GL to us all, all the best guys, truly mean it",

THG Nutrition is multi-brand, DTC-led, global, returns-heavy, and marketing-intensive. They do not have the same cost structure \u2014 whey price is only one input. You can\u2019t isolate a margin gap and label it the Ingenuity tax. 2 Related-party payments are not theft \u2014 they\u2019re disclosed, audited, and priced under transfer-pricing rules The MSA was approved by the board, reviewed by auditors, and disclosed in full. If fees were inflated, auditors and regulators would not allow them. Related-party transactions,  value extraction \u2014 they exist in almost every demerged structure. 3 The tech wasn\u2019t given away, Ingenuity was moved so it could be valued, sold, or partnered independently. That\u2019s exactly what investors had been demanding for years. THG still has full contractual access \u2014 nothing was lost. 4 Debt staying with RemainCo is normal in demergers Debt follows cash-generating businesses (Nutrition & Beauty). That\u2019s standard corporate finance, not a dump. Bottom line: There is zero evidence of theft, only a standard demerger structure that the market may or may not like.  If this were a screw job, it would not have been signed off on by the auditors, regulators, banks, and major shareholders. Without actual proof, this is noise with an agenda. The share price is being manipulated of that there is no doubt. Everybody knows it.",

          "content": "PROOF #4: The \"Headcount\" Shuffle The Document: THG Annual Report (Strategic Report Section - People). The Test: Are you paying for ghost workers? Look at the \"Average number of employees\" note. The Trend: You will likely see the headcount at THG Public drop significantly (as tech/warehouse staff moved to Ingenuity). The \"Screw Job\": Even though the staff are gone, the \"Distribution Costs\" line item on the Income Statement didn't drop by the same amount. Instead, the cost just changed names from \"Wages\" to \"Service Fees.\" You are paying the same (or more) for staff you no longer employ or control. Summary: The Single Chart to Look For If you only look at one thing, find the \"Segmental Adjusted EBITDA\" chart in the H1 2025 presentation. Visual Proof: You will see a bar for THG Nutrition that is tiny compared to 2 years ago. Ask yourself: \"Did people stop eating protein?\" No (see Applied Nutrition). \"Did the warehouse get more expensive?\" Yes.",

          "content": "You don't have to trust me, and you don't have to trust Matthew Moulding. You can see the \"screw job\" yourself by looking at three specific public documents. Here is your \"Do It Yourself\" Audit Kit to prove THG Public (You) is being drained by Ingenuity Private (Moulding). PROOF #1: The \"Same Ingredients, Different Profit\" Test The Document: THG Interim Results H1 2025 (Released Sept 2025) vs. Applied Nutrition FY25 Results (Released Nov 2025). The Test: Both companies buy the exact same raw material (Whey Protein). Both sell to the same customers. Go to THG\u2019s H1 2025 Report: Look for the Segmental Breakdown table. Find: THG Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it collapsed to ~3.9%. (Management blamed \"high whey prices\"). Go to Applied Nutrition\u2019s FY25 Report: Look for the Financial Highlights page. Find: EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it sits at ~30%. The Conclusion: If \"high whey prices\" were the real problem, Applied Nutrition would have crashed too. They didn't. The ~26% difference is almost entirely the \"Ingenuity Tax\"\u2014the inflated fees THG Nutrition is forced to pay for warehousing and tech. PROOF #2: The \"Related Party\" Leak The Document: THG Demerger Circular (Published Nov 2024) or the H1 2025 Financial Statements. The Test: Find the money leaving the building. Go to the \"Related Party Transactions\" Note: This is usually Note 18 or similar in the back of the accounts. Find: \"Amounts payable to THG Ingenuity.\" The Number: In 2024/2025, this figure runs into the hundreds of millions. The \"Kick in the Teeth\": Look for the \"Master Services Agreement (MSA)\" terms in the Demerger Circular. It explicitly states the contract is for 10 years. This proves you are legally locked into paying these fees until ~2035, regardless of whether you make a profit. PROOF #3: The \"Debt Dump\" The Document: THG H1 2025 Balance Sheet. The Test: Who kept the mortgage, and who got the house? Look at \"Net Debt\": You will see THG Public (RemainCo) holds roughly \u00a3321 million in net debt. Look at \"Intangible Assets\": You will see a massive drop because the proprietary technology (the \"Ingenuity Platform\" IP) was transferred to the Private Company. The Conclusion: The Public Company kept the debt (the burden) but gave away the tech assets (the potential growth). You are now paying rent to use the technology you used to own, while still paying off the bank loans used to build it.",

Look, as you would expect, since we\u2019ve announced the sale of Claremont, there\u2019s obviously a lot of interest in the background as to some of our other manufacturing assets in particular and the performances of that. It would be fair to say we\u2019ve had formal approaches on some of those assets. We\u2019re pretty clear as to how we stand on these things, which is the private market valuations, as we saw with Claremont, are robust. If we receive interest in an asset where we believe we can make a deal work for us without in any way negatively impacting the existing business models of either nutrition or beauty, then sure, we will entertain that and know and derive a fair valuation for one of those assets, especially if it\u2019s of a material value. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s like with Claremont, it was \u00a3100 million plus consideration, then sure, we would do that, especially given the valuations that are on, you know, of THG and the wider PLC market today. I think that\u2019s probably as deep as I should go into that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty frank and open to say, look, we could quite readily put an RNS out at any point to say we\u2019ve done a transaction. It would be something that\u2019s relatively non-core at a fair market value that delivers something that we\u2019re pretty pleased with. How long will that be before we do that? Who knows? It will depend on achieving the right price points, if those prices arrive. That\u2019s probably as much as I can say right now.",

          "content": "Am with John Gould on how undervalued THG is; let's not forget what he said a few months ago Coke has a market cap of \u00a3211bn and small net debt with \u00a335bn of sales giving an EV/Sales of 6.6x. Coke backed Monster ten years ago with a $2bn investment for a 17% holding. That $2bn represented less than 1% of Coke\u2019s value. Monster has revenues of \u00a35.6bn, a market cap of \u00a348.1bn with small debt giving an EV/Sales of 8.6x. Monster\u2019s share price is up 40x over 20 years. Coke\u2019s $2bn investment is now worth around $8bn, driven by Monster\u2019s push through Coke\u2019s distribution network. Celsius, the US-listed health drink, offers a similar story. Pepsi is an 11% shareholder and global distribution partner. Pepsi bought into Celsius in 2022 and in August 2025 with another $500m. Pepsi has invested over $1bn for its 11% stake which is less than 1% of its mkt cap. Celsius\u2019s mkt cap is \u00a311.1bn with revenue of \u00a31.0bn last year being an 11x sales multiple. Its share price is up c.30x in just five years. Lotus Bakeries, the Dutch-listed food business behind Lotus Biscoff, shows that you don\u2019t need to be Coke-sized to achieve strong valuations. Its health division includes Trek and Nak\u2019d bars, both acquired over the past five years. Lotus has a mkt cap of \u00a35.7bn with small debt with \u00a31.1bn revenue in 2024 and trades on an EV/Sales of 5.4x. Fevertree, a UK stock partnered with Molson in January 2025 which invested \u00a370m for an 8.5% stake (around 1% of Molson\u2019s mkt cap). Fevertree has sales of \u00a3360m last year and a mkt cap of \u00a31bn, giving EV/Sales of 2.7x. Molson has the capability to significantly accelerate Fevertree\u2019s growth. As for THG, its mkt cap is \u00a3540m with \u00a3200m net debt, giving an EV of \u00a3740m. Total sales post-demerger last year were \u00a31.7bn, of which \u00a3580m came from THG Nutrition (MyProtein) and the balance from THG Beauty. If we split value 50/50, MyProtein trades on c. 0.6x sales. MyProtein appears to be on the radar screen of several global brands such as Muller and the new unnamed global confectioner who appear to want to work with them on product development.",

To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

It seems to be quite a clever move for THG being (maybe) the only player to keep charging VAT.. because if the VAT refund comes, THG won't be under any obligation to refund the VAT to individual consumers under legislation it seems?.. Therefore the longer that VAT keeps being charged the more money in the pot for THG.. Seeing that MM thinks everyone else has stopped charging the VAT on the affected protein powders, there will obviously be some degree of short term price differential (although MY Protein is very competitively    priced according to MM), ultimately THG will recover more cash, this  assumes that  HMRC fail in their attempt to have the case overturned at a higher VAT tribunal?

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

How the World Cup (and major sports events) benefits THG/Myprotein: Increased Sales: Major tournaments boost global interest in fitness and nutrition, leading more people to buy protein supplements and related products for muscle recovery and performance. Market Expansion: Partnerships and increased visibility during big events help Myprotein reach wider audiences in new markets, says City AM. Brand Recognition: Being associated with elite sports elevates Myprotein's brand as a go-to for serious athletes and fitness fans. Product Innovation: Demand encourages development of new products, like their animal-free whey, catering to different dietary needs and sustainability concerns, notes Perfect Day. Myprotein's Role & Products: Quality & Differentiation: City AM notes Myprotein differentiates itself with quality, good pricing, and innovative products like protein pancakes and diet whey. Athlete Support: Products like Impact Whey provide essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for muscle repair and growth. Convenience: Products like protein pancake mixes and convenient shakes offer easy ways to meet protein goals. In essence, the global excitement around the World Cup fuels the health and wellness trend, directly benefiting companies like THG and its Myprotein brand by increasing demand for their high-quality, innovative protein solutions.",

Now I think we\u2019re on our third month of 2 million Myprotein units. Into retail in a month for three consecutive months. I know it\u2019s certainly two. I\u2019m expecting the third month when I see the data to come through with the same as well. The sellout is a bit different, but obviously we\u2019re interested in the selling just as much,were 2 million units just in protein. Yogurts under the M\u00fcller partnership. That gives you an idea of the extent of the touch points that we have in that. If you were to look at Iceland as a retailer, we\u2019re probably doing in the region of about \u00a370 million a year of frozen meals with Iceland across two different types of ranges that we have with them. Now the average meal is somewhere in the region of about \u00a33.50. I think given all the average product, there are some cheaper products than that they sell. You get an idea there. There\u2019s, you know, \u00a320 million of products probably going out the door just in frozen foods and that\u2019s pretty much limited to Iceland. There are some other distribution points, but it\u2019s very successful for them. They do control distribution of that and they do have an exclusive on that range of products in there.",

          "content": "Positive feedback on the partnership 1. A powerful strategic fit Greencore Group plc is one of the UK\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s largest convenience food producers \u2014 supplying sandwiches, wraps, ready meals and other chilled products. It\u2019s also the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. So partnering with them gives Myprotein instant credibility and best-in-class manufacturing, distribution and category expertise. For Greencore, working with the UK\u2019s biggest sports nutrition brand positions them at the heart of the high-growth, high-protein convenience market rather than just traditional sandwiches. 2. Major retail validation Launching in 500+ Sainsbury\u2019s stores and inside the meal deal space is a huge achievement. Meal deals drive some of the highest footfall and repeat purchase in UK grocery \u2014 this puts Myprotein in front of millions of mainstream consumers, not just gym enthusiasts. 3. Category expansion done the right way Moving from powders and supplements into fresh, ready-to-eat food is a bold step. Doing it via Greencore shows a smart, asset-light strategy: leverage an expert partner instead of building complex chilled manufacturing in-house. 4. Products that match consumer trends Up to 28g protein, <376 calories, strong flavours like Firecracker and Teriyaki \u2014 this hits exactly what shoppers want: Healthier Convenience, High protein,Great taste with no \u201cdiet food\u201d compromise Perfect for the growing audience of hybrid workers and time-poor consumers. 5. Growth runway for both sides The post confirms this is just phase one, with broader UK distribution planned later in the year. That gives Greencore: incremental volumes,higher-value branded production, deeper relationship with THG/Myprotein And gives Myprotein a bridge from online dominance into offline everyday consumption.. Well done, THG this is a great deal",

Don't ever play poker as you 'tell' is sooooo obvious :) THG Beauty Revenue = \u00a31.1bn Warpaint Revenue = \u00a3105M THG Revenue is 10 times more than Warpaint Yet Beauty's market cap estimate of \u00a3300M is less than double Warpaint's market cap of \u00a3177M In its arsenal, THG Beauty has a company called Dermstore. Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples, often in the 1.5x - 3x revenue range. If THG decided to sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. That is more than double the MC of Warpaint at its lower end valuation. Cmon Matty, sell another asset, and let's all go to the pub :)",

          "content": "Stan, you\u2019re trying to compare two businesses that are structured in completely different ways. APN is a focused retailer with a narrow product set, whereas THG is an integrated global platform that is home to 2 powerhouses: Beauty & Nutrition. Lumping all of THG\u2019s \u00a31.7bn revenue against APN\u2019s \u00a3105m and expecting the same margin profile simply isn\u2019t a like-for-like comparison. Over \u00a31.1bn of THG revenue comes from Beauty, a category with very different margin dynamics to protein powders, and nothing to do with whey input costs. THG also owns assets APN doesn\u2019t. Capex has already fallen sharply post-demerger and net debt is down materially, which shows the model is moving in the right direction. APN making \u00a330m on \u00a3105m sales is great, but it operates a far simpler model with far less infrastructure. THG is building a global brand and that inevitably distorts short-term P&L versus a pure retailer. As cash flow turns positive in 2026, the operating leverage will start to show. An audit wouldn\u2019t magically strip out \u00a3150m \u2013 most of those costs support owned assets and capabilities APN simply doesn\u2019t have. Compare the right segments on a like-for-like basis and the picture looks very different. And guess what -  MyProtein in its infancy was making \u00a330M on \u00a3100M revenue Lastly, what happened to 'It's not THG's fault, it's the fault of the Hedge Funds' we had 100s of those posts from you last year - have you flipped :) Stanleyb Posted in: THG Posts: 3,836 Fines, fines, fines...28 Oct 2025 10:24 Fines, fines, fines..!!!

That's what I'm in for as I believe they can do it whilst still growing revenue. If margins don't grow then the SP belongs in the gutter and APN belongs higher as their margins are awesome.",

Says everyone can go in (can\u2019t) but the share price will increase due to shares removed into ingenuity Then proceeds to stick more back on through his 60 mil plus 40 mil for bonuses (never known I bonus paid for no profit). So there are more shares than before and a third less of the business. That my colleagues is painful in any explanation. Let\u2019s hope that Matt is getting tired of the city foot on his head and allows him to boot the chairman and take his place. No matter how it is spinned, we need fresh management blood, performance based target on profitability. I do believe ingenuity is sapping the life out of THG, why would others use it. I believe he took as much of it out before demerger and is betting on market share to support growth then profit. Would the supermarkets be willing to pay extra and they still have the counter space??? Hence everything just hinge on whey reduction for now.",

At that time, the deal was at roughly 1.8\u00d7 forward revenue and added significant US beauty sales to THG\u2019s portfolio. Given that Dermstore has probably grown its revenue and profit since it was purchased, a buyer is likely to pay a higher valuation multiple than what Target did, especially if Dermstore is now more profitable or has stronger market positioning. Link to strong market positioning: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wearethg_wearethg-activity-7422688274114072576-uv3b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADGjivYBi98_Kr0ghVvJn-kmg4bPEKZKahI Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples (depending on growth/EBITDA), often in the 1.5\u00d7\u20133\u00d7 revenue range if earnings are robust and predictable. If they did sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. And here is the crazy thing, if it sold at the upper end of \u00a3500M then that is not that far from the current MC",

Flash crash downwards. Positive sentiment turns to FUD. But lets recall; Positive media after and of 3 Brokers. One Broker upgraded quickly after (Jefferies) from 55p to 60p. Another maintained 80p guidance and Lastly JPM Cazenove reiterated a Target Price of 55p. No Sell recommendations. 22 Jan 26. Extra Bonus shares listed and admitted - 40,611,605 Many querying why these were awarded, after the the poor share price performance. No real share price reaction initially - but then it falls in the days after. Possible seller? 29th Jan 26. Linkedin post by Matt Moulding. Highlighting the current state of the UK market and querying when things will be addressed. Share price falls on the day and has fallen further today. Honest Injun - No rush of buyers either at just over 37p So much so that this is the case. THG Revenue.  \u00a31.716 BILLION. Market Capitalisation: \u00a3579.49M Applied Nutrition (APN) Revenue. \u00a3107.1 MILLION Market Capitalisation: \u00a3582.5M But one, THG is generating  X 17 the revenue of APN. Significantly so. Virtually 6X also that on Nutrition. Sum of Parts of THG also far in excess. Yet they are actually valued less than APN. Then just to put things in perspective THG is actually being valued at less than the top end of the \u00a3400M to \u00a3600M speculative preliminary conditional offer that Selkirk Group made for THG Nutrition alone.  Meaning THG Beauty a \u00a31.1 Billion Revenue generator consisting of multiple businesses and Brands is effectively valued for FREE. https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SELK/response-to-statement-by-thg-plc-e3rw7vvgabgzb48.html Not wishing to be impertinent but yes you can blame the market but seriously any company you would expect also to look inward and to have a full scrum down, thorough review, dissection and implement improvement measures if necessary. For instance: Do we need to have Analyst meetings tagged to Trading updates when others don't bother. RNS Content the same - taking lessons out of others RNS with favourable reaction. Best practice. Might less be more. (See BOO, See APN and countless others). Participants if we do - do all contribute, are they media trained or media competent? Are these Linkedin postings actually benefiting group shareholders? Virtually every time these are posted then the share price goes down. Also why no Investor Relations engagement with shareholders. Might this not help resolve issues, FUD and misinformation. Then perhaps the biggest question. Is the share price ever going to recover to meaningful value and get out of this constancy of rise and fall with the present CEO, BoD, Strategy? Does it need a reshuffling or refreshing? My thoughts only. Enjoy your weekends.",

To him it's his company not a company that he works for and making decisions that are in the best interest of other THG shareholders doesn't seem his priority..

However since than I have been adding around 40p few days ago and today at38p. It is just so frustrating that it just keep going down. I don't know why but I think I will just keep adding if it keeps dropping. My belief is also that if there is nothing sinister at the background that we don't know about this company should be able to deliver a decent profit. And if it does I cannot see the reason why the SP should not reach \u00a31+. I have been a holder of CURRYs for a very long time because I was always in red. but held it until last year and sold out. Company has tripled its SP in less than three years. GLA",

That, and no doubt helped along the way by those setting the price and those who benefit from churning volume, for incredibly the market price setting must have this now about Absolute Parity with APN in terms of Market Cap. The difference last night was only a mere \u00a320 million. Absolutely astonishing really that both have similar market caps, when one (THG) generates \u00a31.7Billion of Revenue against the others (APN) only just over \u00a3100 Million of Revenue, a difference of a Factor 17 - and THG has a Beauty division completely distinct from Nutrition and generating about \u00a31.1 Billion revenues. Yes one might have Profit and the other not,  but then again one also has \u00a355million sat in a pending  VAT refund, and the other probably hasn't. Just read the Linkedin post from last night and sorry to say it, but it's not how to win friends and influence people. That said  are you just meant to sit silent and watch whilst you're share price gets car crashed back and forward so some hedge fund or funds make \u00a3100's of millions through manipulation and by devaluing your share prices, - when the actual update actually read quite well. And was now over 2 weeks ago (13th Jan). Rightfully imo he does ask When? is something actually going to be done about this, as it's detrimental to the London Stock Exchange and AIM, with net withdrawals and no new listings. Maybe from a shareholder perspective, and years of this, you have to ask if this is being  targeted due to one or more Individuals at the top and actually in the longer term interests of shareholders is it not time to be looking at making some changes. Shame really for it was actually starting to look and trade like a FTSE 250 company, with a relatively stable share price and tight'ish range. Never moan though at the price that's presented to you. Might go cheaper still, might go higher. Staged entry always the better strategy imvho. Each decides their own respective strategy. Just my take on things.",

Everyone knew THG was discounting to bring up subscriptions, raise brand profile and such. So it is no surprise as far as I am concerned that EBITDA was maintained as forecast. The fact is they sold more, maybe got more subscriptions and brand awareness. More people sampling the brands and thus securing more growth which will help when they start to unwind the deals a little bit.",

I mean the globalist world we live happily allows this to occur. And rather than pay out hard cash to staff he can easy dilute shareholders every year with no cost to him. I bet many must juts sell straight away and maybe that is Matt\u2019s plan. He knows his staff can see the SP keep dropping so they will sell as soon as shares land. He probably counts on that as means to drive the share price lower.  Rinse repeat and keep the company out of profit until he can miraculously rescue it and take private.",

THG IMHO will make profits and will eventually pay a dividend. That is why I am here, I am here for the long haul and will continue to buy when I can and post facts when I see them.  A lot of my posts get deleted, mostly the ones with factual links. Take from that what you will. This is one of the reasons why I don't post as often as I used to.  The very same posters who are ripping into MM now are the same posters who were screaming don't take up the allocation. Ingenuity is worthless. How wrong they were on that one, and how wrong they will be in the very near future about THG's profitability. Good Luck, One All TTFN  :)",

I'm not asking for anyone to short this, or sell their shares or for a riot to start between us. All I'm asking is ask more, demand more. Ask more of MM, and IR team. Demand more proof, insights. Lets stick up for what we worth as together we have a lot of share percentage so lets unite in stopping any shadiness, preventing more of it and lets stick together and demand more light on stuff. That can only be a good thing right. This is still undervalued that is a certainty, but it could also be taken away from us at an even greater loss.

THG Nutrition is multi-brand, DTC-led, global, returns-heavy, and marketing-intensive. They do not have the same cost structure \u2014 whey price is only one input. You can\u2019t isolate a margin gap and label it the Ingenuity tax. 2 Related-party payments are not theft \u2014 they\u2019re disclosed, audited, and priced under transfer-pricing rules The MSA was approved by the board, reviewed by auditors, and disclosed in full. If fees were inflated, auditors and regulators would not allow them. Related-party transactions,  value extraction \u2014 they exist in almost every demerged structure. 3 The tech wasn\u2019t given away, Ingenuity was moved so it could be valued, sold, or partnered independently. That\u2019s exactly what investors had been demanding for years. THG still has full contractual access \u2014 nothing was lost. 4 Debt staying with RemainCo is normal in demergers Debt follows cash-generating businesses (Nutrition & Beauty). That\u2019s standard corporate finance, not a dump. Bottom line: There is zero evidence of theft, only a standard demerger structure that the market may or may not like.  If this were a screw job, it would not have been signed off on by the auditors, regulators, banks, and major shareholders. Without actual proof, this is noise with an agenda. The share price is being manipulated of that there is no doubt. Everybody knows it.",

Look at the \"Average number of employees\" note. The Trend: You will likely see the headcount at THG Public drop significantly (as tech/warehouse staff moved to Ingenuity). The \"Screw Job\": Even though the staff are gone, the \"Distribution Costs\" line item on the Income Statement didn't drop by the same amount. Instead, the cost just changed names from \"Wages\" to \"Service Fees.\" You are paying the same (or more) for staff you no longer employ or control. Summary: The Single Chart to Look For If you only look at one thing, find the \"Segmental Adjusted EBITDA\" chart in the H1 2025 presentation. Visual Proof: You will see a bar for THG Nutrition that is tiny compared to 2 years ago. Ask yourself: \"Did people stop eating protein?\" No (see Applied Nutrition). \"Did the warehouse get more expensive?\" Yes.",

Here is your \"Do It Yourself\" Audit Kit to prove THG Public (You) is being drained by Ingenuity Private (Moulding). PROOF #1: The \"Same Ingredients, Different Profit\" Test The Document: THG Interim Results H1 2025 (Released Sept 2025) vs. Applied Nutrition FY25 Results (Released Nov 2025). The Test: Both companies buy the exact same raw material (Whey Protein). Both sell to the same customers. Go to THG\u2019s H1 2025 Report: Look for the Segmental Breakdown table. Find: THG Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it collapsed to ~3.9%. (Management blamed \"high whey prices\"). Go to Applied Nutrition\u2019s FY25 Report: Look for the Financial Highlights page. Find: EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it sits at ~30%. The Conclusion: If \"high whey prices\" were the real problem, Applied Nutrition would have crashed too. They didn't. The ~26% difference is almost entirely the \"Ingenuity Tax\"\u2014the inflated fees THG Nutrition is forced to pay for warehousing and tech. PROOF #2: The \"Related Party\" Leak The Document: THG Demerger Circular (Published Nov 2024) or the H1 2025 Financial Statements. The Test: Find the money leaving the building. Go to the \"Related Party Transactions\" Note: This is usually Note 18 or similar in the back of the accounts. Find: \"Amounts payable to THG Ingenuity.\" The Number: In 2024/2025, this figure runs into the hundreds of millions. The \"Kick in the Teeth\": Look for the \"Master Services Agreement (MSA)\" terms in the Demerger Circular. It explicitly states the contract is for 10 years. This proves you are legally locked into paying these fees until ~2035, regardless of whether you make a profit. PROOF #3: The \"Debt Dump\" The Document: THG H1 2025 Balance Sheet. The Test: Who kept the mortgage, and who got the house? Look at \"Net Debt\": You will see THG Public (RemainCo) holds roughly \u00a3321 million in net debt. Look at \"Intangible Assets\": You will see a massive drop because the proprietary technology (the \"Ingenuity Platform\" IP) was transferred to the Private Company. The Conclusion: The Public Company kept the debt (the burden) but gave away the tech assets (the potential growth). You are now paying rent to use the technology you used to own, while still paying off the bank loans used to build it.",

Look, as you would expect, since we\u2019ve announced the sale of Claremont, there\u2019s obviously a lot of interest in the background as to some of our other manufacturing assets in particular and the performances of that. It would be fair to say we\u2019ve had formal approaches on some of those assets. We\u2019re pretty clear as to how we stand on these things, which is the private market valuations, as we saw with Claremont, are robust. If we receive interest in an asset where we believe we can make a deal work for us without in any way negatively impacting the existing business models of either nutrition or beauty, then sure, we will entertain that and know and derive a fair valuation for one of those assets, especially if it\u2019s of a material value. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s like with Claremont, it was \u00a3100 million plus consideration, then sure, we would do that, especially given the valuations that are on, you know, of THG and the wider PLC market today. I think that\u2019s probably as deep as I should go into that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty frank and open to say, look, we could quite readily put an RNS out at any point to say we\u2019ve done a transaction. It would be something that\u2019s relatively non-core at a fair market value that delivers something that we\u2019re pretty pleased with. How long will that be before we do that? Who knows? It will depend on achieving the right price points, if those prices arrive. That\u2019s probably as much as I can say right now.",

Coke backed Monster ten years ago with a $2bn investment for a 17% holding. That $2bn represented less than 1% of Coke\u2019s value. Monster has revenues of \u00a35.6bn, a market cap of \u00a348.1bn with small debt giving an EV/Sales of 8.6x. Monster\u2019s share price is up 40x over 20 years. Coke\u2019s $2bn investment is now worth around $8bn, driven by Monster\u2019s push through Coke\u2019s distribution network. Celsius, the US-listed health drink, offers a similar story. Pepsi is an 11% shareholder and global distribution partner. Pepsi bought into Celsius in 2022 and in August 2025 with another $500m. Pepsi has invested over $1bn for its 11% stake which is less than 1% of its mkt cap. Celsius\u2019s mkt cap is \u00a311.1bn with revenue of \u00a31.0bn last year being an 11x sales multiple. Its share price is up c.30x in just five years. Lotus Bakeries, the Dutch-listed food business behind Lotus Biscoff, shows that you don\u2019t need to be Coke-sized to achieve strong valuations. Its health division includes Trek and Nak\u2019d bars, both acquired over the past five years. Lotus has a mkt cap of \u00a35.7bn with small debt with \u00a31.1bn revenue in 2024 and trades on an EV/Sales of 5.4x. Fevertree, a UK stock partnered with Molson in January 2025 which invested \u00a370m for an 8.5% stake (around 1% of Molson\u2019s mkt cap). Fevertree has sales of \u00a3360m last year and a mkt cap of \u00a31bn, giving EV/Sales of 2.7x. Molson has the capability to significantly accelerate Fevertree\u2019s growth. As for THG, its mkt cap is \u00a3540m with \u00a3200m net debt, giving an EV of \u00a3740m. Total sales post-demerger last year were \u00a31.7bn, of which \u00a3580m came from THG Nutrition (MyProtein) and the balance from THG Beauty. If we split value 50/50, MyProtein trades on c. 0.6x sales. MyProtein appears to be on the radar screen of several global brands such as Muller and the new unnamed global confectioner who appear to want to work with them on product development.",

To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

It seems to be quite a clever move for THG being (maybe) the only player to keep charging VAT.. because if the VAT refund comes, THG won't be under any obligation to refund the VAT to individual consumers under legislation it seems?.. Therefore the longer that VAT keeps being charged the more money in the pot for THG.. Seeing that MM thinks everyone else has stopped charging the VAT on the affected protein powders, there will obviously be some degree of short term price differential (although MY Protein is very competitively    priced according to MM), ultimately THG will recover more cash, this  assumes that  HMRC fail in their attempt to have the case overturned at a higher VAT tribunal?

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

How the World Cup (and major sports events) benefits THG/Myprotein: Increased Sales: Major tournaments boost global interest in fitness and nutrition, leading more people to buy protein supplements and related products for muscle recovery and performance. Market Expansion: Partnerships and increased visibility during big events help Myprotein reach wider audiences in new markets, says City AM. Brand Recognition: Being associated with elite sports elevates Myprotein's brand as a go-to for serious athletes and fitness fans. Product Innovation: Demand encourages development of new products, like their animal-free whey, catering to different dietary needs and sustainability concerns, notes Perfect Day. Myprotein's Role & Products: Quality & Differentiation: City AM notes Myprotein differentiates itself with quality, good pricing, and innovative products like protein pancakes and diet whey. Athlete Support: Products like Impact Whey provide essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for muscle repair and growth. Convenience: Products like protein pancake mixes and convenient shakes offer easy ways to meet protein goals. In essence, the global excitement around the World Cup fuels the health and wellness trend, directly benefiting companies like THG and its Myprotein brand by increasing demand for their high-quality, innovative protein solutions.",

JAO \ud83d\ude33 \ud83d\ude33 Here is why a THG (Myprotein) x Greggs partnership would\u2014theoretically\u2014be a brilliant financial move for both: \u200b1. The \"Health-Halo\" for Greggs \u200bGreggs is currently desperate to prove it isn't just a \"sausage roll peddler.\" \u200bThe Problem: Their \"Balanced Choice\" range has been around for years, but it lacks \"street cred\" with the fitness crowd. \u200bThe Solution: A Myprotein-branded \"Power Meal Deal\" at Greggs would give them instant authority. Imagine a \"Myprotein x Greggs\" Chicken & Pesto Pasta or a high-protein breakfast pot. It would turn a \"guilty pleasure\" destination into a legitimate choice for the 14% of UK consumers currently trying to increase protein intake. \u200b2. Physical Footprint for THG \u200bTHG has roughly 2,700 \"doors\" via its recent Sainsbury\u2019s/Greencore deal. \u200bThe Scale: Greggs has over 2,740 shops and is aiming for 3,000. \u200bThe Advantage: A Greggs partnership would effectively double Myprotein\u2019s physical presence overnight. More importantly, it puts Myprotein in high-footfall \"grab-and-go\" locations (train stations, high streets, and petrol stations) where people are looking for a quick, healthy alternative to a pasty. \u200b3. Fighting the \"GLP-1\" Decline \u200bGreggs' CEO, Roisin Currie, admitted in late 2025 that appetite-suppressing drugs are a \"market headwind.\" \u200bPeople on these medications eat less, but when they do eat, they prioritize nutrient density (protein/fibre) to avoid muscle loss. \u200bBy partnering with Myprotein, Greggs could capture the \"reduced-appetite\" spender who is currently walking past their store to go to an M&S Foodhall or a Joe & The Juice. \u200bIs it actually likely? \u200bWhile it makes financial sense, there are two major hurdles: \u200bThe Brand Conflict: Greggs has spent 10 years building its own \"Balanced Choice\" brand. Admitting they need Myprotein's help might be seen as a sign of weakness by their own marketing team. \u200bThe Greencore Exclusive: It\u2019s possible that THG\u2019s new deal with Greencore (who also supplies many of the UK's top retailers) might have \"exclusivity clauses\" that prevent Myprotein from doing a direct manufacturing deal with a competitor like Greggs for a set period. \u200bSummary: The \"Bull Case\" for the Share Price \u200bIf Matt Moulding announced a Greggs x Myprotein partnership, the share price would almost certainly re-test that 51p level or higher. It would be seen as the ultimate \"mainstreaming\" of the brand. JAO ADYOR!",

Product is out there. How much, I think, look, to give you a small fact on that, the M\u00fcller as an example had the selling to retailers in M\u00fcller. Now I think we\u2019re on our third month of 2 million Myprotein units. Into retail in a month for three consecutive months. I know it\u2019s certainly two. I\u2019m expecting the third month when I see the data to come through with the same as well. The sellout is a bit different, but obviously we\u2019re interested in the selling just as much,were 2 million units just in protein. Yogurts under the M\u00fcller partnership. That gives you an idea of the extent of the touch points that we have in that. If you were to look at Iceland as a retailer, we\u2019re probably doing in the region of about \u00a370 million a year of frozen meals with Iceland across two different types of ranges that we have with them. Now the average meal is somewhere in the region of about \u00a33.50. I think given all the average product, there are some cheaper products than that they sell. You get an idea there. There\u2019s, you know, \u00a320 million of products probably going out the door just in frozen foods and that\u2019s pretty much limited to Iceland. There are some other distribution points, but it\u2019s very successful for them. They do control distribution of that and they do have an exclusive on that range of products in there.",

          "content": "Positive feedback on the partnership 1. A powerful strategic fit Greencore Group plc is one of the UK\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s largest convenience food producers \u2014 supplying sandwiches, wraps, ready meals and other chilled products. It\u2019s also the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. So partnering with them gives Myprotein instant credibility and best-in-class manufacturing, distribution and category expertise. For Greencore, working with the UK\u2019s biggest sports nutrition brand positions them at the heart of the high-growth, high-protein convenience market rather than just traditional sandwiches. 2. Major retail validation Launching in 500+ Sainsbury\u2019s stores and inside the meal deal space is a huge achievement. Meal deals drive some of the highest footfall and repeat purchase in UK grocery \u2014 this puts Myprotein in front of millions of mainstream consumers, not just gym enthusiasts. 3. Category expansion done the right way Moving from powders and supplements into fresh, ready-to-eat food is a bold step. Doing it via Greencore shows a smart, asset-light strategy: leverage an expert partner instead of building complex chilled manufacturing in-house. 4. Products that match consumer trends Up to 28g protein, <376 calories, strong flavours like Firecracker and Teriyaki \u2014 this hits exactly what shoppers want: Healthier Convenience, High protein,Great taste with no \u201cdiet food\u201d compromise Perfect for the growing audience of hybrid workers and time-poor consumers. 5. Growth runway for both sides The post confirms this is just phase one, with broader UK distribution planned later in the year. That gives Greencore: incremental volumes,higher-value branded production, deeper relationship with THG/Myprotein And gives Myprotein a bridge from online dominance into offline everyday consumption.. Well done, THG this is a great deal",

If you are right Crafty and reckon Dermstore alone is worth between \u00a3350m-\u00a3500m well that would be a start if he could achieve close to the upper price. Or perhaps selling ESPA for \u00a3200m  would lower the debt to less than \u00a3100m. There are options and don't forget the hedge funds won't want to be short when the VAT reclaim verdict is announced.

If and when an RNS lands, the cost to close could escalate very quickly. We\u2019ve all seen how this can move 20% in a heartbeat.

THG Q4 Earnings Call \u201cStrong Return to Growth\u201d \u2013 Or Just Easy Comparatives? \u2022\tThe 7% Q4 growth is viewed by critics as largely a function of easy prior-year comparisons, following multiple years of contraction rather than a true acceleration. \u2022\tForum users note that management has repeatedly talked up \u201cstrong H2 momentum\u201d in previous years, only for growth to fade again. \u2022\tThe claim that H2 came 14% ahead of guidance is treated with scepticism, as THG has a long history of guidance resets, lowered bars, and selective framing. \u2022\t\u201cBroad-based growth\u201d is questioned, with bears arguing that growth is uneven and still dependent on promotions and discounting, not organic demand strength. \u2e3b Beauty \u201cExceptional\u201d \u2013 But at What Cost? \u2022\tThe 6.4% Q4 beauty growth is seen as underwhelming relative to the amount of marketing spend and discounting required to achieve it. \u2022\tCritics on LSE highlight that growth in Lookfantastic UK & Ireland (+16.2%) likely reflects: \u2022\tHeavy promotional activity \u2022\tLoyalty incentives that compress margins \u2022\tPull-forward demand rather than sustainable expansion \u2022\tRecord retention and higher spend per customer are viewed cautiously, with posters noting: \u2022\tLoyalty schemes often mask churn by subsidising repeat purchases \u2022\tIncreased spend may be inflation-driven, not volume-led \u2022\tTikTok and social-driven trends are considered highly fickle, with little moat and rapid reversals in consumer behaviour. \u2e3b Offline Beauty Stores \u2013 High Risk, Low Proof \u2022\tThe Altrincham store being \u201cahead of expectations\u201d is dismissed by sceptics as: \u2022\tA single data point \u2022\tLocated in an affluent catchment area unlikely to be representative \u2022\tProfitability claims are questioned due to: \u2022\tLack of disclosed store-level economics \u2022\tNo clarity on rent, staffing, or capex assumptions \u2022\tThe so-called \u201chalo effect\u201d is viewed as unquantified marketing spin, something THG has frequently cited without hard evidence. \u2022\tBears argue store expansion introduces: \u2022\tFixed costs \u2022\tExecution risk \u2022\tA move away from the asset-light e-commerce model THG once sold investors \u2e3b Nutrition Growth \u2013 Margin Pressure Still the Elephant in the Room \u2022\t8.5% Q4 growth in Nutrition is viewed as modest given the category\u2019s historical growth rates. \u2022\tClaims of Myprotein being the \u201cworld\u2019s number one\u201d brand are criticised as: \u2022\tMarketing language without independently verifiable metrics \u2022\tUS retail listings (GNC, Kroger) are seen as: \u2022\tLower-margin wholesale channels \u2022\tLikely to dilute brand positioning and profitability \u2022\tElevated whey prices are not dismissed as \u201ctemporary\u201d by critics, who argue: \u2022\tStructural protein demand + geopolitics = permanently higher input costs \u2022\tTHG lacks sufficient pricing power to fully pass these through \u2022\tActivewear growth is viewed as: \u2022\tA crowded, low-loyalty category \u2022\tHistorically poor margin territory for DTC bran",

Strong Return to Growth * Q4 revenue grew 7%, driven by a very strong second half. * H2 performance came in **14% ahead of the top end of guidance, highlighting improving execution. * Growth was broad-based across core divisions. Beauty Performing Exceptionally Well * THG Beauty grew 6.4% in Q4, well ahead of expectations. * Lookfantastic UK & Ireland delivered **16.2% growth**, supported by: * Record customer retention * Growing loyalty membership * Higher spend per customer * Management highlighted strong momentum in devices, apps, loyalty schemes and social-driven beauty trends (including TikTok influence). Offline beauty is also proving successful: * The first Lookfantastic store in Altrincham has traded significantly ahead of expectations. * The store is profitable **and** delivering a measurable online \u201chalo effect\u201d. * Additional stores are planned, using a disciplined, brand-partnered rollout strategy. Nutrition Continues to Grow * THG Nutrition grew 8.5% in Q4. * Myprotein remains the world\u2019s number one sports nutrition brand. * Offline expansion continues, with new U.S. listings at major retailers including GNC and Kroger launching in H1 2026. While whey prices remain elevated, management stressed: * Global protein demand is at record levels * Commodity cycles are temporary * The long-term market opportunity has significantly expanded High-margin categories such as activewear are growing strongly and are expected to exceed **15% of Myprotein revenue mix in 2026**. Business Simplification Largely Complete * Portfolio optimisation in beauty (exiting lower-return regions) is now largely annualised. * Non-core asset disposals and operational streamlining are complete. * This sets up **cleaner comparisons and improved efficiency** going into 2026. Confident Outlook for 2026 Management repeatedly emphasized confidence in trading momentum: * Expected **FY26 EBITDA around \u00a3100m** * Forecast **\u00a320\u201325m of free cash flow** * Continued investment in marketing to support sustainable long-term growth * Increased use of AI and personalization tools across beauty CEO Matthew Moulding stated the group enters 2026 with significant momentum and a stronger, more focused operating model. VAT Upside Optionality * THG is awaiting the outcome of HMRC\u2019s final appeal attempt. * Potential VAT repayment has grown to approximately \u00a355m. * Management has taken a prudent approach, continuing to pay VAT while the case concludes. * Any successful outcome would represent a material cash inflow for the group.",

But every quarter rolls in like a busted-down truck, Numbers keep on missin\u2019 and the margins just\u2026 suck. \ud83c\udfb6 Chorus Oh it\u2019s profits on the promise, but losses in the books, Every update\u2019s thinner than a Nashville bar\u2019s free looks. They keep sayin\u2019 \u201cnext quarter,\u201d yeah, I\u2019ve heard that song before, At THG headquarters by the never-profit door. Now you gotta tip your hat where the credit\u2019s due, Matthew Moulding\u2019s drivin\u2019, yeah he\u2019s seen it through\u2014 Seen it through the mud and straight into the red, With big bold visions and the shareholders misled. He talks scale and strategy, platforms built to fly, But the earnings call comes round and the guidance starts to cry. It\u2019s ambition on a billboard, execution on a slide, And the share price just keeps lookin\u2019 for a place to hide. \ud83c\udfb6 Chorus Oh it\u2019s profits on the promise, but losses in the books, Every update\u2019s thinner than a Nashville bar\u2019s free looks. They keep sayin\u2019 \u201cnext quarter,\u201d yeah, I\u2019ve heard that song before, At THG headquarters by the never-profit door. So play it soft on the fiddle, play it sad on the steel, For investors still hopin\u2019 it\u2019ll someday turn real. \u2018Til then we\u2019ll read the updates with a stiff drink in hand, Singin\u2019 \u201cone day soon\u201d\u2026 like a long-lost country band.",

Ryder added: \u2018So there's a shift in how consumers are socialising now, and it is more towards health and wellness. They're literally ditching pubs and bars for gyms and running clubs.'",

John, you\u2019re right that the sportswear category is seeing exceptional growth and also really strong margin progression as well. To such an extent, it\u2019s quite quickly becoming our highest gross profit category. At this rate, it\u2019s right up there pushing the likes of vitamins, which is a very high gross profit margin. It\u2019s a deliberate strategy that we\u2019re building upon where obviously Whey protein as a core category remains super important for the consumer, but it\u2019s one of the lower margin categories, especially when you consider potential for whey volatility. There are a number of ways we\u2019ve been tackling that over the past couple of years, and clothing is one of those. The bitumen build out is another. The offline partnerships, the licensing as well, is really key.",

Product is out there. How much, I think, look, to give you a small fact on that, the M\u00fcller as an example had the selling to retailers in M\u00fcller. Now I think we\u2019re on our third month of 2 million Myprotein units. Into retail in a month for three consecutive months. I know it\u2019s certainly two. I\u2019m expecting the third month when I see the data to come through with the same as well. The sellout is a bit different, but obviously we\u2019re interested in the selling just as much,were 2 million units just in protein. Yogurts under the M\u00fcller partnership. That gives you an idea of the extent of the touch points that we have in that. If you were to look at Iceland as a retailer, we\u2019re probably doing in the region of about \u00a370 million a year of frozen meals with Iceland across two different types of ranges that we have with them. Now the average meal is somewhere in the region of about \u00a33.50. I think given all the average product, there are some cheaper products than that they sell. You get an idea there. There\u2019s, you know, \u00a320 million of products probably going out the door just in frozen foods and that\u2019s pretty much limited to Iceland. There are some other distribution points, but it\u2019s very successful for them. They do control distribution of that and they do have an exclusive on that range of products in there.",

          "content": "Positive feedback on the partnership 1. A powerful strategic fit Greencore Group plc is one of the UK\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s largest convenience food producers \u2014 supplying sandwiches, wraps, ready meals and other chilled products. It\u2019s also the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. So partnering with them gives Myprotein instant credibility and best-in-class manufacturing, distribution and category expertise. For Greencore, working with the UK\u2019s biggest sports nutrition brand positions them at the heart of the high-growth, high-protein convenience market rather than just traditional sandwiches. 2. Major retail validation Launching in 500+ Sainsbury\u2019s stores and inside the meal deal space is a huge achievement. Meal deals drive some of the highest footfall and repeat purchase in UK grocery \u2014 this puts Myprotein in front of millions of mainstream consumers, not just gym enthusiasts. 3. Category expansion done the right way Moving from powders and supplements into fresh, ready-to-eat food is a bold step. Doing it via Greencore shows a smart, asset-light strategy: leverage an expert partner instead of building complex chilled manufacturing in-house. 4. Products that match consumer trends Up to 28g protein, <376 calories, strong flavours like Firecracker and Teriyaki \u2014 this hits exactly what shoppers want: Healthier Convenience, High protein,Great taste with no \u201cdiet food\u201d compromise Perfect for the growing audience of hybrid workers and time-poor consumers. 5. Growth runway for both sides The post confirms this is just phase one, with broader UK distribution planned later in the year. That gives Greencore: incremental volumes,higher-value branded production, deeper relationship with THG/Myprotein And gives Myprotein a bridge from online dominance into offline everyday consumption.. Well done, THG this is a great deal",

This plan to give away product for break even for market share is great, if he can then increase the price. I have worked with retailers you when have been asked to accept increases, have either said no or just removed off the shelf. This is where Matt is putting all bets on whey as their prices will stay the same agreed (hopefully) and then profit will flow in. Cannot see him putting up prices unless it is part of the deal to get in the door and review return sales. \ud83d\udcaf Matt needs to sell an asset and give something back to shareholders. I\u2019m one third of the business down and more shares in the pot than before. For nothing Again Matt, if you are on here. Give something back that we all deserve. Sale, divi from tax money back, share buy back to help or Matt and our mute chairman to admit failings and sort themselves out. Any of these, shorts will start to take their money and bully another share. It is plainly obvious to even the amateur investor. No one could argue and manipulate then because actions always speak louder than words. Sort it Matt, you owe thousands of people who backed you.",

Don't ever play poker as you 'tell' is sooooo obvious :) THG Beauty Revenue = \u00a31.1bn Warpaint Revenue = \u00a3105M THG Revenue is 10 times more than Warpaint Yet Beauty's market cap estimate of \u00a3300M is less than double Warpaint's market cap of \u00a3177M In its arsenal, THG Beauty has a company called Dermstore. Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples, often in the 1.5x - 3x revenue range. If THG decided to sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. That is more than double the MC of Warpaint at its lower end valuation. Cmon Matty, sell another asset, and let's all go to the pub :)",

          "content": "Stan, you\u2019re trying to compare two businesses that are structured in completely different ways. APN is a focused retailer with a narrow product set, whereas THG is an integrated global platform that is home to 2 powerhouses: Beauty & Nutrition. Lumping all of THG\u2019s \u00a31.7bn revenue against APN\u2019s \u00a3105m and expecting the same margin profile simply isn\u2019t a like-for-like comparison. Over \u00a31.1bn of THG revenue comes from Beauty, a category with very different margin dynamics to protein powders, and nothing to do with whey input costs. THG also owns assets APN doesn\u2019t. Capex has already fallen sharply post-demerger and net debt is down materially, which shows the model is moving in the right direction. APN making \u00a330m on \u00a3105m sales is great, but it operates a far simpler model with far less infrastructure. THG is building a global brand and that inevitably distorts short-term P&L versus a pure retailer. As cash flow turns positive in 2026, the operating leverage will start to show. An audit wouldn\u2019t magically strip out \u00a3150m \u2013 most of those costs support owned assets and capabilities APN simply doesn\u2019t have. Compare the right segments on a like-for-like basis and the picture looks very different. And guess what -  MyProtein in its infancy was making \u00a330M on \u00a3100M revenue Lastly, what happened to 'It's not THG's fault, it's the fault of the Hedge Funds' we had 100s of those posts from you last year - have you flipped :) Stanleyb Posted in: THG Posts: 3,836 Fines, fines, fines...28 Oct 2025 10:24 Fines, fines, fines..!!!

So there are more shares than before and a third less of the business. That my colleagues is painful in any explanation. Let\u2019s hope that Matt is getting tired of the city foot on his head and allows him to boot the chairman and take his place. No matter how it is spinned, we need fresh management blood, performance based target on profitability. I do believe ingenuity is sapping the life out of THG, why would others use it. I believe he took as much of it out before demerger and is betting on market share to support growth then profit. Would the supermarkets be willing to pay extra and they still have the counter space??? Hence everything just hinge on whey reduction for now.",

At that time, the deal was at roughly 1.8\u00d7 forward revenue and added significant US beauty sales to THG\u2019s portfolio. Given that Dermstore has probably grown its revenue and profit since it was purchased, a buyer is likely to pay a higher valuation multiple than what Target did, especially if Dermstore is now more profitable or has stronger market positioning. Link to strong market positioning: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wearethg_wearethg-activity-7422688274114072576-uv3b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADGjivYBi98_Kr0ghVvJn-kmg4bPEKZKahI Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples (depending on growth/EBITDA), often in the 1.5\u00d7\u20133\u00d7 revenue range if earnings are robust and predictable. If they did sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. And here is the crazy thing, if it sold at the upper end of \u00a3500M then that is not that far from the current MC",

Flash crash downwards. Positive sentiment turns to FUD. But lets recall; Positive media after and of 3 Brokers. One Broker upgraded quickly after (Jefferies) from 55p to 60p. Another maintained 80p guidance and Lastly JPM Cazenove reiterated a Target Price of 55p. No Sell recommendations. 22 Jan 26. Extra Bonus shares listed and admitted - 40,611,605 Many querying why these were awarded, after the the poor share price performance. No real share price reaction initially - but then it falls in the days after. Possible seller? 29th Jan 26. Linkedin post by Matt Moulding. Highlighting the current state of the UK market and querying when things will be addressed. Share price falls on the day and has fallen further today. Honest Injun - No rush of buyers either at just over 37p So much so that this is the case. THG Revenue.  \u00a31.716 BILLION. Market Capitalisation: \u00a3579.49M Applied Nutrition (APN) Revenue. \u00a3107.1 MILLION Market Capitalisation: \u00a3582.5M But one, THG is generating  X 17 the revenue of APN. Significantly so. Virtually 6X also that on Nutrition. Sum of Parts of THG also far in excess. Yet they are actually valued less than APN. Then just to put things in perspective THG is actually being valued at less than the top end of the \u00a3400M to \u00a3600M speculative preliminary conditional offer that Selkirk Group made for THG Nutrition alone.  Meaning THG Beauty a \u00a31.1 Billion Revenue generator consisting of multiple businesses and Brands is effectively valued for FREE. https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SELK/response-to-statement-by-thg-plc-e3rw7vvgabgzb48.html Not wishing to be impertinent but yes you can blame the market but seriously any company you would expect also to look inward and to have a full scrum down, thorough review, dissection and implement improvement measures if necessary. For instance: Do we need to have Analyst meetings tagged to Trading updates when others don't bother. RNS Content the same - taking lessons out of others RNS with favourable reaction. Best practice. Might less be more. (See BOO, See APN and countless others). Participants if we do - do all contribute, are they media trained or media competent? Are these Linkedin postings actually benefiting group shareholders? Virtually every time these are posted then the share price goes down. Also why no Investor Relations engagement with shareholders. Might this not help resolve issues, FUD and misinformation. Then perhaps the biggest question. Is the share price ever going to recover to meaningful value and get out of this constancy of rise and fall with the present CEO, BoD, Strategy? Does it need a reshuffling or refreshing? My thoughts only. Enjoy your weekends.",

I don't know why but I think I will just keep adding if it keeps dropping. My belief is also that if there is nothing sinister at the background that we don't know about this company should be able to deliver a decent profit. And if it does I cannot see the reason why the SP should not reach \u00a31+. I have been a holder of CURRYs for a very long time because I was always in red. but held it until last year and sold out.

That, and no doubt helped along the way by those setting the price and those who benefit from churning volume, for incredibly the market price setting must have this now about Absolute Parity with APN in terms of Market Cap. The difference last night was only a mere \u00a320 million. Absolutely astonishing really that both have similar market caps, when one (THG) generates \u00a31.7Billion of Revenue against the others (APN) only just over \u00a3100 Million of Revenue, a difference of a Factor 17 - and THG has a Beauty division completely distinct from Nutrition and generating about \u00a31.1 Billion revenues. Yes one might have Profit and the other not,  but then again one also has \u00a355million sat in a pending  VAT refund, and the other probably hasn't. Just read the Linkedin post from last night and sorry to say it, but it's not how to win friends and influence people. That said  are you just meant to sit silent and watch whilst you're share price gets car crashed back and forward so some hedge fund or funds make \u00a3100's of millions through manipulation and by devaluing your share prices, - when the actual update actually read quite well. And was now over 2 weeks ago (13th Jan). Rightfully imo he does ask When? is something actually going to be done about this, as it's detrimental to the London Stock Exchange and AIM, with net withdrawals and no new listings. Maybe from a shareholder perspective, and years of this, you have to ask if this is being  targeted due to one or more Individuals at the top and actually in the longer term interests of shareholders is it not time to be looking at making some changes. Shame really for it was actually starting to look and trade like a FTSE 250 company, with a relatively stable share price and tight'ish range. Never moan though at the price that's presented to you. Might go cheaper still, might go higher. Staged entry always the better strategy imvho. Each decides their own respective strategy. Just my take on things.",

Everyone knew THG was discounting to bring up subscriptions, raise brand profile and such. So it is no surprise as far as I am concerned that EBITDA was maintained as forecast. The fact is they sold more, maybe got more subscriptions and brand awareness. More people sampling the brands and thus securing more growth which will help when they start to unwind the deals a little bit.",

I mean the globalist world we live happily allows this to occur. And rather than pay out hard cash to staff he can easy dilute shareholders every year with no cost to him. I bet many must juts sell straight away and maybe that is Matt\u2019s plan. He knows his staff can see the SP keep dropping so they will sell as soon as shares land. He probably counts on that as means to drive the share price lower.  Rinse repeat and keep the company out of profit until he can miraculously rescue it and take private.",

THG IMHO will make profits and will eventually pay a dividend. That is why I am here, I am here for the long haul and will continue to buy when I can and post facts when I see them.  A lot of my posts get deleted, mostly the ones with factual links. Take from that what you will. This is one of the reasons why I don't post as often as I used to.  The very same posters who are ripping into MM now are the same posters who were screaming don't take up the allocation. Ingenuity is worthless. How wrong they were on that one, and how wrong they will be in the very near future about THG's profitability. Good Luck, One All TTFN  :)",

I'm not asking for anyone to short this, or sell their shares or for a riot to start between us. All I'm asking is ask more, demand more. Ask more of MM, and IR team. Demand more proof, insights. Lets stick up for what we worth as together we have a lot of share percentage so lets unite in stopping any shadiness, preventing more of it and lets stick together and demand more light on stuff. That can only be a good thing right. This is still undervalued that is a certainty, but it could also be taken away from us at an even greater loss.

You can\u2019t isolate a margin gap and label it the Ingenuity tax. 2 Related-party payments are not theft \u2014 they\u2019re disclosed, audited, and priced under transfer-pricing rules The MSA was approved by the board, reviewed by auditors, and disclosed in full. If fees were inflated, auditors and regulators would not allow them. Related-party transactions,  value extraction \u2014 they exist in almost every demerged structure. 3 The tech wasn\u2019t given away, Ingenuity was moved so it could be valued, sold, or partnered independently. That\u2019s exactly what investors had been demanding for years. THG still has full contractual access \u2014 nothing was lost. 4 Debt staying with RemainCo is normal in demergers Debt follows cash-generating businesses (Nutrition & Beauty). That\u2019s standard corporate finance, not a dump. Bottom line: There is zero evidence of theft, only a standard demerger structure that the market may or may not like.  If this were a screw job, it would not have been signed off on by the auditors, regulators, banks, and major shareholders. Without actual proof, this is noise with an agenda. The share price is being manipulated of that there is no doubt. Everybody knows it.",

Look at the \"Average number of employees\" note. The Trend: You will likely see the headcount at THG Public drop significantly (as tech/warehouse staff moved to Ingenuity). The \"Screw Job\": Even though the staff are gone, the \"Distribution Costs\" line item on the Income Statement didn't drop by the same amount. Instead, the cost just changed names from \"Wages\" to \"Service Fees.\" You are paying the same (or more) for staff you no longer employ or control. Summary: The Single Chart to Look For If you only look at one thing, find the \"Segmental Adjusted EBITDA\" chart in the H1 2025 presentation. Visual Proof: You will see a bar for THG Nutrition that is tiny compared to 2 years ago. Ask yourself: \"Did people stop eating protein?\" No (see Applied Nutrition). \"Did the warehouse get more expensive?\" Yes.",

Here is your \"Do It Yourself\" Audit Kit to prove THG Public (You) is being drained by Ingenuity Private (Moulding). PROOF #1: The \"Same Ingredients, Different Profit\" Test The Document: THG Interim Results H1 2025 (Released Sept 2025) vs. Applied Nutrition FY25 Results (Released Nov 2025). The Test: Both companies buy the exact same raw material (Whey Protein). Both sell to the same customers. Go to THG\u2019s H1 2025 Report: Look for the Segmental Breakdown table. Find: THG Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it collapsed to ~3.9%. (Management blamed \"high whey prices\"). Go to Applied Nutrition\u2019s FY25 Report: Look for the Financial Highlights page. Find: EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it sits at ~30%. The Conclusion: If \"high whey prices\" were the real problem, Applied Nutrition would have crashed too. They didn't. The ~26% difference is almost entirely the \"Ingenuity Tax\"\u2014the inflated fees THG Nutrition is forced to pay for warehousing and tech. PROOF #2: The \"Related Party\" Leak The Document: THG Demerger Circular (Published Nov 2024) or the H1 2025 Financial Statements. The Test: Find the money leaving the building. Go to the \"Related Party Transactions\" Note: This is usually Note 18 or similar in the back of the accounts. Find: \"Amounts payable to THG Ingenuity.\" The Number: In 2024/2025, this figure runs into the hundreds of millions. The \"Kick in the Teeth\": Look for the \"Master Services Agreement (MSA)\" terms in the Demerger Circular. It explicitly states the contract is for 10 years. This proves you are legally locked into paying these fees until ~2035, regardless of whether you make a profit. PROOF #3: The \"Debt Dump\" The Document: THG H1 2025 Balance Sheet. The Test: Who kept the mortgage, and who got the house? Look at \"Net Debt\": You will see THG Public (RemainCo) holds roughly \u00a3321 million in net debt. Look at \"Intangible Assets\": You will see a massive drop because the proprietary technology (the \"Ingenuity Platform\" IP) was transferred to the Private Company. The Conclusion: The Public Company kept the debt (the burden) but gave away the tech assets (the potential growth). You are now paying rent to use the technology you used to own, while still paying off the bank loans used to build it.",

Look, as you would expect, since we\u2019ve announced the sale of Claremont, there\u2019s obviously a lot of interest in the background as to some of our other manufacturing assets in particular and the performances of that. It would be fair to say we\u2019ve had formal approaches on some of those assets. We\u2019re pretty clear as to how we stand on these things, which is the private market valuations, as we saw with Claremont, are robust. If we receive interest in an asset where we believe we can make a deal work for us without in any way negatively impacting the existing business models of either nutrition or beauty, then sure, we will entertain that and know and derive a fair valuation for one of those assets, especially if it\u2019s of a material value. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s like with Claremont, it was \u00a3100 million plus consideration, then sure, we would do that, especially given the valuations that are on, you know, of THG and the wider PLC market today. I think that\u2019s probably as deep as I should go into that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty frank and open to say, look, we could quite readily put an RNS out at any point to say we\u2019ve done a transaction. It would be something that\u2019s relatively non-core at a fair market value that delivers something that we\u2019re pretty pleased with. How long will that be before we do that? Who knows? It will depend on achieving the right price points, if those prices arrive. That\u2019s probably as much as I can say right now.",

Coke backed Monster ten years ago with a $2bn investment for a 17% holding. That $2bn represented less than 1% of Coke\u2019s value. Monster has revenues of \u00a35.6bn, a market cap of \u00a348.1bn with small debt giving an EV/Sales of 8.6x. Monster\u2019s share price is up 40x over 20 years. Coke\u2019s $2bn investment is now worth around $8bn, driven by Monster\u2019s push through Coke\u2019s distribution network. Celsius, the US-listed health drink, offers a similar story. Pepsi is an 11% shareholder and global distribution partner. Pepsi bought into Celsius in 2022 and in August 2025 with another $500m. Pepsi has invested over $1bn for its 11% stake which is less than 1% of its mkt cap. Celsius\u2019s mkt cap is \u00a311.1bn with revenue of \u00a31.0bn last year being an 11x sales multiple. Its share price is up c.30x in just five years. Lotus Bakeries, the Dutch-listed food business behind Lotus Biscoff, shows that you don\u2019t need to be Coke-sized to achieve strong valuations. Its health division includes Trek and Nak\u2019d bars, both acquired over the past five years. Lotus has a mkt cap of \u00a35.7bn with small debt with \u00a31.1bn revenue in 2024 and trades on an EV/Sales of 5.4x. Fevertree, a UK stock partnered with Molson in January 2025 which invested \u00a370m for an 8.5% stake (around 1% of Molson\u2019s mkt cap). Fevertree has sales of \u00a3360m last year and a mkt cap of \u00a31bn, giving EV/Sales of 2.7x. Molson has the capability to significantly accelerate Fevertree\u2019s growth. As for THG, its mkt cap is \u00a3540m with \u00a3200m net debt, giving an EV of \u00a3740m. Total sales post-demerger last year were \u00a31.7bn, of which \u00a3580m came from THG Nutrition (MyProtein) and the balance from THG Beauty. If we split value 50/50, MyProtein trades on c. 0.6x sales. MyProtein appears to be on the radar screen of several global brands such as Muller and the new unnamed global confectioner who appear to want to work with them on product development.",

Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

It seems to be quite a clever move for THG being (maybe) the only player to keep charging VAT.. because if the VAT refund comes, THG won't be under any obligation to refund the VAT to individual consumers under legislation it seems?..

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

How the World Cup (and major sports events) benefits THG/Myprotein: Increased Sales: Major tournaments boost global interest in fitness and nutrition, leading more people to buy protein supplements and related products for muscle recovery and performance. Market Expansion: Partnerships and increased visibility during big events help Myprotein reach wider audiences in new markets, says City AM. Brand Recognition: Being associated with elite sports elevates Myprotein's brand as a go-to for serious athletes and fitness fans. Product Innovation: Demand encourages development of new products, like their animal-free whey, catering to different dietary needs and sustainability concerns, notes Perfect Day. Myprotein's Role & Products: Quality & Differentiation: City AM notes Myprotein differentiates itself with quality, good pricing, and innovative products like protein pancakes and diet whey. Athlete Support: Products like Impact Whey provide essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for muscle repair and growth. Convenience: Products like protein pancake mixes and convenient shakes offer easy ways to meet protein goals. In essence, the global excitement around the World Cup fuels the health and wellness trend, directly benefiting companies like THG and its Myprotein brand by increasing demand for their high-quality, innovative protein solutions.",

An HSA is linked to a high-deductible health plan and the money belongs to the individual forever, rolling over year to year and even earning investment growth. An FSA is provided by employers, also tax-free, but usually must be used within the year with limited rollover. Both can be used for eligible medical and wellness items, and with partners like Flex they can now cover products such as protein powders and creatine, making those purchases significantly cheaper for U.S. consumers.",

Because the money is deducted from paychecks before taxes are taken out, it lowers taxable income, typically resulting in a savings of about 30% on eligible expenses. Key Types of FSAs Health Care FSA (HCFSA): Used for qualified medical, dental, and vision expenses, such as copayments, deductibles, prescription drugs, and medical devices (e.g., crutches, blood sugar test kits). Limited Expense Health Care FSA (LEX HCFSA): Designed for those with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and a Health Savings Account (HSA). It only covers dental and vision expenses, helping preserve HSA funds. Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA): Used to pay for qualified out-of-pocket dependent care expenses, such as preschool, summer day camp, before/after-school programs, and child/adult daycare, allowing employees to work. Rules and Limitations Contribution Limits (2026): For 2026, the maximum contribution to a health care FSA is $3,400 per year. The maximum for a dependent care FSA is $7,500 per household, or $3,750 if married and filing separately. \"Use-It-or-Lose-It\": Unused funds are generally forfeited to the employer at the end of the plan year.",

If you go on market screener and put in THG it gives the same consensus as you have posted but also added extras like net income which is forecast to be loss making 2026 and 2027 though decreasing. (This is analyst forecasts) Interestingly analysts do have FCF as nearly \u00a350 million for 2027. Like I said a disposal/VAT refund will speed up the underlying profitability for the company.",

It\u2019s not just disposals doing the work \u2013 core revenue and margins are improving. FCF turning positive is the first step; lower debt then converts more of that into net profit.

The banks refinancing THG wouldn\u2019t have signed off contracts that left remainco carrying uncommercial terms, and the auditors have to be comfortable that related-party arrangements are on arm\u2019s-length terms. Large shareholders didn\u2019t just shrug and hope for the best either. They had every incentive to challenge anything that disadvantaged THG remainco, because they\u2019re the ones whose value would be destroyed if the contracts were unfair. The idea that the business was carved up with no meaningful scrutiny doesn\u2019t stack up with how these processes actually work in listed companies. Could the terms have been negotiated harder? Maybe \u2013 but to suggest they\u2019re obviously \u201cbad deals\u201d assumes everyone involved ignored their own interests, which seems far less likely than the contracts being broadly commercial and workable for both sides.",

          "content": "Monty, I totally get your point about looking at PAT vs debt \u2014 that\u2019s exactly why the THG picture is improving. Net debt has already been coming down materially. The recent Claremont sale alone brought in around \u00a3100m+ in cash, with proceeds directed to further deleveraging. On top of the earlier refinancing and disposals, THG has taken hundreds of millions off gross debt over the last 18 months, which directly reduces interest costs and improves the PAT outlook. That\u2019s why analysts are now pointing to 2026 as the year THG reports its first genuine net profit. Lower finance charges + improving EBITDA from Nutrition and Beauty = PAT finally turning positive. This isn\u2019t \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d it\u2019s basic mechanics: less debt = less interest = more profit flowing to the bottom line. Also worth remembering THG still has significant assets. We know there is a lot of interest in many of these assets. Another strategic sale or minority stake in one of the premium brands could realistically wipe the debt altogether. If that happened, PAT would step up sharply because the interest burden would almost disappear. So when you talk about a sensible debt/PAT ratio, that\u2019s exactly the path that THG is on \u2014 deleveraging first, profitability second. Calling that gambling ignores the actual balance-sheet progress that\u2019s already happened. I get the point about looking at PAT vs debt \u2014 that\u2019s exactly why the THG picture is improving. But you already know this, don't you Monty? What will you be saying in 2027 - THG is not making ENOUGH profit Then in 2028 - THG's dividends are not BIG ENOUGH I see through you Monty - hopefully others on here will too :)",

          "content": "This is what an AI engine thinks of any Potential partnership deal between THG and Greggs if it were to happen..quite interesting read. JAO \ud83d\ude33 \ud83d\ude33 Here is why a THG (Myprotein) x Greggs partnership would\u2014theoretically\u2014be a brilliant financial move for both: \u200b1. The \"Health-Halo\" for Greggs \u200bGreggs is currently desperate to prove it isn't just a \"sausage roll peddler.\" \u200bThe Problem: Their \"Balanced Choice\" range has been around for years, but it lacks \"street cred\" with the fitness crowd. \u200bThe Solution: A Myprotein-branded \"Power Meal Deal\" at Greggs would give them instant authority. Imagine a \"Myprotein x Greggs\" Chicken & Pesto Pasta or a high-protein breakfast pot. It would turn a \"guilty pleasure\" destination into a legitimate choice for the 14% of UK consumers currently trying to increase protein intake. \u200b2. Physical Footprint for THG \u200bTHG has roughly 2,700 \"doors\" via its recent Sainsbury\u2019s/Greencore deal. \u200bThe Scale: Greggs has over 2,740 shops and is aiming for 3,000. \u200bThe Advantage: A Greggs partnership would effectively double Myprotein\u2019s physical presence overnight. More importantly, it puts Myprotein in high-footfall \"grab-and-go\" locations (train stations, high streets, and petrol stations) where people are looking for a quick, healthy alternative to a pasty. \u200b3. Fighting the \"GLP-1\" Decline \u200bGreggs' CEO, Roisin Currie, admitted in late 2025 that appetite-suppressing drugs are a \"market headwind.\" \u200bPeople on these medications eat less, but when they do eat, they prioritize nutrient density (protein/fibre) to avoid muscle loss. \u200bBy partnering with Myprotein, Greggs could capture the \"reduced-appetite\" spender who is currently walking past their store to go to an M&S Foodhall or a Joe & The Juice. \u200bIs it actually likely? \u200bWhile it makes financial sense, there are two major hurdles: \u200bThe Brand Conflict: Greggs has spent 10 years building its own \"Balanced Choice\" brand. Admitting they need Myprotein's help might be seen as a sign of weakness by their own marketing team. \u200bThe Greencore Exclusive: It\u2019s possible that THG\u2019s new deal with Greencore (who also supplies many of the UK's top retailers) might have \"exclusivity clauses\" that prevent Myprotein from doing a direct manufacturing deal with a competitor like Greggs for a set period. \u200bSummary: The \"Bull Case\" for the Share Price \u200bIf Matt Moulding announced a Greggs x Myprotein partnership, the share price would almost certainly re-test that 51p level or higher. It would be seen as the ultimate \"mainstreaming\" of the brand. JAO ADYOR!",

Product is out there. How much, I think, look, to give you a small fact on that, the M\u00fcller as an example had the selling to retailers in M\u00fcller. Now I think we\u2019re on our third month of 2 million Myprotein units. Into retail in a month for three consecutive months. I know it\u2019s certainly two. I\u2019m expecting the third month when I see the data to come through with the same as well. The sellout is a bit different, but obviously we\u2019re interested in the selling just as much,were 2 million units just in protein. Yogurts under the M\u00fcller partnership. That gives you an idea of the extent of the touch points that we have in that. If you were to look at Iceland as a retailer, we\u2019re probably doing in the region of about \u00a370 million a year of frozen meals with Iceland across two different types of ranges that we have with them. Now the average meal is somewhere in the region of about \u00a33.50. I think given all the average product, there are some cheaper products than that they sell. You get an idea there. There\u2019s, you know, \u00a320 million of products probably going out the door just in frozen foods and that\u2019s pretty much limited to Iceland. There are some other distribution points, but it\u2019s very successful for them. They do control distribution of that and they do have an exclusive on that range of products in there.",

          "content": "Positive feedback on the partnership 1. A powerful strategic fit Greencore Group plc is one of the UK\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s largest convenience food producers \u2014 supplying sandwiches, wraps, ready meals and other chilled products. It\u2019s also the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. So partnering with them gives Myprotein instant credibility and best-in-class manufacturing, distribution and category expertise. For Greencore, working with the UK\u2019s biggest sports nutrition brand positions them at the heart of the high-growth, high-protein convenience market rather than just traditional sandwiches. 2. Major retail validation Launching in 500+ Sainsbury\u2019s stores and inside the meal deal space is a huge achievement. Meal deals drive some of the highest footfall and repeat purchase in UK grocery \u2014 this puts Myprotein in front of millions of mainstream consumers, not just gym enthusiasts. 3. Category expansion done the right way Moving from powders and supplements into fresh, ready-to-eat food is a bold step. Doing it via Greencore shows a smart, asset-light strategy: leverage an expert partner instead of building complex chilled manufacturing in-house. 4. Products that match consumer trends Up to 28g protein, <376 calories, strong flavours like Firecracker and Teriyaki \u2014 this hits exactly what shoppers want: Healthier Convenience, High protein,Great taste with no \u201cdiet food\u201d compromise Perfect for the growing audience of hybrid workers and time-poor consumers. 5. Growth runway for both sides The post confirms this is just phase one, with broader UK distribution planned later in the year. That gives Greencore: incremental volumes,higher-value branded production, deeper relationship with THG/Myprotein And gives Myprotein a bridge from online dominance into offline everyday consumption.. Well done, THG this is a great deal",

THG Q4 Earnings Call \u201cStrong Return to Growth\u201d \u2013 Or Just Easy Comparatives? \u2022\tThe 7% Q4 growth is viewed by critics as largely a function of easy prior-year comparisons, following multiple years of contraction rather than a true acceleration. \u2022\tForum users note that management has repeatedly talked up \u201cstrong H2 momentum\u201d in previous years, only for growth to fade again. \u2022\tThe claim that H2 came 14% ahead of guidance is treated with scepticism, as THG has a long history of guidance resets, lowered bars, and selective framing. \u2022\t\u201cBroad-based growth\u201d is questioned, with bears arguing that growth is uneven and still dependent on promotions and discounting, not organic demand strength. \u2e3b Beauty \u201cExceptional\u201d \u2013 But at What Cost? \u2022\tThe 6.4% Q4 beauty growth is seen as underwhelming relative to the amount of marketing spend and discounting required to achieve it. \u2022\tCritics on LSE highlight that growth in Lookfantastic UK & Ireland (+16.2%) likely reflects: \u2022\tHeavy promotional activity \u2022\tLoyalty incentives that compress margins \u2022\tPull-forward demand rather than sustainable expansion \u2022\tRecord retention and higher spend per customer are viewed cautiously, with posters noting: \u2022\tLoyalty schemes often mask churn by subsidising repeat purchases \u2022\tIncreased spend may be inflation-driven, not volume-led \u2022\tTikTok and social-driven trends are considered highly fickle, with little moat and rapid reversals in consumer behaviour. \u2e3b Offline Beauty Stores \u2013 High Risk, Low Proof \u2022\tThe Altrincham store being \u201cahead of expectations\u201d is dismissed by sceptics as: \u2022\tA single data point \u2022\tLocated in an affluent catchment area unlikely to be representative \u2022\tProfitability claims are questioned due to: \u2022\tLack of disclosed store-level economics \u2022\tNo clarity on rent, staffing, or capex assumptions \u2022\tThe so-called \u201chalo effect\u201d is viewed as unquantified marketing spin, something THG has frequently cited without hard evidence. \u2022\tBears argue store expansion introduces: \u2022\tFixed costs \u2022\tExecution risk \u2022\tA move away from the asset-light e-commerce model THG once sold investors \u2e3b Nutrition Growth \u2013 Margin Pressure Still the Elephant in the Room \u2022\t8.5% Q4 growth in Nutrition is viewed as modest given the category\u2019s historical growth rates. \u2022\tClaims of Myprotein being the \u201cworld\u2019s number one\u201d brand are criticised as: \u2022\tMarketing language without independently verifiable metrics \u2022\tUS retail listings (GNC, Kroger) are seen as: \u2022\tLower-margin wholesale channels \u2022\tLikely to dilute brand positioning and profitability \u2022\tElevated whey prices are not dismissed as \u201ctemporary\u201d by critics, who argue: \u2022\tStructural protein demand + geopolitics = permanently higher input costs \u2022\tTHG lacks sufficient pricing power to fully pass these through \u2022\tActivewear growth is viewed as: \u2022\tA crowded, low-loyalty category \u2022\tHistorically poor margin territory for DTC bran",

Strong Return to Growth * Q4 revenue grew 7%, driven by a very strong second half. * H2 performance came in **14% ahead of the top end of guidance, highlighting improving execution. * Growth was broad-based across core divisions. Beauty Performing Exceptionally Well * THG Beauty grew 6.4% in Q4, well ahead of expectations. * Lookfantastic UK & Ireland delivered **16.2% growth**, supported by: * Record customer retention * Growing loyalty membership * Higher spend per customer * Management highlighted strong momentum in devices, apps, loyalty schemes and social-driven beauty trends (including TikTok influence). Offline beauty is also proving successful: * The first Lookfantastic store in Altrincham has traded significantly ahead of expectations. * The store is profitable **and** delivering a measurable online \u201chalo effect\u201d. * Additional stores are planned, using a disciplined, brand-partnered rollout strategy. Nutrition Continues to Grow * THG Nutrition grew 8.5% in Q4. * Myprotein remains the world\u2019s number one sports nutrition brand. * Offline expansion continues, with new U.S. listings at major retailers including GNC and Kroger launching in H1 2026. While whey prices remain elevated, management stressed: * Global protein demand is at record levels * Commodity cycles are temporary * The long-term market opportunity has significantly expanded High-margin categories such as activewear are growing strongly and are expected to exceed **15% of Myprotein revenue mix in 2026**. Business Simplification Largely Complete * Portfolio optimisation in beauty (exiting lower-return regions) is now largely annualised. * Non-core asset disposals and operational streamlining are complete. * This sets up **cleaner comparisons and improved efficiency** going into 2026. Confident Outlook for 2026 Management repeatedly emphasized confidence in trading momentum: * Expected **FY26 EBITDA around \u00a3100m** * Forecast **\u00a320\u201325m of free cash flow** * Continued investment in marketing to support sustainable long-term growth * Increased use of AI and personalization tools across beauty CEO Matthew Moulding stated the group enters 2026 with significant momentum and a stronger, more focused operating model. VAT Upside Optionality * THG is awaiting the outcome of HMRC\u2019s final appeal attempt. * Potential VAT repayment has grown to approximately \u00a355m. * Management has taken a prudent approach, continuing to pay VAT while the case concludes. * Any successful outcome would represent a material cash inflow for the group.",

He gazes in mirrors, self-love never scolding, A CEO pose that is confident\u2014bold-ing. His dogs sit in meetings, their shares ever growing, He asks for their votes, they just nap without knowing. The chairman says nothing\u2014no nodding, no glowing, So silence approves every plan he\u2019s bestowing. On skis he goes flying, down mountains he\u2019s gliding, From balance sheets though, he appears to be hiding. Conference calls leave investors just sighing, As answers go missing and numbers stop trying. Money slips off like loose change when you\u2019re jogging, Through fingers, through quarters, through forecasts he\u2019s fogging. Yet still Matthew Moulding keeps confidently modelling, A master of talk while the margins need coddling. Still onward he charges, convinced he\u2019s outstanding, With paws on the board and no one demanding A plan that\u2019s less vibes and more fiscal withholding\u2014 Ah Matthew, sweet Matthew, forever moulding.",

Ryder told The Mail last year: 'We're working with companies who are encouraging people to come to nightclubs, but it's to drink protein drinks and do workouts rather than dancing and drinking alcohol.\u2019 Applied Nutrition has partnered with event firms such as \u2018Coffee and Vibes\u2019 who organise fitness classes, followed by healthy food and DJs. Ryder added: \u2018So there's a shift in how consumers are socialising now, and it is more towards health and wellness. They're literally ditching pubs and bars for gyms and running clubs.'",

John, you\u2019re right that the sportswear category is seeing exceptional growth and also really strong margin progression as well. To such an extent, it\u2019s quite quickly becoming our highest gross profit category. At this rate, it\u2019s right up there pushing the likes of vitamins, which is a very high gross profit margin. It\u2019s a deliberate strategy that we\u2019re building upon where obviously Whey protein as a core category remains super important for the consumer, but it\u2019s one of the lower margin categories, especially when you consider potential for whey volatility. There are a number of ways we\u2019ve been tackling that over the past couple of years, and clothing is one of those. The bitumen build out is another. The offline partnerships, the licensing as well, is really key.",

Product is out there. How much, I think, look, to give you a small fact on that, the M\u00fcller as an example had the selling to retailers in M\u00fcller. Now I think we\u2019re on our third month of 2 million Myprotein units. Into retail in a month for three consecutive months. I know it\u2019s certainly two. I\u2019m expecting the third month when I see the data to come through with the same as well. The sellout is a bit different, but obviously we\u2019re interested in the selling just as much,were 2 million units just in protein. Yogurts under the M\u00fcller partnership. That gives you an idea of the extent of the touch points that we have in that. If you were to look at Iceland as a retailer, we\u2019re probably doing in the region of about \u00a370 million a year of frozen meals with Iceland across two different types of ranges that we have with them. Now the average meal is somewhere in the region of about \u00a33.50. I think given all the average product, there are some cheaper products than that they sell. You get an idea there. There\u2019s, you know, \u00a320 million of products probably going out the door just in frozen foods and that\u2019s pretty much limited to Iceland. There are some other distribution points, but it\u2019s very successful for them. They do control distribution of that and they do have an exclusive on that range of products in there.",

A powerful strategic fit Greencore Group plc is one of the UK\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s largest convenience food producers \u2014 supplying sandwiches, wraps, ready meals and other chilled products. It\u2019s also the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. So partnering with them gives Myprotein instant credibility and best-in-class manufacturing, distribution and category expertise. For Greencore, working with the UK\u2019s biggest sports nutrition brand positions them at the heart of the high-growth, high-protein convenience market rather than just traditional sandwiches. 2. Major retail validation Launching in 500+ Sainsbury\u2019s stores and inside the meal deal space is a huge achievement. Meal deals drive some of the highest footfall and repeat purchase in UK grocery \u2014 this puts Myprotein in front of millions of mainstream consumers, not just gym enthusiasts. 3. Category expansion done the right way Moving from powders and supplements into fresh, ready-to-eat food is a bold step. Doing it via Greencore shows a smart, asset-light strategy: leverage an expert partner instead of building complex chilled manufacturing in-house. 4. Products that match consumer trends Up to 28g protein, <376 calories, strong flavours like Firecracker and Teriyaki \u2014 this hits exactly what shoppers want: Healthier Convenience, High protein,Great taste with no \u201cdiet food\u201d compromise Perfect for the growing audience of hybrid workers and time-poor consumers. 5. Growth runway for both sides The post confirms this is just phase one, with broader UK distribution planned later in the year. That gives Greencore: incremental volumes,higher-value branded production, deeper relationship with THG/Myprotein And gives Myprotein a bridge from online dominance into offline everyday consumption.. Well done, THG this is a great deal",

Especially given only negative value is being created by the present strategy of this Board of Directors. Just to put it in perspective - AS Watson can effectively have 50% of Beauty now for Nothing based on what Selkirk were offering.

          "content": "Stan, you\u2019re trying to compare two businesses that are structured in completely different ways. APN is a focused retailer with a narrow product set, whereas THG is an integrated global platform that is home to 2 powerhouses: Beauty & Nutrition. Lumping all of THG\u2019s \u00a31.7bn revenue against APN\u2019s \u00a3105m and expecting the same margin profile simply isn\u2019t a like-for-like comparison. Over \u00a31.1bn of THG revenue comes from Beauty, a category with very different margin dynamics to protein powders, and nothing to do with whey input costs. THG also owns assets APN doesn\u2019t. Capex has already fallen sharply post-demerger and net debt is down materially, which shows the model is moving in the right direction. APN making \u00a330m on \u00a3105m sales is great, but it operates a far simpler model with far less infrastructure. THG is building a global brand and that inevitably distorts short-term P&L versus a pure retailer. As cash flow turns positive in 2026, the operating leverage will start to show. An audit wouldn\u2019t magically strip out \u00a3150m \u2013 most of those costs support owned assets and capabilities APN simply doesn\u2019t have. Compare the right segments on a like-for-like basis and the picture looks very different. And guess what -  MyProtein in its infancy was making \u00a330M on \u00a3100M revenue Lastly, what happened to 'It's not THG's fault, it's the fault of the Hedge Funds' we had 100s of those posts from you last year - have you flipped :) Stanleyb Posted in: THG Posts: 3,836 Fines, fines, fines...28 Oct 2025 10:24 Fines, fines, fines..!!!

Says everyone can go in (can\u2019t) but the share price will increase due to shares removed into ingenuity Then proceeds to stick more back on through his 60 mil plus 40 mil for bonuses (never known I bonus paid for no profit). So there are more shares than before and a third less of the business. That my colleagues is painful in any explanation. Let\u2019s hope that Matt is getting tired of the city foot on his head and allows him to boot the chairman and take his place. No matter how it is spinned, we need fresh management blood, performance based target on profitability. I do believe ingenuity is sapping the life out of THG, why would others use it. I believe he took as much of it out before demerger and is betting on market share to support growth then profit. Would the supermarkets be willing to pay extra and they still have the counter space??? Hence everything just hinge on whey reduction for now.",

At that time, the deal was at roughly 1.8\u00d7 forward revenue and added significant US beauty sales to THG\u2019s portfolio. Given that Dermstore has probably grown its revenue and profit since it was purchased, a buyer is likely to pay a higher valuation multiple than what Target did, especially if Dermstore is now more profitable or has stronger market positioning. Link to strong market positioning: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wearethg_wearethg-activity-7422688274114072576-uv3b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADGjivYBi98_Kr0ghVvJn-kmg4bPEKZKahI Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples (depending on growth/EBITDA), often in the 1.5\u00d7\u20133\u00d7 revenue range if earnings are robust and predictable. If they did sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. And here is the crazy thing, if it sold at the upper end of \u00a3500M then that is not that far from the current MC",

Flash crash downwards. Positive sentiment turns to FUD. But lets recall; Positive media after and of 3 Brokers. One Broker upgraded quickly after (Jefferies) from 55p to 60p. Another maintained 80p guidance and Lastly JPM Cazenove reiterated a Target Price of 55p. No Sell recommendations. 22 Jan 26. Extra Bonus shares listed and admitted - 40,611,605 Many querying why these were awarded, after the the poor share price performance. No real share price reaction initially - but then it falls in the days after. Possible seller? 29th Jan 26. Linkedin post by Matt Moulding. Highlighting the current state of the UK market and querying when things will be addressed. Share price falls on the day and has fallen further today. Honest Injun - No rush of buyers either at just over 37p So much so that this is the case. THG Revenue.  \u00a31.716 BILLION. Market Capitalisation: \u00a3579.49M Applied Nutrition (APN) Revenue. \u00a3107.1 MILLION Market Capitalisation: \u00a3582.5M But one, THG is generating  X 17 the revenue of APN. Significantly so. Virtually 6X also that on Nutrition. Sum of Parts of THG also far in excess. Yet they are actually valued less than APN. Then just to put things in perspective THG is actually being valued at less than the top end of the \u00a3400M to \u00a3600M speculative preliminary conditional offer that Selkirk Group made for THG Nutrition alone.  Meaning THG Beauty a \u00a31.1 Billion Revenue generator consisting of multiple businesses and Brands is effectively valued for FREE. https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SELK/response-to-statement-by-thg-plc-e3rw7vvgabgzb48.html Not wishing to be impertinent but yes you can blame the market but seriously any company you would expect also to look inward and to have a full scrum down, thorough review, dissection and implement improvement measures if necessary. For instance: Do we need to have Analyst meetings tagged to Trading updates when others don't bother. RNS Content the same - taking lessons out of others RNS with favourable reaction. Best practice. Might less be more. (See BOO, See APN and countless others). Participants if we do - do all contribute, are they media trained or media competent? Are these Linkedin postings actually benefiting group shareholders? Virtually every time these are posted then the share price goes down. Also why no Investor Relations engagement with shareholders. Might this not help resolve issues, FUD and misinformation. Then perhaps the biggest question. Is the share price ever going to recover to meaningful value and get out of this constancy of rise and fall with the present CEO, BoD, Strategy? Does it need a reshuffling or refreshing?

Name me one other CEO of a ftse company that conducts himself like Moulding and because he has the vast wealth from IPO can acts in his own interests first. To him it's his company not a company that he works for and making decisions that are in the best interest of other THG shareholders doesn't seem his priority.. I'm so fed up with this stock and Moulding but unfortunately keep holding on for years now thinking this is going to turn and I'll recover my big losses.  I hope it does for all of us..",

However since than I have been adding around 40p few days ago and today at38p. It is just so frustrating that it just keep going down. I don't know why but I think I will just keep adding if it keeps dropping. My belief is also that if there is nothing sinister at the background that we don't know about this company should be able to deliver a decent profit. And if it does I cannot see the reason why the SP should not reach \u00a31+. I have been a holder of CURRYs for a very long time because I was always in red. but held it until last year and sold out. Company has tripled its SP in less than three years. GLA",

That, and no doubt helped along the way by those setting the price and those who benefit from churning volume, for incredibly the market price setting must have this now about Absolute Parity with APN in terms of Market Cap. The difference last night was only a mere \u00a320 million. Absolutely astonishing really that both have similar market caps, when one (THG) generates \u00a31.7Billion of Revenue against the others (APN) only just over \u00a3100 Million of Revenue, a difference of a Factor 17 - and THG has a Beauty division completely distinct from Nutrition and generating about \u00a31.1 Billion revenues. Yes one might have Profit and the other not,  but then again one also has \u00a355million sat in a pending  VAT refund, and the other probably hasn't. Just read the Linkedin post from last night and sorry to say it, but it's not how to win friends and influence people. That said  are you just meant to sit silent and watch whilst you're share price gets car crashed back and forward so some hedge fund or funds make \u00a3100's of millions through manipulation and by devaluing your share prices, - when the actual update actually read quite well. And was now over 2 weeks ago (13th Jan). Rightfully imo he does ask When? is something actually going to be done about this, as it's detrimental to the London Stock Exchange and AIM, with net withdrawals and no new listings. Maybe from a shareholder perspective, and years of this, you have to ask if this is being  targeted due to one or more Individuals at the top and actually in the longer term interests of shareholders is it not time to be looking at making some changes. Shame really for it was actually starting to look and trade like a FTSE 250 company, with a relatively stable share price and tight'ish range. Never moan though at the price that's presented to you. Might go cheaper still, might go higher. Staged entry always the better strategy imvho. Each decides their own respective strategy. Just my take on things.",

Everyone knew THG was discounting to bring up subscriptions, raise brand profile and such. So it is no surprise as far as I am concerned that EBITDA was maintained as forecast. The fact is they sold more, maybe got more subscriptions and brand awareness. More people sampling the brands and thus securing more growth which will help when they start to unwind the deals a little bit.",

I mean the globalist world we live happily allows this to occur. And rather than pay out hard cash to staff he can easy dilute shareholders every year with no cost to him. I bet many must juts sell straight away and maybe that is Matt\u2019s plan. He knows his staff can see the SP keep dropping so they will sell as soon as shares land. He probably counts on that as means to drive the share price lower.  Rinse repeat and keep the company out of profit until he can miraculously rescue it and take private.",

I don't take advice from these boards, and I did take up my allocation of Ingenuity shares. I also get replies from IR for what it is worth. THG IMHO will make profits and will eventually pay a dividend. That is why I am here, I am here for the long haul and will continue to buy when I can and post facts when I see them.  A lot of my posts get deleted, mostly the ones with factual links. Take from that what you will. This is one of the reasons why I don't post as often as I used to.  The very same posters who are ripping into MM now are the same posters who were screaming don't take up the allocation. Ingenuity is worthless. How wrong they were on that one, and how wrong they will be in the very near future about THG's profitability. Good Luck, One All TTFN  :)",

I'm not asking for anyone to short this, or sell their shares or for a riot to start between us. All I'm asking is ask more, demand more. Ask more of MM, and IR team. Demand more proof, insights. Lets stick up for what we worth as together we have a lot of share percentage so lets unite in stopping any shadiness, preventing more of it and lets stick together and demand more light on stuff. That can only be a good thing right. This is still undervalued that is a certainty, but it could also be taken away from us at an even greater loss.

THG Nutrition is multi-brand, DTC-led, global, returns-heavy, and marketing-intensive. They do not have the same cost structure \u2014 whey price is only one input. You can\u2019t isolate a margin gap and label it the Ingenuity tax. 2 Related-party payments are not theft \u2014 they\u2019re disclosed, audited, and priced under transfer-pricing rules The MSA was approved by the board, reviewed by auditors, and disclosed in full. If fees were inflated, auditors and regulators would not allow them. Related-party transactions,  value extraction \u2014 they exist in almost every demerged structure. 3 The tech wasn\u2019t given away, Ingenuity was moved so it could be valued, sold, or partnered independently. That\u2019s exactly what investors had been demanding for years. THG still has full contractual access \u2014 nothing was lost. 4 Debt staying with RemainCo is normal in demergers Debt follows cash-generating businesses (Nutrition & Beauty). That\u2019s standard corporate finance, not a dump. Bottom line: There is zero evidence of theft, only a standard demerger structure that the market may or may not like.  If this were a screw job, it would not have been signed off on by the auditors, regulators, banks, and major shareholders. Without actual proof, this is noise with an agenda. The share price is being manipulated of that there is no doubt. Everybody knows it.",

Look at the \"Average number of employees\" note. The Trend: You will likely see the headcount at THG Public drop significantly (as tech/warehouse staff moved to Ingenuity). The \"Screw Job\": Even though the staff are gone, the \"Distribution Costs\" line item on the Income Statement didn't drop by the same amount. Instead, the cost just changed names from \"Wages\" to \"Service Fees.\" You are paying the same (or more) for staff you no longer employ or control. Summary: The Single Chart to Look For If you only look at one thing, find the \"Segmental Adjusted EBITDA\" chart in the H1 2025 presentation. Visual Proof: You will see a bar for THG Nutrition that is tiny compared to 2 years ago. Ask yourself: \"Did people stop eating protein?\" No (see Applied Nutrition). \"Did the warehouse get more expensive?\" Yes.",

Here is your \"Do It Yourself\" Audit Kit to prove THG Public (You) is being drained by Ingenuity Private (Moulding). PROOF #1: The \"Same Ingredients, Different Profit\" Test The Document: THG Interim Results H1 2025 (Released Sept 2025) vs. Applied Nutrition FY25 Results (Released Nov 2025). The Test: Both companies buy the exact same raw material (Whey Protein). Both sell to the same customers. Go to THG\u2019s H1 2025 Report: Look for the Segmental Breakdown table. Find: THG Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it collapsed to ~3.9%. (Management blamed \"high whey prices\"). Go to Applied Nutrition\u2019s FY25 Report: Look for the Financial Highlights page. Find: EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it sits at ~30%. The Conclusion: If \"high whey prices\" were the real problem, Applied Nutrition would have crashed too. They didn't. The ~26% difference is almost entirely the \"Ingenuity Tax\"\u2014the inflated fees THG Nutrition is forced to pay for warehousing and tech. PROOF #2: The \"Related Party\" Leak The Document: THG Demerger Circular (Published Nov 2024) or the H1 2025 Financial Statements. The Test: Find the money leaving the building. Go to the \"Related Party Transactions\" Note: This is usually Note 18 or similar in the back of the accounts. Find: \"Amounts payable to THG Ingenuity.\" The Number: In 2024/2025, this figure runs into the hundreds of millions. The \"Kick in the Teeth\": Look for the \"Master Services Agreement (MSA)\" terms in the Demerger Circular. It explicitly states the contract is for 10 years. This proves you are legally locked into paying these fees until ~2035, regardless of whether you make a profit. PROOF #3: The \"Debt Dump\" The Document: THG H1 2025 Balance Sheet. The Test: Who kept the mortgage, and who got the house? Look at \"Net Debt\": You will see THG Public (RemainCo) holds roughly \u00a3321 million in net debt. Look at \"Intangible Assets\": You will see a massive drop because the proprietary technology (the \"Ingenuity Platform\" IP) was transferred to the Private Company. The Conclusion: The Public Company kept the debt (the burden) but gave away the tech assets (the potential growth). You are now paying rent to use the technology you used to own, while still paying off the bank loans used to build it.",

Look, as you would expect, since we\u2019ve announced the sale of Claremont, there\u2019s obviously a lot of interest in the background as to some of our other manufacturing assets in particular and the performances of that. It would be fair to say we\u2019ve had formal approaches on some of those assets. We\u2019re pretty clear as to how we stand on these things, which is the private market valuations, as we saw with Claremont, are robust. If we receive interest in an asset where we believe we can make a deal work for us without in any way negatively impacting the existing business models of either nutrition or beauty, then sure, we will entertain that and know and derive a fair valuation for one of those assets, especially if it\u2019s of a material value. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s like with Claremont, it was \u00a3100 million plus consideration, then sure, we would do that, especially given the valuations that are on, you know, of THG and the wider PLC market today. I think that\u2019s probably as deep as I should go into that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty frank and open to say, look, we could quite readily put an RNS out at any point to say we\u2019ve done a transaction. It would be something that\u2019s relatively non-core at a fair market value that delivers something that we\u2019re pretty pleased with. How long will that be before we do that? Who knows? It will depend on achieving the right price points, if those prices arrive. That\u2019s probably as much as I can say right now.",

Coke backed Monster ten years ago with a $2bn investment for a 17% holding. That $2bn represented less than 1% of Coke\u2019s value. Monster has revenues of \u00a35.6bn, a market cap of \u00a348.1bn with small debt giving an EV/Sales of 8.6x. Monster\u2019s share price is up 40x over 20 years. Coke\u2019s $2bn investment is now worth around $8bn, driven by Monster\u2019s push through Coke\u2019s distribution network. Celsius, the US-listed health drink, offers a similar story. Pepsi is an 11% shareholder and global distribution partner. Pepsi bought into Celsius in 2022 and in August 2025 with another $500m. Pepsi has invested over $1bn for its 11% stake which is less than 1% of its mkt cap. Celsius\u2019s mkt cap is \u00a311.1bn with revenue of \u00a31.0bn last year being an 11x sales multiple. Its share price is up c.30x in just five years. Lotus Bakeries, the Dutch-listed food business behind Lotus Biscoff, shows that you don\u2019t need to be Coke-sized to achieve strong valuations. Its health division includes Trek and Nak\u2019d bars, both acquired over the past five years. Lotus has a mkt cap of \u00a35.7bn with small debt with \u00a31.1bn revenue in 2024 and trades on an EV/Sales of 5.4x. Fevertree, a UK stock partnered with Molson in January 2025 which invested \u00a370m for an 8.5% stake (around 1% of Molson\u2019s mkt cap). Fevertree has sales of \u00a3360m last year and a mkt cap of \u00a31bn, giving EV/Sales of 2.7x. Molson has the capability to significantly accelerate Fevertree\u2019s growth. As for THG, its mkt cap is \u00a3540m with \u00a3200m net debt, giving an EV of \u00a3740m. Total sales post-demerger last year were \u00a31.7bn, of which \u00a3580m came from THG Nutrition (MyProtein) and the balance from THG Beauty. If we split value 50/50, MyProtein trades on c. 0.6x sales. MyProtein appears to be on the radar screen of several global brands such as Muller and the new unnamed global confectioner who appear to want to work with them on product development.",

To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

It seems to be quite a clever move for THG being (maybe) the only player to keep charging VAT.. because if the VAT refund comes, THG won't be under any obligation to refund the VAT to individual consumers under legislation it seems?.. Therefore the longer that VAT keeps being charged the more money in the pot for THG.. Seeing that MM thinks everyone else has stopped charging the VAT on the affected protein powders, there will obviously be some degree of short term price differential (although MY Protein is very competitively    priced according to MM), ultimately THG will recover more cash, this  assumes that  HMRC fail in their attempt to have the case overturned at a higher VAT tribunal?

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

Best to buy now, rather than later, THG has premium assets, and if they sell one, the SP will move very quickly. Still got my buy order in for 34.8p, so let's see what the baseball furies do tomorrow. Matt if you are reading this, it is time to stop running and turn them all into popsicles :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrEmF4SK3T4",

Doing so is illegal and constitutes a serious breach of UK financial regulations, potentially leading to severe criminal and civil penalties. Listed companies and their officers (including CEOs) are subject to stringent regulations overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), designed to ensure market integrity and transparency. Such actions constitute market abuse and can lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment for the CEO and massive fines for the company. Here is a breakdown of the regulations and consequences based on the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA): 1. The Legal and Regulatory Framework Market Abuse Regulation (MAR): Under MAR, it is illegal to disclose inside information unlawfully or engage in market manipulation. FCA Rules (Disclosure and Transparency Rules - DTR): Listed companies must ensure that any information released is not misleading, false, or deceptive. FSMA Section 397: It is a criminal offence to knowingly or recklessly make a statement, promise, or forecast that is materially misleading, false, or deceptive, or to dishonestly conceal material facts. Section 90A FSMA: This allows investors to claim for losses if they relied on misleading information published to the market.

Even with those higher priced sells overall I am still down on THG but now I have a very low average & another large holding so I\u2019m happy I have time & patience. I prefer shares to property as I can easily cash out certain amounts to travel at anytime as that\u2019s my thing.. Money is to be enjoyed whether it\u2019s winning or losing money it\u2019s still money as those 2 big trips you cannot put a price on..

The recently announced collaboration with Greencore to launch protein-focused food-on-the-go products in Sainsbury\u2019s broadens Myprotein\u2019s reach into mainstream retail and creates optionality to extend into additional formats and channels. This deal reinforces offline and licensing as important growth pillars for THG Nutrition, where Wade anticipates substantial expansion in licensed product revenues by FY26. He views the recent sharp share price decline as disconnected from the company\u2019s prospects, given expectations for a solid year of top-line progress and strong cash generation, and therefore sees the current valuation as an attractive entry point for investors.",

But it\u2019s good to be back as a growth company and current 580m mcap for group is cheap. We know with myprotein in us revenue will also be increasing with the fsa/hsa update on the website yesterday. Something that has helped Dermstore in us with revenue and growth expected there. The forward looking forecasts will be increased in the next update. Still also awaiting the potential vat rebate which will be over \u00a350m.

Moulding has proved to be a massive disappointment, unable to take criticism as seen on LinkedIn, narcissistic as seen on Instagram and driven by self interest. The opportunity cost of being a long term holder here ( 3 years plus) are considerable when you consider the gains that could have been made if your money was invested US Tech stocks and precious metal mining stocks over this time. It could well be a very long time before long time shareholders see any return on their investment. AnnacotSteel1 - You had 250K shares invested here 4 years ago. so you must have quite some resolve to continue to post positively ever since and notify about adding to your position on many occasions. Maybe time for a TR1 :) I have not seen any posts from OohAhhCantona for quite sometime.  I wonder if he still has his large shareholding or whether he has lost the will to live like most LTHs  from back in the day and sold out or sold down.... On a lighter note I see Steve Scott was spotted on here the other day. I do wish he would resurrect Goodtimescoming as that was always my favourite of his many aliases.

For years, investors had borrowed cheaply in yen\u2014thanks to near-zero rates from the Bank of Japan\u2014and invested in higher-yielding assets abroad. When the crisis intensified and Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, markets froze, leverage was unwound, and investors were forced to buy back yen to repay loans. This triggered a powerful short squeeze: USD/JPY fell from around 124 in 2007 to about 87 by late 2008 (roughly a 30% yen appreciation), while high-beta crosses like AUD/JPY collapsed nearly 50%. The move was amplified by global deleveraging, margin calls, and Japan\u2019s status as a net creditor nation, which encouraged capital repatriation and reinforced the yen\u2019s rise.",

An HSA is linked to a high-deductible health plan and the money belongs to the individual forever, rolling over year to year and even earning investment growth. An FSA is provided by employers, also tax-free, but usually must be used within the year with limited rollover. Both can be used for eligible medical and wellness items, and with partners like Flex they can now cover products such as protein powders and creatine, making those purchases significantly cheaper for U.S. consumers.",

          "content": "Potentially tapped a larger market in USA now as spend can be at myprotein in US A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) in the USA is an employer-sponsored, tax-advantaged account that allows employees to set aside a portion of their earnings to pay for eligible medical, dental, vision, or dependent care expenses. Because the money is deducted from paychecks before taxes are taken out, it lowers taxable income, typically resulting in a savings of about 30% on eligible expenses. Key Types of FSAs Health Care FSA (HCFSA): Used for qualified medical, dental, and vision expenses, such as copayments, deductibles, prescription drugs, and medical devices (e.g., crutches, blood sugar test kits). Limited Expense Health Care FSA (LEX HCFSA): Designed for those with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and a Health Savings Account (HSA). It only covers dental and vision expenses, helping preserve HSA funds. Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA): Used to pay for qualified out-of-pocket dependent care expenses, such as preschool, summer day camp, before/after-school programs, and child/adult daycare, allowing employees to work. Rules and Limitations Contribution Limits (2026): For 2026, the maximum contribution to a health care FSA is $3,400 per year. The maximum for a dependent care FSA is $7,500 per household, or $3,750 if married and filing separately. \"Use-It-or-Lose-It\": Unused funds are generally forfeited to the employer at the end of the plan year.",

Analysts are forecasting EBITDA moving toward ~\u00a3100m in 2026, and with interest costs falling after the refinancing and Claremont proceeds, that bridge to positive PAT is getting much shorter. It\u2019s not just disposals doing the work \u2013 core revenue and margins are improving. FCF turning positive is the first step; lower debt then converts more of that into net profit. That\u2019s why many expect 2026, not 2028, to be the year THG moves onto a P/E valuation. Remember, these analysts' predictions do not include the \u00a360M VAT potential windfall or another asset sale. If just one of them comes in, then they will shift up significantly.",

They had every incentive to challenge anything that disadvantaged THG remainco, because they\u2019re the ones whose value would be destroyed if the contracts were unfair. The idea that the business was carved up with no meaningful scrutiny doesn\u2019t stack up with how these processes actually work in listed companies. Could the terms have been negotiated harder? Maybe \u2013 but to suggest they\u2019re obviously \u201cbad deals\u201d assumes everyone involved ignored their own interests, which seems far less likely than the contracts being broadly commercial and workable for both sides.",

          "content": "Monty, I totally get your point about looking at PAT vs debt \u2014 that\u2019s exactly why the THG picture is improving. Net debt has already been coming down materially. The recent Claremont sale alone brought in around \u00a3100m+ in cash, with proceeds directed to further deleveraging. On top of the earlier refinancing and disposals, THG has taken hundreds of millions off gross debt over the last 18 months, which directly reduces interest costs and improves the PAT outlook. That\u2019s why analysts are now pointing to 2026 as the year THG reports its first genuine net profit. Lower finance charges + improving EBITDA from Nutrition and Beauty = PAT finally turning positive. This isn\u2019t \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d it\u2019s basic mechanics: less debt = less interest = more profit flowing to the bottom line. Also worth remembering THG still has significant assets. We know there is a lot of interest in many of these assets. Another strategic sale or minority stake in one of the premium brands could realistically wipe the debt altogether. If that happened, PAT would step up sharply because the interest burden would almost disappear. So when you talk about a sensible debt/PAT ratio, that\u2019s exactly the path that THG is on \u2014 deleveraging first, profitability second. Calling that gambling ignores the actual balance-sheet progress that\u2019s already happened. I get the point about looking at PAT vs debt \u2014 that\u2019s exactly why the THG picture is improving. But you already know this, don't you Monty? What will you be saying in 2027 - THG is not making ENOUGH profit Then in 2028 - THG's dividends are not BIG ENOUGH I see through you Monty - hopefully others on here will too :)",

It would turn a \"guilty pleasure\" destination into a legitimate choice for the 14% of UK consumers currently trying to increase protein intake. \u200b2. Physical Footprint for THG \u200bTHG has roughly 2,700 \"doors\" via its recent Sainsbury\u2019s/Greencore deal. \u200bThe Scale: Greggs has over 2,740 shops and is aiming for 3,000. \u200bThe Advantage: A Greggs partnership would effectively double Myprotein\u2019s physical presence overnight. More importantly, it puts Myprotein in high-footfall \"grab-and-go\" locations (train stations, high streets, and petrol stations) where people are looking for a quick, healthy alternative to a pasty. \u200b3. Fighting the \"GLP-1\" Decline \u200bGreggs' CEO, Roisin Currie, admitted in late 2025 that appetite-suppressing drugs are a \"market headwind.\" \u200bPeople on these medications eat less, but when they do eat, they prioritize nutrient density (protein/fibre) to avoid muscle loss. \u200bBy partnering with Myprotein, Greggs could capture the \"reduced-appetite\" spender who is currently walking past their store to go to an M&S Foodhall or a Joe & The Juice. \u200bIs it actually likely? \u200bWhile it makes financial sense, there are two major hurdles: \u200bThe Brand Conflict: Greggs has spent 10 years building its own \"Balanced Choice\" brand. Admitting they need Myprotein's help might be seen as a sign of weakness by their own marketing team. \u200bThe Greencore Exclusive: It\u2019s possible that THG\u2019s new deal with Greencore (who also supplies many of the UK's top retailers) might have \"exclusivity clauses\" that prevent Myprotein from doing a direct manufacturing deal with a competitor like Greggs for a set period. \u200bSummary: The \"Bull Case\" for the Share Price \u200bIf Matt Moulding announced a Greggs x Myprotein partnership, the share price would almost certainly re-test that 51p level or higher. It would be seen as the ultimate \"mainstreaming\" of the brand. JAO ADYOR!",

Now I think we\u2019re on our third month of 2 million Myprotein units. Into retail in a month for three consecutive months. I know it\u2019s certainly two. I\u2019m expecting the third month when I see the data to come through with the same as well. The sellout is a bit different, but obviously we\u2019re interested in the selling just as much,were 2 million units just in protein. Yogurts under the M\u00fcller partnership. That gives you an idea of the extent of the touch points that we have in that. If you were to look at Iceland as a retailer, we\u2019re probably doing in the region of about \u00a370 million a year of frozen meals with Iceland across two different types of ranges that we have with them. Now the average meal is somewhere in the region of about \u00a33.50. I think given all the average product, there are some cheaper products than that they sell. You get an idea there. There\u2019s, you know, \u00a320 million of products probably going out the door just in frozen foods and that\u2019s pretty much limited to Iceland. There are some other distribution points, but it\u2019s very successful for them. They do control distribution of that and they do have an exclusive on that range of products in there.",

          "content": "Positive feedback on the partnership 1. A powerful strategic fit Greencore Group plc is one of the UK\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s largest convenience food producers \u2014 supplying sandwiches, wraps, ready meals and other chilled products. It\u2019s also the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. So partnering with them gives Myprotein instant credibility and best-in-class manufacturing, distribution and category expertise. For Greencore, working with the UK\u2019s biggest sports nutrition brand positions them at the heart of the high-growth, high-protein convenience market rather than just traditional sandwiches. 2. Major retail validation Launching in 500+ Sainsbury\u2019s stores and inside the meal deal space is a huge achievement. Meal deals drive some of the highest footfall and repeat purchase in UK grocery \u2014 this puts Myprotein in front of millions of mainstream consumers, not just gym enthusiasts. 3. Category expansion done the right way Moving from powders and supplements into fresh, ready-to-eat food is a bold step. Doing it via Greencore shows a smart, asset-light strategy: leverage an expert partner instead of building complex chilled manufacturing in-house. 4. Products that match consumer trends Up to 28g protein, <376 calories, strong flavours like Firecracker and Teriyaki \u2014 this hits exactly what shoppers want: Healthier Convenience, High protein,Great taste with no \u201cdiet food\u201d compromise Perfect for the growing audience of hybrid workers and time-poor consumers. 5. Growth runway for both sides The post confirms this is just phase one, with broader UK distribution planned later in the year. That gives Greencore: incremental volumes,higher-value branded production, deeper relationship with THG/Myprotein And gives Myprotein a bridge from online dominance into offline everyday consumption.. Well done, THG this is a great deal",

THG Q4 Earnings Call \u201cStrong Return to Growth\u201d \u2013 Or Just Easy Comparatives? \u2022\tThe 7% Q4 growth is viewed by critics as largely a function of easy prior-year comparisons, following multiple years of contraction rather than a true acceleration. \u2022\tForum users note that management has repeatedly talked up \u201cstrong H2 momentum\u201d in previous years, only for growth to fade again. \u2022\tThe claim that H2 came 14% ahead of guidance is treated with scepticism, as THG has a long history of guidance resets, lowered bars, and selective framing. \u2022\t\u201cBroad-based growth\u201d is questioned, with bears arguing that growth is uneven and still dependent on promotions and discounting, not organic demand strength. \u2e3b Beauty \u201cExceptional\u201d \u2013 But at What Cost? \u2022\tThe 6.4% Q4 beauty growth is seen as underwhelming relative to the amount of marketing spend and discounting required to achieve it. \u2022\tCritics on LSE highlight that growth in Lookfantastic UK & Ireland (+16.2%) likely reflects: \u2022\tHeavy promotional activity \u2022\tLoyalty incentives that compress margins \u2022\tPull-forward demand rather than sustainable expansion \u2022\tRecord retention and higher spend per customer are viewed cautiously, with posters noting: \u2022\tLoyalty schemes often mask churn by subsidising repeat purchases \u2022\tIncreased spend may be inflation-driven, not volume-led \u2022\tTikTok and social-driven trends are considered highly fickle, with little moat and rapid reversals in consumer behaviour. \u2e3b Offline Beauty Stores \u2013 High Risk, Low Proof \u2022\tThe Altrincham store being \u201cahead of expectations\u201d is dismissed by sceptics as: \u2022\tA single data point \u2022\tLocated in an affluent catchment area unlikely to be representative \u2022\tProfitability claims are questioned due to: \u2022\tLack of disclosed store-level economics \u2022\tNo clarity on rent, staffing, or capex assumptions \u2022\tThe so-called \u201chalo effect\u201d is viewed as unquantified marketing spin, something THG has frequently cited without hard evidence. \u2022\tBears argue store expansion introduces: \u2022\tFixed costs \u2022\tExecution risk \u2022\tA move away from the asset-light e-commerce model THG once sold investors \u2e3b Nutrition Growth \u2013 Margin Pressure Still the Elephant in the Room \u2022\t8.5% Q4 growth in Nutrition is viewed as modest given the category\u2019s historical growth rates. \u2022\tClaims of Myprotein being the \u201cworld\u2019s number one\u201d brand are criticised as: \u2022\tMarketing language without independently verifiable metrics \u2022\tUS retail listings (GNC, Kroger) are seen as: \u2022\tLower-margin wholesale channels \u2022\tLikely to dilute brand positioning and profitability \u2022\tElevated whey prices are not dismissed as \u201ctemporary\u201d by critics, who argue: \u2022\tStructural protein demand + geopolitics = permanently higher input costs \u2022\tTHG lacks sufficient pricing power to fully pass these through \u2022\tActivewear growth is viewed as: \u2022\tA crowded, low-loyalty category \u2022\tHistorically poor margin territory for DTC bran",

Strong Return to Growth * Q4 revenue grew 7%, driven by a very strong second half. * H2 performance came in **14% ahead of the top end of guidance, highlighting improving execution. * Growth was broad-based across core divisions. Beauty Performing Exceptionally Well * THG Beauty grew 6.4% in Q4, well ahead of expectations. * Lookfantastic UK & Ireland delivered **16.2% growth**, supported by: * Record customer retention * Growing loyalty membership * Higher spend per customer * Management highlighted strong momentum in devices, apps, loyalty schemes and social-driven beauty trends (including TikTok influence). Offline beauty is also proving successful: * The first Lookfantastic store in Altrincham has traded significantly ahead of expectations. * The store is profitable **and** delivering a measurable online \u201chalo effect\u201d. * Additional stores are planned, using a disciplined, brand-partnered rollout strategy. Nutrition Continues to Grow * THG Nutrition grew 8.5% in Q4. * Myprotein remains the world\u2019s number one sports nutrition brand. * Offline expansion continues, with new U.S. listings at major retailers including GNC and Kroger launching in H1 2026. While whey prices remain elevated, management stressed: * Global protein demand is at record levels * Commodity cycles are temporary * The long-term market opportunity has significantly expanded High-margin categories such as activewear are growing strongly and are expected to exceed **15% of Myprotein revenue mix in 2026**. Business Simplification Largely Complete * Portfolio optimisation in beauty (exiting lower-return regions) is now largely annualised. * Non-core asset disposals and operational streamlining are complete. * This sets up **cleaner comparisons and improved efficiency** going into 2026. Confident Outlook for 2026 Management repeatedly emphasized confidence in trading momentum: * Expected **FY26 EBITDA around \u00a3100m** * Forecast **\u00a320\u201325m of free cash flow** * Continued investment in marketing to support sustainable long-term growth * Increased use of AI and personalization tools across beauty CEO Matthew Moulding stated the group enters 2026 with significant momentum and a stronger, more focused operating model. VAT Upside Optionality * THG is awaiting the outcome of HMRC\u2019s final appeal attempt. * Potential VAT repayment has grown to approximately \u00a355m. * Management has taken a prudent approach, continuing to pay VAT while the case concludes. * Any successful outcome would represent a material cash inflow for the group.",

But every quarter rolls in like a busted-down truck, Numbers keep on missin\u2019 and the margins just\u2026 suck. \ud83c\udfb6 Chorus Oh it\u2019s profits on the promise, but losses in the books, Every update\u2019s thinner than a Nashville bar\u2019s free looks. They keep sayin\u2019 \u201cnext quarter,\u201d yeah, I\u2019ve heard that song before, At THG headquarters by the never-profit door. Now you gotta tip your hat where the credit\u2019s due, Matthew Moulding\u2019s drivin\u2019, yeah he\u2019s seen it through\u2014 Seen it through the mud and straight into the red, With big bold visions and the shareholders misled. He talks scale and strategy, platforms built to fly, But the earnings call comes round and the guidance starts to cry. It\u2019s ambition on a billboard, execution on a slide, And the share price just keeps lookin\u2019 for a place to hide. \ud83c\udfb6 Chorus Oh it\u2019s profits on the promise, but losses in the books, Every update\u2019s thinner than a Nashville bar\u2019s free looks.

So play it soft on the fiddle, play it sad on the steel, For investors still hopin\u2019 it\u2019ll someday turn real. \u2018Til then we\u2019ll read the updates with a stiff drink in hand, Singin\u2019 \u201cone day soon\u201d\u2026 like a long-lost country band.",

Ryder added: \u2018So there's a shift in how consumers are socialising now, and it is more towards health and wellness. They're literally ditching pubs and bars for gyms and running clubs.'",

John, you\u2019re right that the sportswear category is seeing exceptional growth and also really strong margin progression as well. To such an extent, it\u2019s quite quickly becoming our highest gross profit category. At this rate, it\u2019s right up there pushing the likes of vitamins, which is a very high gross profit margin. It\u2019s a deliberate strategy that we\u2019re building upon where obviously Whey protein as a core category remains super important for the consumer, but it\u2019s one of the lower margin categories, especially when you consider potential for whey volatility. There are a number of ways we\u2019ve been tackling that over the past couple of years, and clothing is one of those. The bitumen build out is another. The offline partnerships, the licensing as well, is really key.",

Now I think we\u2019re on our third month of 2 million Myprotein units. Into retail in a month for three consecutive months. I know it\u2019s certainly two. I\u2019m expecting the third month when I see the data to come through with the same as well. The sellout is a bit different, but obviously we\u2019re interested in the selling just as much,were 2 million units just in protein. Yogurts under the M\u00fcller partnership. That gives you an idea of the extent of the touch points that we have in that. If you were to look at Iceland as a retailer, we\u2019re probably doing in the region of about \u00a370 million a year of frozen meals with Iceland across two different types of ranges that we have with them. Now the average meal is somewhere in the region of about \u00a33.50. I think given all the average product, there are some cheaper products than that they sell. You get an idea there. There\u2019s, you know, \u00a320 million of products probably going out the door just in frozen foods and that\u2019s pretty much limited to Iceland. There are some other distribution points, but it\u2019s very successful for them. They do control distribution of that and they do have an exclusive on that range of products in there.",

          "content": "Positive feedback on the partnership 1. A powerful strategic fit Greencore Group plc is one of the UK\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s largest convenience food producers \u2014 supplying sandwiches, wraps, ready meals and other chilled products. It\u2019s also the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. So partnering with them gives Myprotein instant credibility and best-in-class manufacturing, distribution and category expertise. For Greencore, working with the UK\u2019s biggest sports nutrition brand positions them at the heart of the high-growth, high-protein convenience market rather than just traditional sandwiches. 2. Major retail validation Launching in 500+ Sainsbury\u2019s stores and inside the meal deal space is a huge achievement. Meal deals drive some of the highest footfall and repeat purchase in UK grocery \u2014 this puts Myprotein in front of millions of mainstream consumers, not just gym enthusiasts. 3. Category expansion done the right way Moving from powders and supplements into fresh, ready-to-eat food is a bold step. Doing it via Greencore shows a smart, asset-light strategy: leverage an expert partner instead of building complex chilled manufacturing in-house. 4. Products that match consumer trends Up to 28g protein, <376 calories, strong flavours like Firecracker and Teriyaki \u2014 this hits exactly what shoppers want: Healthier Convenience, High protein,Great taste with no \u201cdiet food\u201d compromise Perfect for the growing audience of hybrid workers and time-poor consumers. 5. Growth runway for both sides The post confirms this is just phase one, with broader UK distribution planned later in the year. That gives Greencore: incremental volumes,higher-value branded production, deeper relationship with THG/Myprotein And gives Myprotein a bridge from online dominance into offline everyday consumption.. Well done, THG this is a great deal",

I have worked with retailers you when have been asked to accept increases, have either said no or just removed off the shelf. This is where Matt is putting all bets on whey as their prices will stay the same agreed (hopefully) and then profit will flow in. Cannot see him putting up prices unless it is part of the deal to get in the door and review return sales. \ud83d\udcaf Matt needs to sell an asset and give something back to shareholders. I\u2019m one third of the business down and more shares in the pot than before. For nothing Again Matt, if you are on here. Give something back that we all deserve. Sale, divi from tax money back, share buy back to help or Matt and our mute chairman to admit failings and sort themselves out. Any of these, shorts will start to take their money and bully another share. It is plainly obvious to even the amateur investor.

Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples, often in the 1.5x - 3x revenue range. If THG decided to sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. That is more than double the MC of Warpaint at its lower end valuation.

          "content": "Stan, you\u2019re trying to compare two businesses that are structured in completely different ways. APN is a focused retailer with a narrow product set, whereas THG is an integrated global platform that is home to 2 powerhouses: Beauty & Nutrition. Lumping all of THG\u2019s \u00a31.7bn revenue against APN\u2019s \u00a3105m and expecting the same margin profile simply isn\u2019t a like-for-like comparison. Over \u00a31.1bn of THG revenue comes from Beauty, a category with very different margin dynamics to protein powders, and nothing to do with whey input costs. THG also owns assets APN doesn\u2019t. Capex has already fallen sharply post-demerger and net debt is down materially, which shows the model is moving in the right direction. APN making \u00a330m on \u00a3105m sales is great, but it operates a far simpler model with far less infrastructure. THG is building a global brand and that inevitably distorts short-term P&L versus a pure retailer. As cash flow turns positive in 2026, the operating leverage will start to show. An audit wouldn\u2019t magically strip out \u00a3150m \u2013 most of those costs support owned assets and capabilities APN simply doesn\u2019t have. Compare the right segments on a like-for-like basis and the picture looks very different. And guess what -  MyProtein in its infancy was making \u00a330M on \u00a3100M revenue Lastly, what happened to 'It's not THG's fault, it's the fault of the Hedge Funds' we had 100s of those posts from you last year - have you flipped :) Stanleyb Posted in: THG Posts: 3,836 Fines, fines, fines...28 Oct 2025 10:24 Fines, fines, fines..!!!

Many of the things you quote are right up there with that all time favourite \u201cabout to sign a whale \u201c, or MM\u2019s latest hit, \u201cRemain I can pay a 12% dividend\u201d.

So there are more shares than before and a third less of the business. That my colleagues is painful in any explanation. Let\u2019s hope that Matt is getting tired of the city foot on his head and allows him to boot the chairman and take his place. No matter how it is spinned, we need fresh management blood, performance based target on profitability. I do believe ingenuity is sapping the life out of THG, why would others use it. I believe he took as much of it out before demerger and is betting on market share to support growth then profit. Would the supermarkets be willing to pay extra and they still have the counter space??? Hence everything just hinge on whey reduction for now.",

At that time, the deal was at roughly 1.8\u00d7 forward revenue and added significant US beauty sales to THG\u2019s portfolio. Given that Dermstore has probably grown its revenue and profit since it was purchased, a buyer is likely to pay a higher valuation multiple than what Target did, especially if Dermstore is now more profitable or has stronger market positioning. Link to strong market positioning: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wearethg_wearethg-activity-7422688274114072576-uv3b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADGjivYBi98_Kr0ghVvJn-kmg4bPEKZKahI Online beauty and skincare marketplaces can trade at high revenue multiples (depending on growth/EBITDA), often in the 1.5\u00d7\u20133\u00d7 revenue range if earnings are robust and predictable. If they did sell Dermstore, a conservative price would be \u00a3350 to \u00a3500M. And here is the crazy thing, if it sold at the upper end of \u00a3500M then that is not that far from the current MC",

Flash crash downwards. Positive sentiment turns to FUD. But lets recall; Positive media after and of 3 Brokers. One Broker upgraded quickly after (Jefferies) from 55p to 60p. Another maintained 80p guidance and Lastly JPM Cazenove reiterated a Target Price of 55p. No Sell recommendations. 22 Jan 26. Extra Bonus shares listed and admitted - 40,611,605 Many querying why these were awarded, after the the poor share price performance. No real share price reaction initially - but then it falls in the days after. Possible seller? 29th Jan 26. Linkedin post by Matt Moulding. Highlighting the current state of the UK market and querying when things will be addressed. Share price falls on the day and has fallen further today. Honest Injun - No rush of buyers either at just over 37p So much so that this is the case. THG Revenue.  \u00a31.716 BILLION. Market Capitalisation: \u00a3579.49M Applied Nutrition (APN) Revenue. \u00a3107.1 MILLION Market Capitalisation: \u00a3582.5M But one, THG is generating  X 17 the revenue of APN. Significantly so. Virtually 6X also that on Nutrition. Sum of Parts of THG also far in excess. Yet they are actually valued less than APN. Then just to put things in perspective THG is actually being valued at less than the top end of the \u00a3400M to \u00a3600M speculative preliminary conditional offer that Selkirk Group made for THG Nutrition alone.  Meaning THG Beauty a \u00a31.1 Billion Revenue generator consisting of multiple businesses and Brands is effectively valued for FREE. https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SELK/response-to-statement-by-thg-plc-e3rw7vvgabgzb48.html Not wishing to be impertinent but yes you can blame the market but seriously any company you would expect also to look inward and to have a full scrum down, thorough review, dissection and implement improvement measures if necessary. For instance: Do we need to have Analyst meetings tagged to Trading updates when others don't bother. RNS Content the same - taking lessons out of others RNS with favourable reaction. Best practice. Might less be more. (See BOO, See APN and countless others). Participants if we do - do all contribute, are they media trained or media competent? Are these Linkedin postings actually benefiting group shareholders? Virtually every time these are posted then the share price goes down. Also why no Investor Relations engagement with shareholders. Might this not help resolve issues, FUD and misinformation. Then perhaps the biggest question. Is the share price ever going to recover to meaningful value and get out of this constancy of rise and fall with the present CEO, BoD, Strategy? Does it need a reshuffling or refreshing? My thoughts only. Enjoy your weekends.",

I don't know why but I think I will just keep adding if it keeps dropping.

And if it does I cannot see the reason why the SP should not reach \u00a31+. I have been a holder of CURRYs for a very long time because I was always in red. but held it until last year and sold out.

That, and no doubt helped along the way by those setting the price and those who benefit from churning volume, for incredibly the market price setting must have this now about Absolute Parity with APN in terms of Market Cap. The difference last night was only a mere \u00a320 million. Absolutely astonishing really that both have similar market caps, when one (THG) generates \u00a31.7Billion of Revenue against the others (APN) only just over \u00a3100 Million of Revenue, a difference of a Factor 17 - and THG has a Beauty division completely distinct from Nutrition and generating about \u00a31.1 Billion revenues. Yes one might have Profit and the other not,  but then again one also has \u00a355million sat in a pending  VAT refund, and the other probably hasn't. Just read the Linkedin post from last night and sorry to say it, but it's not how to win friends and influence people. That said  are you just meant to sit silent and watch whilst you're share price gets car crashed back and forward so some hedge fund or funds make \u00a3100's of millions through manipulation and by devaluing your share prices, - when the actual update actually read quite well. And was now over 2 weeks ago (13th Jan). Rightfully imo he does ask When? is something actually going to be done about this, as it's detrimental to the London Stock Exchange and AIM, with net withdrawals and no new listings. Maybe from a shareholder perspective, and years of this, you have to ask if this is being  targeted due to one or more Individuals at the top and actually in the longer term interests of shareholders is it not time to be looking at making some changes. Shame really for it was actually starting to look and trade like a FTSE 250 company, with a relatively stable share price and tight'ish range. Never moan though at the price that's presented to you. Might go cheaper still, might go higher. Staged entry always the better strategy imvho. Each decides their own respective strategy. Just my take on things.",

Everyone knew THG was discounting to bring up subscriptions, raise brand profile and such. So it is no surprise as far as I am concerned that EBITDA was maintained as forecast. The fact is they sold more, maybe got more subscriptions and brand awareness. More people sampling the brands and thus securing more growth which will help when they start to unwind the deals a little bit.",

I bet many must juts sell straight away and maybe that is Matt\u2019s plan. He knows his staff can see the SP keep dropping so they will sell as soon as shares land. He probably counts on that as means to drive the share price lower.  Rinse repeat and keep the company out of profit until he can miraculously rescue it and take private.",

THG IMHO will make profits and will eventually pay a dividend. That is why I am here, I am here for the long haul and will continue to buy when I can and post facts when I see them.  A lot of my posts get deleted, mostly the ones with factual links. Take from that what you will. This is one of the reasons why I don't post as often as I used to.  The very same posters who are ripping into MM now are the same posters who were screaming don't take up the allocation. Ingenuity is worthless. How wrong they were on that one, and how wrong they will be in the very near future about THG's profitability. Good Luck, One All TTFN  :)",

I'm not asking for anyone to short this, or sell their shares or for a riot to start between us. All I'm asking is ask more, demand more. Ask more of MM, and IR team. Demand more proof, insights. Lets stick up for what we worth as together we have a lot of share percentage so lets unite in stopping any shadiness, preventing more of it and lets stick together and demand more light on stuff. That can only be a good thing right. This is still undervalued that is a certainty, but it could also be taken away from us at an even greater loss.

THG Nutrition is multi-brand, DTC-led, global, returns-heavy, and marketing-intensive. They do not have the same cost structure \u2014 whey price is only one input. You can\u2019t isolate a margin gap and label it the Ingenuity tax. 2 Related-party payments are not theft \u2014 they\u2019re disclosed, audited, and priced under transfer-pricing rules The MSA was approved by the board, reviewed by auditors, and disclosed in full. If fees were inflated, auditors and regulators would not allow them. Related-party transactions,  value extraction \u2014 they exist in almost every demerged structure. 3 The tech wasn\u2019t given away, Ingenuity was moved so it could be valued, sold, or partnered independently. That\u2019s exactly what investors had been demanding for years. THG still has full contractual access \u2014 nothing was lost. 4 Debt staying with RemainCo is normal in demergers Debt follows cash-generating businesses (Nutrition & Beauty). That\u2019s standard corporate finance, not a dump. Bottom line: There is zero evidence of theft, only a standard demerger structure that the market may or may not like.  If this were a screw job, it would not have been signed off on by the auditors, regulators, banks, and major shareholders. Without actual proof, this is noise with an agenda. The share price is being manipulated of that there is no doubt. Everybody knows it.",

Look at the \"Average number of employees\" note. The Trend: You will likely see the headcount at THG Public drop significantly (as tech/warehouse staff moved to Ingenuity). The \"Screw Job\": Even though the staff are gone, the \"Distribution Costs\" line item on the Income Statement didn't drop by the same amount. Instead, the cost just changed names from \"Wages\" to \"Service Fees.\" You are paying the same (or more) for staff you no longer employ or control. Summary: The Single Chart to Look For If you only look at one thing, find the \"Segmental Adjusted EBITDA\" chart in the H1 2025 presentation. Visual Proof: You will see a bar for THG Nutrition that is tiny compared to 2 years ago. Ask yourself: \"Did people stop eating protein?\" No (see Applied Nutrition). \"Did the warehouse get more expensive?\" Yes.",

Here is your \"Do It Yourself\" Audit Kit to prove THG Public (You) is being drained by Ingenuity Private (Moulding). PROOF #1: The \"Same Ingredients, Different Profit\" Test The Document: THG Interim Results H1 2025 (Released Sept 2025) vs. Applied Nutrition FY25 Results (Released Nov 2025). The Test: Both companies buy the exact same raw material (Whey Protein). Both sell to the same customers. Go to THG\u2019s H1 2025 Report: Look for the Segmental Breakdown table. Find: THG Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it collapsed to ~3.9%. (Management blamed \"high whey prices\"). Go to Applied Nutrition\u2019s FY25 Report: Look for the Financial Highlights page. Find: EBITDA Margin. The Number: You will see it sits at ~30%. The Conclusion: If \"high whey prices\" were the real problem, Applied Nutrition would have crashed too. They didn't. The ~26% difference is almost entirely the \"Ingenuity Tax\"\u2014the inflated fees THG Nutrition is forced to pay for warehousing and tech. PROOF #2: The \"Related Party\" Leak The Document: THG Demerger Circular (Published Nov 2024) or the H1 2025 Financial Statements. The Test: Find the money leaving the building. Go to the \"Related Party Transactions\" Note: This is usually Note 18 or similar in the back of the accounts. Find: \"Amounts payable to THG Ingenuity.\" The Number: In 2024/2025, this figure runs into the hundreds of millions. The \"Kick in the Teeth\": Look for the \"Master Services Agreement (MSA)\" terms in the Demerger Circular. It explicitly states the contract is for 10 years. This proves you are legally locked into paying these fees until ~2035, regardless of whether you make a profit. PROOF #3: The \"Debt Dump\" The Document: THG H1 2025 Balance Sheet. The Test: Who kept the mortgage, and who got the house? Look at \"Net Debt\": You will see THG Public (RemainCo) holds roughly \u00a3321 million in net debt. Look at \"Intangible Assets\": You will see a massive drop because the proprietary technology (the \"Ingenuity Platform\" IP) was transferred to the Private Company. The Conclusion: The Public Company kept the debt (the burden) but gave away the tech assets (the potential growth). You are now paying rent to use the technology you used to own, while still paying off the bank loans used to build it.",

Look, as you would expect, since we\u2019ve announced the sale of Claremont, there\u2019s obviously a lot of interest in the background as to some of our other manufacturing assets in particular and the performances of that. It would be fair to say we\u2019ve had formal approaches on some of those assets. We\u2019re pretty clear as to how we stand on these things, which is the private market valuations, as we saw with Claremont, are robust. If we receive interest in an asset where we believe we can make a deal work for us without in any way negatively impacting the existing business models of either nutrition or beauty, then sure, we will entertain that and know and derive a fair valuation for one of those assets, especially if it\u2019s of a material value. If it\u2019s something that\u2019s like with Claremont, it was \u00a3100 million plus consideration, then sure, we would do that, especially given the valuations that are on, you know, of THG and the wider PLC market today. I think that\u2019s probably as deep as I should go into that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty frank and open to say, look, we could quite readily put an RNS out at any point to say we\u2019ve done a transaction. It would be something that\u2019s relatively non-core at a fair market value that delivers something that we\u2019re pretty pleased with. How long will that be before we do that? Who knows? It will depend on achieving the right price points, if those prices arrive. That\u2019s probably as much as I can say right now.",

Coke backed Monster ten years ago with a $2bn investment for a 17% holding. That $2bn represented less than 1% of Coke\u2019s value. Monster has revenues of \u00a35.6bn, a market cap of \u00a348.1bn with small debt giving an EV/Sales of 8.6x. Monster\u2019s share price is up 40x over 20 years. Coke\u2019s $2bn investment is now worth around $8bn, driven by Monster\u2019s push through Coke\u2019s distribution network. Celsius, the US-listed health drink, offers a similar story. Pepsi is an 11% shareholder and global distribution partner. Pepsi bought into Celsius in 2022 and in August 2025 with another $500m. Pepsi has invested over $1bn for its 11% stake which is less than 1% of its mkt cap. Celsius\u2019s mkt cap is \u00a311.1bn with revenue of \u00a31.0bn last year being an 11x sales multiple. Its share price is up c.30x in just five years. Lotus Bakeries, the Dutch-listed food business behind Lotus Biscoff, shows that you don\u2019t need to be Coke-sized to achieve strong valuations. Its health division includes Trek and Nak\u2019d bars, both acquired over the past five years. Lotus has a mkt cap of \u00a35.7bn with small debt with \u00a31.1bn revenue in 2024 and trades on an EV/Sales of 5.4x. Fevertree, a UK stock partnered with Molson in January 2025 which invested \u00a370m for an 8.5% stake (around 1% of Molson\u2019s mkt cap). Fevertree has sales of \u00a3360m last year and a mkt cap of \u00a31bn, giving EV/Sales of 2.7x. Molson has the capability to significantly accelerate Fevertree\u2019s growth. As for THG, its mkt cap is \u00a3540m with \u00a3200m net debt, giving an EV of \u00a3740m. Total sales post-demerger last year were \u00a31.7bn, of which \u00a3580m came from THG Nutrition (MyProtein) and the balance from THG Beauty. If we split value 50/50, MyProtein trades on c. 0.6x sales. MyProtein appears to be on the radar screen of several global brands such as Muller and the new unnamed global confectioner who appear to want to work with them on product development.",

Naturally, confidentiality agreements between parties would prevent any disclosure of such terms. What would Holland & Barret say, by comparison, if they found out THG Beauty and THG Nutrition were receiving a 30% discount on their fulfilment services? MM has publicly said he has been holding prices. Couple this with the Whey and Yen headwinds, and of course, this will affect profits!! This is all in the public domain.

To signal that a sustained upward trend has begun, technical analysis suggests THG (The Hut Group) needs to clear several immediate resistance levels on Thursday, January 22, 2026. First Resistance (R1): A close above 41.92p is the most immediate hurdle to overcome current pivot point resistance. Key Short-Term Barrier: To confirm a break from its current \"Strong Sell\" technical status, it needs to close above its 5-day moving average of 42.01p. Trend Confirmation: Technical analysts often look for a close above the 20-day moving average, currently at 42.75p, to indicate a shift in short-term momentum from bearish to bullish. Significant Recovery Level: A close above 44.10p (the 50-day moving average) would provide a much stronger signal that the medium-term downward pressure is easing. Despite current technical weakness, analyst consensus remains a \"Moderate Buy\" with a median 12-month price target of 46.00p to 55.00p, representing potential upside of over 23% from the January 21 close of 41.68p. Summary: While technical analysis suggests a \"Strong Sell\" or weak short-term momentum, the underlying business is showing signs of stabilizing, with some analysts noting long-term potential.",

My company's share price has also fallen since I've been collecting my free shares therefore selling them would result in getting less money then the bonus award was meant to be. I also have a sharesave scheme were you pay for the shares but also have to wait 3 years. It is risk free as you don't have to excersice the option to buy if the SP is below your buy in price.

A look at the chart though shows that just about the time the LTIP options were granted in 2022 the share price had fallen off a cliff from 700p and was sat somewhere between 200p and 100p approx. So the LTIP was probably implemented to incentivise and to get the share price back up. It hasn't and now that they have the physical shares in hand, rather than realising between 100p and 200p and higher, they are now worth a salutory 42p. Great if you are averaging down from a holding at a higher level but given the dismal share price the recipients haven't got what they thought they would be getting value wise and if the want those levels again then the hard reality is that it has to be earned.",

How the World Cup (and major sports events) benefits THG/Myprotein: Increased Sales: Major tournaments boost global interest in fitness and nutrition, leading more people to buy protein supplements and related products for muscle recovery and performance. Market Expansion: Partnerships and increased visibility during big events help Myprotein reach wider audiences in new markets, says City AM. Brand Recognition: Being associated with elite sports elevates Myprotein's brand as a go-to for serious athletes and fitness fans. Product Innovation: Demand encourages development of new products, like their animal-free whey, catering to different dietary needs and sustainability concerns, notes Perfect Day. Myprotein's Role & Products: Quality & Differentiation: City AM notes Myprotein differentiates itself with quality, good pricing, and innovative products like protein pancakes and diet whey. Athlete Support: Products like Impact Whey provide essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for muscle repair and growth. Convenience: Products like protein pancake mixes and convenient shakes offer easy ways to meet protein goals. In essence, the global excitement around the World Cup fuels the health and wellness trend, directly benefiting companies like THG and its Myprotein brand by increasing demand for their high-quality, innovative protein solutions.",
