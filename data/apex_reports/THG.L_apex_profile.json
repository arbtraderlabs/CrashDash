The collaboration will introduce a new range of Myprotein branded food on-the-go items, significantly expanding the brand's presence in offline retail channels and continuing its successful 6 aisle strategy of launching new licensing agreements with best-in-class partners.\nThe range will include protein-enriched salads and wraps, with scope to expand into other profiles and formats, helping consumers access convenient, nutritious meals that align with their fitness and healthy lifestyle goals. These products will be available in Sainsbury's supermarkets and convenience stores.\nThe Greencore partnership forms part of Myprotein's wider strategic ambition to grow its offline and licensing footprint to 100,000 doors, allowing for deeper penetration with existing retail partners and accelerated expansion within the convenience channel. Food-to-go represents a high-frequency, high-visibility consumption occasion that complements Myprotein's existing protein portfolio, covering powders, dairy and desserts, bars and snacks and ready-to-drink, broadening consumer touchpoints beyond the gym and home.\nLicensing agreements with category leaders including M\u00fcller, Iceland and Jimmy's Coffee, led to sales of over 43 million Myprotein units into retail during 2025. This strategy leverages its global brand recognition alongside specialised manufacturing and distribution expertise.\nNeil Mistry, CEO of THG Nutrition, commented:\n\"This collaboration is another step in Myprotein's global leadership across sports nutrition, adding Greencore's expertise in creating and distributing fresh, on-the-go food to our growing list of partners.\n\"The range builds on the demand of GLP-1 consumers, along with trends towards cleaner nutrition combined with protein-rich foods and snacks. This partnership not only widens the reach of the Myprotein brand offering, it brings further significant penetration into offline channels.\n\"Following a strong start to the year across our licensed ranges, we expect to significantly build on last year's performance, with the brand on target to sell-in over 60 million licensed products in 2026, up from 43 million in 2025.\"\nAndy Parton, Chief Commercial Officer of Greencore, commented:\n\"We're thrilled to partner with Myprotein to bring high\n\u2011\nquality, protein\n\u2011\nrich food\n\u2011\nto\n\u2011\ngo options to consumers across the UK. As demand grows for convenient, nutritious products that support healthier lifestyles, this collaboration allows us to combine Greencore's expertise in fresh, ready\n\u2011\nto\n\u2011\neat food with one of the most recognisable brands in sports nutrition. We're excited about the potential of this partnership and look forward to expanding the range together.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nInvestor enquiries - THG PLC\nKate Grimoldby, Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Projects\nInvestor.relations@thg.com\nMedia enquiries:\nSodali & Co - Financial PR adviser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7100 6451\nRuss Lynch/Sam Austrums/Louisa Henry\nthg@sodali.com\nTHG PLC\nmedia-enquiries@thg.com\nNotes to Editors\nTHG PLC is a global e-commerce group and brand owner headquartered in Manchester, UK, which operates through two leading consumer businesses: THG Beauty and THG Nutrition.\nTHG Beauty operates prominent online platforms including Lookfantastic, Dermstore and Cult Beauty, offering a valued route to market for over 1,000 third-party brands, alongside a specialist portfolio of owned brands.\nTHG Nutrition, led by Myprotein, the world's largest online sports nutrition brand, spans multiple health and wellness categories, delivering its products both directly to consumers and through strategic offline partnerships worldwide.\nEnds\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.
