As a result, the Ordinary share NAV moved largely in line with the movement in the Scancell share price during the quarter. The Company was presented with an opportunity to de-risk the concentration of the holding for Ordinary shareholders and was able to achieve a profitable exit of c.47% of the Ordinary share pool's holding as at 30 June 2025. Seneca was able to realise \u00a3435k in proceeds from the disposal, which generated a profit of \u00a3172k, resulting in an average weighted return of 1.7x on original investment cost. This disposal has enabled the Company to declare a second interim capital dividend of 5.0p per Ordinary share.\nThe Ordinary share pool's unquoted investments have all previously been written down to \u00a3nil carrying value. The valuations of the Ordinary share pool's unquoted investments remain unchanged as at the quarter end.\nSecond Interim Capital Dividend on Ordinary Shares\nThe Directors of\nthe Company\nare pleased to declare an interim capital dividend of 5.0 pence per Ordinary Share for the year to 31 December 2025, to be paid on 7 November 2025.\nThe ex-dividend date is 23 October 2025.\nThe record date for the dividend is 24 October 2025.\nThe dividend payment date is 7 November 2025.\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulation No 596/2014 which is part of English Law by virtue of the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.
