As the client prepares to initiate their clinical trial, this latest contract reflects a continued commitment to support the project throughout the execution of the Phase 2 study. Due to timelines associated with patient recruitment and data generation, this project is not anticipated to commence until 2027. The extended period between contract signature and project commencement is attributable to the client's desire to secure key service providers before initiating the trial. Upon initiation, the project is expected to run for approximately six months and due to flexibility in the scope of work has a value between \u00a3116K and \u00a3169K.\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO of Physiomics, commented:\n\"We are thrilled to have been awarded this new contract and to have the opportunity to continue supporting our client through their Phase 2 trial. This offers Physiomics an excellent chance to provide valuable insights that could guide the development of this Rheumatoid Arthritis asset, while also allowing us to begin expanding our project pipeline for the next financial year.\"\nFor more information about Physiomics and its services, please visit\nwww.physiomics.co.uk\n.\nEnquiries:\nPhysiomics plc\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO\n+44 (0)1235 841575\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\n+44 (0) 203 764 2341\nStrand Hanson Ltd (NOMAD)\nJames Dance & James Bellman\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nNotes to Editor\nAbout Physiomics\nPhysiomics plc combines expertise across Modelling & Simulation, Biostatistics, Data Science and Bioinformatics, together with deep biology expertise, to help biotech and pharma companies streamline their drug development journeys.
