As the client prepares to initiate their clinical trial, this latest contract reflects a continued commitment to support the project throughout the execution of the Phase 2 study. Due to timelines associated with patient recruitment and data generation, this project is not anticipated to commence until 2027. The extended period between contract signature and project commencement is attributable to the client's desire to secure key service providers before initiating the trial. Upon initiation, the project is expected to run for approximately six months and due to flexibility in the scope of work has a value between \u00a3116K and \u00a3169K.\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO of Physiomics, commented:\n\"We are thrilled to have been awarded this new contract and to have the opportunity to continue supporting our client through their Phase 2 trial.

When compared to the year ended 30 June 2024 (FY24), these unaudited numbers would represent an increase in Total Income of approximately 46% and a reduction in Loss after Tax of approximately 31%, reflecting the positive growth trajectory of the business and effective cost management.\nThe Company continues to build its pipeline with the average total value of contract wins over FY24 and FY25 reaching a record high of over \u00a31m per year, a 63% increase on the yearly average over the previous five years.

We are therefore confident that further revenue growth can be achieved in FY26.\nIn addition, the Company expects that \u00a360k worth of Grant Income will be recognised in FY26.\nThe Company is also generating momentum across its key growth initiatives:\n- Biometrics service line: June 2025 announcement of the Company's first two Biometrics contracts worth \u00a3111k and recruitment of Head of Biometrics, Jesse Thissen\n- Diversification of client base: 31% of all contract awards in FY25 were from new clients, compared to 17% over the prior six years.\n- Expansion into new therapeutic areas: 50% of projects delivered in FY25 were in therapeutic areas outside oncology, compared to an average of 5% over the previous three years\n- Personalised Medicine - Recently announced expanded relationship with DoseMe Inc and Implementation of the Company's Dosing software onto the DoseMeRx Platform, and progress of the PREDICT-ONC trial.\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO of Physiomics, commented:\n\"I am thrilled that the changes we've made here at Physiomics are starting to have a positive effect on the Company's performance.

          "full_content": "10 Jul 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 4426Q\nPhysiomics PLC\n10 July 2025\n10 July 2025\nPhysiomics plc\n(\"Physiomics\" or the \"Company\")\nPhysiomics Implements Personalised Dosing Software onto the DoseMeRx Platform and expands partnership with DoseMe\nPhysiomics plc (AIM: PYC), a leading mathematical modelling, data science and biostatistics company supporting the development of new therapeutics and personalised medicine solutions, is pleased to announce the implementation of the Company's personalised dosing software onto the DoseMeRx platform and the expansion of its partnership with DoseMe to support the development of new dosing solutions.\nFollowing several iterations of software deployment, evaluation and debugging, the Company has successfully implemented its dosing software onto DoseMe's latest platform. This now allows the tool to be made available to clinicians and health care providers on a research-only basis allowing for important human factor evaluation and additional validation data to be generated.\nIn addition, Physiomics and DoseMe have agreed non-binding Heads of Terms with the intention of expanding their partnership beyond the Company's current personalised dosing software.\nBackground\nThe Company's personalised dosing software has been developed primarily with grant funding from UK bodies, including \u00a368,000 from Innovate UK (March 2018), \u00a3150,000 from the National Institute for Health and Care Research to fund the PARTNER study (March 2020), and most recently \u00a3137,376 from Innovate UK and The Office for Life Sciences to fund the PREDICT-ONC study (November 2023).\nInitially focused on supporting dosing decisions for cancer chemotherapies (such as docetaxel), a second use-case for the dosing software was identified following completion of the PARTNER study in 2023. Since chemotherapy often causes reduction of white cell counts (neutropenia), patients undergoing treatment have an elevated risk of infection and hospitalisation. In attempt to mitigate such risks, clinicians often prescribe an expensive biologic treatment called, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) which helps increase white blood cell counts. Optimising the dosing of G-CSF for each patient is crucial to minimise side-effects attributed to the therapy, whilst keeping treatment costs down. Through the PREDICT-ONC trial, the Company aims to generate additional data to further refine and validate the dosing software for use with G-CSF and docetaxel.\nDoseMe\nDoseMe is a US based leading provider of model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) software, providing clinicians worldwide 'easy-to-use', decision-support tools to guide personalized dosing. In July 2024, DoseMe announced a major update of its DoseMeRx platform, creating a new user experience with added functionality. The platform is used by clinicians and practitioners worldwide, supporting dosing decisions for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. As the largest Bayesian dosing platform in the US, with deployment across Europe, UK and further afield, the DoseMeRx platform provides Physiomics an effective route to initially deploy, but then eventually commercialise their Personalised Dosing Software. Furthermore, due to complimentary capabilities across the DoseMe and Physiomics businesses, both parties have identified the opportunities to collaborate on the development of new dosing software tools beyond GCSF and docetaxel.\nThe partnership builds on each party's core strengths, combing Physiomics' oncology and modelling expertise with DoseMe's experience in delivering dosing tools at scale, within clinical workflows.\nExpansion of collaboration\nPhysiomics and DoseMe have recently signed non-binding Heads of Terms with the intention of expanding their partnership beyond the Company's current personalised dosing software. This agreement defines terms across four areas of collaboration:\n\u00b7\ndevelopment and commercialisation of novel dosing software tools originating from Physiomics;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment and commercialisation of novel dosing software tools originating from DoseMe or its clients;\n\u00b7\nprovision of consultancy services by the Company to DoseMe; and\n\u00b7\nco-development of clinical trial dosing software in support of biopharmaceutical clients.\nThe two parties are actively working to identify potential projects falling under these umbrella categories and further announcements on this will be made when appropriate.\nNext steps\nThe implementation of the Company's personalised dosing software onto the DoseMeRx platform is an important step towards its eventual commercialisation. As next steps, the Company is focused on two main areas:\n1. Refinement and Validation: The Innovate funded clinical trial that is projected to complete early next year is starting to generate the data needed to further refine and validate the personalised dosing software. In parallel, the Company is also exploring other sources of data, either in the public domain or available at clinical sites, to accelerate th",

The business is developing anchored-drug conjugates to trigger long lasting anti-tumour responses without compromising safety. One such candidate in development by Ankyra Therapeutic is their Cytokine Class IL-12 (ANK-101) asset which has successfully entered the clinic.\nAbout\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy has revolutionised cancer treatment by harnessing the body's immune system to recognise and attack cancer cells more effectively. Unlike traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, which target both healthy and cancerous cells, immunotherapies provide a more precise and potentially less toxic approach. With breakthroughs in immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapy and cancer vaccines, immunotherapy has improved survival rates and outcomes for patients with various cancers.\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

The Innovate UK grant, announced in November 2023, contributed to \u00a325k of total income. Operating losses were \u00a313k higher than the comparable previous period partly due to a reduction in revenues. The Company finished the half year with \u00a3269k of cash and cash equivalents. Post the period end, on 17 February 2025, the Company completed a placing and retail offer of \u00a3500k which added to the cash runway.\nBuilding on the previous year's record total value of contracts won, the Company has established a strong pipeline during the first half of the financial year, with four new contracts won. These contracts reflect the Company's strategy to broaden its offering, expanding into new modalities of therapies such as Antibody Drug Conjugates, as well as supporting clients across new phases of drug development, including Target Candidate Profiling. Based on these signed contracts, the Board expects that total income for the current financial year will be in line with market expectations, with additional contracted revenue projected into next year (year ending June 2026). The Company is actively progressing a number of late-stage opportunities, however, there is no guarantee that these contracts will be signed within the current financial year.\nOperational Highlights\nKey events during the period include:\n\u00b7\nFollow on contracts with existing clients Numab Therapeutics and Cancer Research UK.\n\u00b7\nAward of two additional contracts valued at \u00a3157,500 and \u00a365,250 respectively with a globally recognised pharmaceutical client.\n\u00b7\nAppointment of Head of Quantitative Pharmacology and Data Science, Dr Mark Davies, to lead the expansion of the Modelling and Simulation service-line and improve conversion of business development pipeline.\n\u00b7\nOfficial launch of its Biostatistics offering and expansion of its Data Science and Bioinformatics services.\nKey events after the period end:\n\u00b7\nRegulatory and Ethical approval of the Innovate UK Funded PREDICT-ONC trial to support the development of Physiomics' Personalised Medicine Dosing Software.\n\u00b7\nPublication of two original peer-reviewed scientific articles. The first written in partnership with Astellas Inc and the second with Merck KGaA, reflecting the utility and benefit of the Company's Virtual Tumour Platform to support oncology drug development.\n\u00b7\nIn February 2025, the Company completed an oversubscribed placing and retail offer generating gross proceeds of \u00a3500,000 primarily for use in funding key business growth initiatives.\nChairman and CEO's Business Strategy Update\nThe Directors are pleased that the Company is on track to meet market expectations, which, if achieved, would mean an increase of approximately 31% in total income compared with the financial year ended 30 June 2024, driven by a stronger second half of the current financial year. The Company continues to make progress in building its Modelling and Simulation pipeline, contracting a broadening range of projects. In addition to driving new client business, three of our long-standing clients signed new contracts with us within the period, reflecting the quality of work the Company provides its clients and their desire to continue receiving our support. The last six months has seen the launch of the Company's new Biostatistics service-line and implementation of Personalised Medicine Dosing Software on the DoseMeRx platform.\nConsulting business: Modelling & Simulation, Data Science and Biostatistics\nAs noted above, the Company has continued to broaden its offering across Modelling and Simulation, Data Science, and through the recent launch of its Biostatistics services. Physiomics now supports its clients with new services such as candidate selection, target identification and clinical trial design, as",

The WRAP Retail Offer, which closed at 11 a.m. today, has raised aggregate gross proceeds of \u00a370,000 through the issue of a total of 14,000,000 new Ordinary Shares, alongside the previously announced Placing of \u00a3430,000. The WRAP Retail Offer was slightly oversubscribed and was therefore subject to a small scale back.\nThe Fundraise, which is conditional on Admission, raised gross proceeds of, in aggregate, \u00a3500,000, via the issue of 86,000,000 Placing Shares pursuant to the Placing and 14,000,000 WRAP Retail Offer Shares pursuant to the WRAP Retail Offer.\nUse of Proceeds\nIn order to further develop its business and accelerate growth, the Company is raising funds to carry out the following activities and for general working capital:\n\u00b7\nMathematical Modelling Consulting Service\no\nRecruitment of further technical team members to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline and support service delivery;\no\nInvestment in Business Development and Marketing to build and strengthen the pipeline, expand into new therapeutic areas, further develop its data science offering and refresh messaging; and\no\nExplore strategic options to accelerate the growth of modelling services.\n\u00b7\nBiostatistics Consulting Service\no\nOrganic growth of the service though Business Development and Marketing to acquire clients; and\no\nExplore strategic options to accelerate the growth of biostatistics services.\n\u00b7\nPersonalised Medicine Tool Development\no\nExplore a deeper relationship with DoseMe to develop models to be implemented on their platform; and\no\nImplementation of the Company's current personalised dosing tool on the DoseMeRx Platform enabling it to be made available to clinicians across the US.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplications have been made for the Placing Shares and the WRAP Retail Offer Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM, which is expected to become effective and dealings commence on or around 8.00 a.m. on 18 February 2025 (\"\nAdmission\n\").\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will consist of 303,208,718 Ordinary Shares. Since the Company currently holds no Ordinary Shares in treasury, the total voting rights in the Company will be 303,208,718.

Combination therapies, such as those described within the paper, can offer a route to overcoming some of these biological factors and offer more successful treatments.\nIn contrast to developing monotherapies (single drug therapies), the development of combination therapies creates additional complexity to the development process as a larger number of possible experimental permutations need to be explored. If all these permutations were to be explored within preclinical or clinical settings, the additional cost and time required would become prohibitive. Physiomics addresses this challenge by offering prediction services that can be used to understand how these novel therapeutics might perform in the clinic, enabling a way to focus in on the most effective experimental permutations to explore, thus accelerating and derisking the drug development process.\nIn this publication, a mathematical model was developed to explore these different experimental permutations (doses and schedules) for combination therapies. Using Physiomics' proprietary 'Virtual Tumour' platform, the model provided a single, readily interpretable readout of tumour growth inhibition (TGI). It was also able to assess the variation in treatment response of novel drug combinations at various doses, and therefore could be used to inform clinical trial protocol design.\nThis joint publication with Physiomics' long-standing client, Merck KGaA, demonstrates the impact of the Company's Virtual Tumour platform in supporting the development of novel Oncology Therapies. Physiomics provides expertise in using modelling and simulation approaches to accelerate the development of innovative therapies across a range of therapeutic areas and across the entire drug development pathway, including early discovery and development.\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO, commented\n:\n\"We are thrilled to be able to announce this peer-reviewed publication. This is the second publication we've announced this month, highlighting the utility and benefit of our Virtual Tumour Model in supporting oncology drug development. The work described within the publication is testament to our continued relationship with Merck KGaA, a relationship established over 12 years ago and spanning over 30 contracts.\"\nEnquiries:\nPhysiomics plc\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO\n+44 (0) 1235 841575\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\n+44 (0) 203 764 2341\nStrand Hanson Limited (NOMAD)\nJames Dance & James Bellman\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nNotes to Editor\nAbout Physiomics\nPhysiomics plc combines expertise across Modelling & Simulation, Biostatistics, Data Science and Bioinformatics, together with deep biology expertise, to help biotech and pharma companies streamline their drug development journeys.

(\"Astellas\") of an original peer reviewed article\n\"A Multiple-Model-Informed Drug-Development Approach for Optimal Regimen Selection of an Oncolytic Virus in Combination with Pembrolizumab\"\nin the journal\n\"CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology\"\n.\u00a0The full article can be accessed via the following link:\nhttps://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/psp4.13297\nWith cancer being one of the leading causes of death worldwide, the development of new therapies is critical. One of the most promising class of oncology therapy is immunotherapy, an approach that can turn the power of the immune system against cancer cells. These drugs are either used on their own, or in combination with other therapies, in order to maximise patient outcomes.\nWhen developing these types of therapies, one of the major challenges is around optimising dose and timing (i.e. treatment scheduling) of the treatment so to balance out any toxic effect the drug has against the drug's efficacy; its ability to reduce or eliminate the cancer. This balance becomes even more complicated when multiple drugs are being used in combination.\nPhysiomics adds value to these these processes by offering drug development companies prediction and optimisation services through its modelling and simulation capabilities, helping to predict what treatment dose schedule to explore when progressing from preclinical research and into the clinical for the first time; balancing out toxicity with efficacy. These predictions help our clients focus on the most effective experimental permutations to explore, thus accelerating and derisking the drug development process.\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO, commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to be able to announce this peer-reviewed publication. Not only does this paper reflect the high-quality consultancy services we provided Astellas and the good relationship we built with them, but it also evidences the power and utility of our Virtual Tumour Platform in helping to develop these novel therapies\".\nIn this publication, Physiomics' proprietary 'Virtual Tumour' platform was deployed using a multiple model-informed drug-development (\"MIDD\") approach framework to explore different dose and scheduling strategies. The output of these models helped describe the expected synergy of a immunotherapy combination for the purpose of Phase-1 clinical study design.\nThis joint publication between Physiomics and Astellas demonstrates the impact of using modelling and simulation approaches to accelerate the development of innovative therapies across a range of therapeutic areas and throughout the entire drug development pathway, including early discovery and clinical development. The peer-reviewed article also demonstrates the power of Physiomics' Virtual Tumour platform in supporting world-leading pharmaceutical companies develop these important new therapies.\nEnquiries:\nPhysiomics plc\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO\n+44 (0)1235 841575\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\n+44 (0) 203 764 2341\nStrand Hanson Ltd (NOMAD)\nJames Dance & James Bellman\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nNotes to Editor\nAbout Physiomics\nPhysiomics plc combines expertise across Modelling & Simulation, Biostatistics, Data Science and Bioinformatics, together with deep biology expertise, to help biotech and pharma companies streamline their drug development journeys.

It plays a pivotal role in the setup, conduct and reporting of all trials, regardless of therapeutic area, ensuring studies are well designed, data is accurately collected and analysed, and the results are interpreted correctly.\nFor example, during the design of interventional trials, biostatistics is used to calculate the optimum number of patients to be recruited and help define what data should be collected so that the effect of the therapy can be detected, balancing this against the size and cost of the trial.\nThe strategic rationale for Physiomics to develop the new Biostatistics services is three-fold. Firstly, the application of Modelling & Simulation and Biostatistics in drug development overlaps, with often the output of the former being a key input to the latter, allowing for natural follow-on work to be offered to clients. Secondly, biostatistics is a necessary component to the setup, conduct and reporting of any interventional clinical trial, from Phase 1 through to Phase 4, regardless of the therapeutic area. This opens a significant market for the Company, giving greater opportunity to scale. Finally, with both service lines utilising the same business model and similar expertise across mathematics and data science, this allows the Company to operate flexible staffing across service lines to meet demand and maximise utilisation.\nData Science and Bioinformatics\n:\nData Science and Bioinformatics have also become critical capabilities across the drug development continuum. From discovery through into the clinic, the volume and complexity of data being generated is increasing significantly, driven in part by advancements in technologies and regulatory pressures. Being able to effectively make use of this often-disparate data and derive insights from it is often where the challenge lies for drug developers. Data science and Bioinformatics tools and methodologies allow for the effective selection, curation, analysis and visualisation of this data.\nThe Company has already been leveraging Data Science and Bioinformatics tools and methodologies as part of its core Modelling and Simulation service line, selecting and curating data required to develop and calibrate its models. The opportunity to use these tools and models outside Modelling and Simulation has become more apparent, with the Company delivering on its first pure Data Science and Bioinformatics project earlier in the year. During this project, the Company supported the client capture and curated a wide range of publicly available data relating to novel oncology drug targets. The data was processed and then presented in a form that allowed the client to determine the optimum drug target across a variety of tissue types. Physiomics is keen to build upon this success and identify new opportunities in this space.\nLaunch\n:\nAs of 30 September 2024, Physiomics has officially launched its new Biostatistics offering, as well as its expanded offering in Data Science and Bioinformatics, allowing the Company to offer a more integrated offering to its clients. To coincide with this, the Company has completed an update of its website (\nwww.physiomics.co.uk\n) and marketing materials to support a variety of go-to-market activities and campaigns over the coming weeks.\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO, commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to have launched the new Biostatistics service line, as well as expand our Data Science and Bioinformatics Services. Not only can we now provide our clients a great breadth of services to support their drug development efforts, but these new services are an important component of the Company's growth strategy.\"\nEnquiries:\nPhysiomics plc\nDr Peter Sargent, CEO\n+44 (0)1235 841575\nHybridan LLP (Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\n+44 (0) 203 764 2341\nStrand Hanson Ltd (NOMAD)\nJames Dance & James Bellman\n+44 (0)20 7409 3494\nNotes to Editor\nAbout Physiomics\nPhysiomics plc combines cutting edge PKPD and QSP modelling and data science techniques, along with deep biology expertise, to help biotech and pharma companies streamline their drug development journeys.\nOur approach is to derive insight from all relevant data in order to de-risk decis",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

There could certainly be some shared synergies if PYC and S-Cubed Biometrics were to work together.   PS/JM have talked in the last 12 months about potential partnerships to grow the business.

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

In practice, this insight helps our partners optimise dosing and scheduling, de-risk combination therapy strategies, and design more targeted clinical trials \u2013 all grounded in biological, not just empirical, evidence. As we can develop these models early in development and update as clinical data is generated, we can offer our clients a clear, model-based rationale for dosing decisions. With the FDA's Project Optimus shifting focus toward the Optimal Biological Dose rather than Maximum Tolerated Dose, that's no small thing' VT predictive model proven to work successfully over many years and continually being upgraded.

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Importantly if we look at placings, FAB placed last year at 6.75p and is nearly double that, PYC placed at 0.5p and is just over half of that, the other share has nearly doubled the placing price in 6 days. Why didn't PYC do better after raising those funds last year?",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

There could certainly be some shared synergies if PYC and S-Cubed Biometrics were to work together.   PS/JM have talked in the last 12 months about potential partnerships to grow the business.

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years... How many years have you been invested in PYC???",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though?

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

The more this happens, the more investors are wary, the harder the P&Ders have to work, and only for a few % now. In the old days, a heftier % would be made. Meanwhile, Docetaxel is still in its \"development\" stage, its been there for a few years now??  \"Validation\" has to be nearer every day that passes? Back in my box i go.",

These are met by selling and last no more than 24-48 hours (you can already see the day traders selling from this morning). I was lucky enough to take a large profit in January last year almost exactly a year ago when a large buyer appeared and bought lots of stock, they have now exited at a large loss and no real interest apart from the pump and dump crews with a little profit from another rise elsewhere jumping on here after Laura spams the other BBs.",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

Unfortunately there are more believable fairy tales than what a BoD member tells a PI on the phone. So you have to look at the bigger picture, who have to ask others around the situation, do you remember me posting that I spoke with a mate who worked with PS and he couldn't believe he was working for such a small salary and asked what options he had and I couldn't find any of importance, so no surprise he is moving on, he was much better calibre than the CEO job here, perhaps he felt it would have got better, but his departure suggests this is just doing the same old as it has for years...

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Dosing Tool31 Jan 2026 11:41 Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022 500 hospitals globally \u2022 at \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

          "content": "A quick reality check summary from AI. Facts need to be checked - DYODD. I have no position. Physiomics Plc (ticker: PYC.L on AIM, London Stock Exchange) is a small UK-based biotech/consulting company focused on providing quantitative pharmacology and computational biology services, primarily in oncology, using tools like their Virtual Tumour platform to support pharma and biotech clients in drug development.Brief financial health summary (based on trailing twelve months / most recent available data as of early 2026):Revenues: Approximately \u00a3834,000 (ttm). This is modest and from consulting/services, with some quarterly growth noted (e.g., +154% yoy in one recent period, though overall annual trends have been flat/declining in prior years). Profitability: Loss-making, with net losses around \u00a3415,000 (ttm), negative margins (~-50%), and ongoing operational losses (EBITDA ~ -\u00a3446,000). Cash burn: Operating cash flow is negative, around -\u00a3546,000 (ttm), with free cash flow similarly negative (~ -\u00a3419,000). This reflects a typical small AIM biotech/services burn rate for a company of this size. Cash position / runway: Cash reserves appear limited (market cap is only ~\u00a30.85m\u2013\u00a31.4m, with very low share price ~0.28p). The company has less than 1 year of cash runway based on current burn (per analyses), has a history of dilution/raisings to bolster cash, and shows weak balance sheet metrics (e.g., high negative ROE ~ -85%, low cash relative to operations). Overall, the company is in a challenging position \u2014 micro-cap, loss-making, with low revenues insufficient to cover costs, ongoing cash burn, and reliance on occasional contract wins or funding rounds to survive. It's a high-risk AIM stock with volatility and dilution history. Not in strong health; more of a speculative/niche play.",

          "content": "Precision Dosing Tool \u2013 Multi-Million Revenue Potential Physiomics\u2019 precision dosing technology, developed in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics, NHS Blackpool and DoseMeRx, represents one of the company\u2019s most significant long-term value drivers. Unlike traditional consultancy revenue, this is a scalable, recurring, software-driven product with global distribution through DoseMeRx, which is already deployed across hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. Once fully validated and commercialised, the dosing tool can be licensed per hospital, per department, or per clinician, creating a high-margin, repeat-revenue model rather than one-off service fees. Comparable Example A close comparator is DoseMeRx itself and other clinical decision-support platforms such as InsightRX (precision dosing software used by hospitals for drug optimisation). These platforms operate on subscription models that can generate multi-million annual revenues through hospital licensing and per-patient usage fees. With even modest adoption \u2014 for example: \u2022\t500 hospitals globally \u2022\tat \u00a310,000 per year per site This would already represent \u00a35 million per year in recurring revenue. At larger scale, this figure can reasonably rise into the tens of millions annually, before accounting for expansion into additional drugs and indications. Strategic Value Because this product sits directly inside a global platform (DoseMeRx), Physiomics does not need to build a global sales force to scale \u2014 the route to market is already in place. This dramatically lowers commercial risk and increases the likelihood of rapid adoption. This single asset alone has the potential to transform Physiomics from a niche consultancy into a high-margin healthcare software company, justifying a valuation many times higher than its current market capitalisation GlobalData",

NHS / Innovate UK-backed Projects Projects such as PREDICT-ONC in partnership with Beyond Blood Diagnostics and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are progressing validation of predictive tools using real patient data \u2014 a crucial clinical step before broad commercial rollout. Bringing real clinical outcomes data back into development strengthens commercial traction, regulatory discussions, and future licensing or payer adoption. Financial Position \u2014 Cash & Growth Outlook Physiomics has: \u2022\tsignificantly increased contracted forward revenue, with nearly \u00a3594k contracted into the next fiscal year, up ~19% year-on-year. \u2022\traised growth funding via oversubscribed placings to fuel sales, BD, and capability expansion. \u2022\tstrong cash balances supported by fundraising early 2025 and improved operating performance (less loss and stronger revenue growth). This paints a picture of a business that is carefully managing cash, investing in growth, and improving its sales pipeline \u2014 all supportive of future valuation uplift. Valuation Opportunity & Strategic Optionality A. Undervaluation Relative to Peers Many comparable service-oriented CROs and specialised modelling players trade at multiples that imply market caps far above Physiomics\u2019 current valuation, based on growth trajectory and recurring revenue potential. Given pipeline conversion, recurring revenue from dosing software, and continued contract wins, re-rating to a market cap in the tens of millions GBP is justified with even modest growth assumptions. B. Acquisition Interest & Strategic M&A Optionality Physiomics\u2019 capabilities \u2014 especially Virtual Tumour\u2122, PK/PD modelling teams, biostatistics services, and DoseMeRx partnership \u2014 could be compelling as a bolt-on acquisition for larger CROs, pharma consultancies, or digital health firms looking to embed advanced simulation and personalised dosing technology into their offerings. The highly technical nature of its services and proprietary tools makes it a strategic fit for larger players seeking niche but valuable intellectual assets. This optionality adds valuation upside beyond traditional revenue multiples. Conclusion Physiomics plc stands at the intersection of high-value drug development services, proprietary modelling technology, and next-generation personalised dosing tools \u2014 a combination that is under-appreciated in its current share price. Key investment thesis points: \u2714 Proven technology with proprietary differentiator in Virtual Tumour\u2122. \u2714 Established clients including global pharma and research organisations. \u2714 Growing contracted revenue and diversified services. \u2714 Strategic software partnership (DoseMeRx) with global reach. \u2714 Clinical validation partnerships with NHS and Innovate funding. \u2714 Significant upside relative to peers and M&A optionality.",

          "content": "Executive Summary Physiomics plc (AIM: PYC) is uniquely positioned as a specialist modelling & simulation, PK/PD, QSP, data science and biostatistics consultancy serving biotech and pharmaceutical clients. The company has proprietary technology, an expanding client roster including global life-science names, growing contracted revenue, strategic partnerships in personalised medicine, and an industry-wide shift toward model-informed drug development \u2014 yet its market valuation lags materially behind peers and intrinsic value. Core Business Strengths Proprietary, High-Value Technologies Physiomics\u2019 Virtual Tumour\u2122 platform is a proprietary modelling technology used to predict drug effects (particularly in oncology and combination therapies). This kind of platform is rare in small CROs and provides differentiated, defensible IP in a technical niche that is becoming central to drug development \u2014 a high-barrier asset that competitors do not replicate easily. Strong Revenue Momentum & Expanding Services \u2022\tThe company achieved record levels of contract wins in recent years with over \u00a31m average annual pipeline wins. \u2022\tModelling & Simulation revenue grew substantially (e.g., 44% year-on-year). \u2022\tIntroduction of a Biostatistics/Statistical Programming service line broadens the addressable market and client utility. These trends point to scalable core services, fee-for-service cash inflows, and repeat business, which are hallmarks of enterprise value. Commercial Validation from High-Profile Clients Physiomics\u2019 client roster features established global players and innovative biotechs, providing both credibility and commercial stability: Confirmed clients include: \u2022\tMerck KGaA (global pharmaceutical). \u2022\tNumab Therapeutics (clinical-stage biotech). \u2022\tCancer Research UK (major nonprofit research organisation). \u2022\tAstellas, Bicycle Therapeutics. Winning contracts from (and extensions with) these organisations indicate trusted delivery and deep technical relevance \u2014 a clear signal that expertise, not just price, defines the company\u2019s work. Strategic Growth Drivers Beyond Core Consultancy A. Personalised Dosing Tool & DoseMe Partnership Physiomics has integrated its dose-optimization software into DoseMeRx\u2019s global platform (a leading clinician toolset), establishing a route to meaningful recurring revenue once fully commercialised. This is more than a research collaboration \u2014 it bridges clinical use with market adoption, meaning the dosing tool alone could eventually become a revenue stream worth tens of millions GBP if uptake grows worldwide, given the reach and scale of DoseMeRx.",

Importantly if we look at placings, FAB placed last year at 6.75p and is nearly double that, PYC placed at 0.5p and is just over half of that, the other share has nearly doubled the placing price in 6 days. Why didn't PYC do better after raising those funds last year?",

Two of my biggest holdings have had placings in the last week, both have money, but to accelerate drilling in the case of one and to accelerate the marketing of a newly launched platform in the case of the other. Both have money and income coming in, but both also have large HNW investors and IIs wanting to get onboard, so the upshot is both have strengthened their balance sheet and can accelerate forwards. Both placings were at no or miniscule discount and I am happy that both have done so. Here at PYC there are no HNW or II investors to come on board, there will be no acceleration of development due to the piecemeal contracts flowing through and operating at a loss will mean they will need to raise funds to cover that soon. Rather than looking at revenue, have a look at the SPs in the last year, both mine saw a slight drop in revenue year on year, which would you rather have held though? PYC down over 70%, FAB up 45%, my other large holding is up 840%",
