The plan follows the main historic riverbed through the Raglan Project area.\n\u00b7\nDark blue\nrepresents the area targeted for mining\n\u00b7\nGreen\nshows areas previously trenched by historical operators\nFigure 1\nThe proposed mineable area defined at this stage comprises approximately\n162,000 m\u00b2\n.\nAssuming gold-bearing gravels extend to an average depth of\n1.5 metres\n, the initial plan would cover approximately\n243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material,\nwhich ECR would intend to mine and process over a multi-year period\n.\nUsing what the Board considers to be a conservative average grade of\n0.12 grammes per bank cubic metre\n, derived from all test work completed to date (including lower-grade material), the Phase 1 mining area is illustratively estimated to contain approximately\n938 ounces of gold\n.\nAt current gold prices, this would equate to an indicative gross\nin-situ\nvalue of approximately\nA$7 million\n.\nKey Assumptions and Scope\nInvestors should note that the analysis is internal and illustrative only and is only disclosed for the purpose of providing geological context and to assist in understanding the rationale for the Company's\nPhase 1 mining plan and has not been\nverified or validated by any third parties.\nThe Directors consider that the analysis is intentionally conservative and based on the following assumptions:\n\u00b7\nThe average grade used reflects all test results to date, including lower-grade material and the analysis assumes that this is representative across the Phase 1 mining area\n\u00b7\nGold-bearing gravel depth is expected to vary across the project area and the analysis assumes that an average depth of\n1.5 metres\nis representative across the Phase 1 mining area, to provide approximately\n243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material for processing\n\u00b7\nThe analysis assumes that a minimum gross gold price of A$7,150 per ounce will be achievable over the\nmulti-year period required to mine and process 243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material\n\u00b7\nPreviously mined areas are assumed to contain no recoverable gold\n\u00b7\nNo allowance has been made for side creeks, extensions along strike, deeper gravels or optimisation of mining methods. Proposed mineable side creeks are highlighted in yellow in Figure 1.\nThe analysis is based on internal operational planning work and does not constitute a mineral resource or reserve estimate, or a resource update in accordance with the AIM Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies (the \"AIM MOG Note\"). In addition, nor was any analysis prepared to the standards set forth in the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (\"JORC\") or prepared in accordance with any other appropriate internationally recognised reporting standard (\"Standard\") for mineral resources and reserves as set out in the AIM MOG Note.\nClear Path to Expansion\nImportantly, the work completed to date represents only the\ninitial phase of mining planned at the Raglan Project\n. The defined area has been selected to provide a conservative, clearly delineated starting point for operations.\nOver the coming weeks, the Company intends to dig and process a series of test pits at the northern end of the Raglan Project area outside of the Phase 1 area. These test pits are expected to provide additional insight into gravel depth variability, grade distribution and potential extensions to the current mine plan, whilst generating cash flow.\nAs mining progresses and operational data is gathered, ECR expects to refine and potentially expand the mining footprint over time, with the objective of\nextending mine life, increasing prospective annual gold output and enhancing overall returns from the Raglan Project\n.\nECR's Chairman,\nNick Tulloch,\ncommented:\n\"This work gives us a clear and compelling starting point for mining at the Raglan Project. Using deliberately conservative assumptions and focusing only on the main historic river channel, the initial mining plan alone demonstrates the potential to deliver a strong multiple of our original acquisition cost in gold revenue over the coming years.\n\"What is particularly exciting is that this represents just the first phase. We have not factored in any contribution from side creeks, extensions along strike or deeper gravel horizons, all of which we intend to examine as operations progress. As we gain more operating data from site, we see a clear opportunity to refine and expand the mining plan over time, potentially extending the mine life and increasing overall returns.\n\"Against a historically strong gold price backdrop, and with plant, infrastructure and permitting already in place, we consider that the Raglan Project provides ECR with an excellent foundation for near-term cash generation and a platform from which to build a larger, longer-term alluvial operation in Queensland.\"\nReview of Announcement by Qualified Person\nThis announcement has been reviewed by Adam Jones, Chief Geologist at ECR Minerals Plc.

ECR is currently working to bring both projects into production. ECR Queensland also has three approved exploration permits covering 946 km2\u00a0over a relatively unexplored area in Lolworth Range in northern Queensland. Furthermore, it has also submitted a licence application at Kondaparinga which is approximately 120km2\u00a0in area and located within the\u00a0Hodgkinson Gold Province, 80km NW of Mareeba, North Queensland.\nFollowing the sale of the Avoca, Moormbool and Timor gold projects in Victoria, Australia to Fosterville South Exploration Ltd (TSX-V: FSX) and the subsequent spin-out of the Avoca and Timor projects to Leviathan Gold Ltd (TSX-V: LVX), ECR Australia has the right to receive up to A$2 million in payments subject to future resource estimation or production from these projects.\nECR Australia also has approximately A$76 million of unutilised tax losses incurred during previous operations.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Members of ECR's board of directors (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") have\nvisited the Proposed Offtake Partner's processing and refining facility\n, undertaken discussions regarding commercial terms and operational processes and completed site-level due diligence.\nFormal documentation and contractual agreements in respect of the Proposed Offtake Agreement are\nnow being progressed and are expected to be finalised this month\n. The Board believes that this Proposed Offtake Agreement represents a clear and practical route to market for gold produced at the Raglan Project.\nECR has also separately completed an internal valuation assessment for insurance purposes of t\nhe\nplant, equipment and site infrastructure at the Raglan Project. This process covered the wash plant, gold room, mobile mining fleet, power generation, camp facilities and associated infrastructure.\nThe\nreplacement value, on a like-for-like basis, of the plant and equipment has been assessed at approximately A$1.9 million, materially exceeding the consideration paid by ECR for the Raglan Project\n. This is considered by the Board to be further validation of the\nRaglan Project\nacquisition and, importantly, demonstrates the quality of the\nRaglan Project\n's facilities.\nWith an experienced operating team in place, an identified proposed offtake pathway and a mining lease covering approximately 300 acres, the Board considers that the Raglan Project is entering mining and production with a high level of operational and commercial confidence.\nDiscussions in relation to the Proposed Offtake Agreement remain early stage and therefore there can be no certainty that final binding terms will be agreed, nor as to the timing or final terms, value or any conditions of the Proposed Offtake Agreement. Further updates will be provided in due course.\nECR Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"Identifying the Proposed Offtake Partner and visiting their facility is an important step as the Raglan Project's production plan is being implemented. Detailed discussions and proposed terms have been discussed, and we expect to finalise the formal documentation this month. This provides confidence that there is a clear and established route to market for the Raglan Project's gold.\n\"The insurance valuation of the inventory, plant and equipment has been equally encouraging. Having visited the site, I have seen first-hand the high quality of the operations and equipment. The fact that the replacement value is close to double what we paid reinforces the value embedded in the acquisition.\n\"Together, these developments further de-risk the Raglan Project at exactly the right time. Despite recent volatility, gold prices remain at historically strong levels and with all infrastructure in place and commercial arrangements moving to being finalised, we believe that the Raglan Project is well positioned to deliver early cashflow and support the continued build-out of ECR's Queensland portfolio.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nAlex Brearley / Nick Naylor / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nOAK Securities\nJoint Broker\nJerry Keen / Robert Bell\nTel: +44 (0) 3328 5656\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nJoint Broker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nJoint Broker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company operating through three wholly owned Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Australia\"), ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\") and ECR Minerals (\nRaglan) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Raglan\")\n.\nECR Australia owns the Bailieston and Creswick gold projects in central Victoria, Australia as well as the Tambo gold project in eastern Victoria.\nRaglan Resources\nhas a mining lease at the Raglan alluvial gold project in central Queensland, Australia and ECR Queensland has two approved exploration permits over the nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.

These areas will be worked at successive depths as part of a broader programme designed to determine where gold grades are highest before progressing upstream across the property. In parallel, ECR will re-analyse previously worked ground, particularly at deeper levels, where the Board believes - consistent with outcomes at the nearby Blue Mountain Project - that recoverable gold remains\nin situ\n.\nDuring the early stages of production at the Raglan Project, the operating team will assess and optimise the configuration of mining equipment, particularly the wash plant. The objective is to maximise daily throughput while maintaining a high level of gold recovery. The Company's Blue Mountain Project has been independently tested and demonstrated a recovery rate of 91.7% gold into 0.40% of the mass, and part of the coming work programme will be aimed at assessing whether Raglan will achieve a comparable recovery rate performance.\nChairman Nick Tulloch and Directors Andrew Scott and Chris Gibbs will be meeting in Queensland later this week to oversee the initial stages of mining and production activities at the Raglan Project. During the visit, the Board members will meet with the operating team, review production progress based on early grade observations and meet with a prospective off-taker for gold production from both Raglan and Blue Mountain.\nThis milestone will coincide with exceptionally strong recent precious-metal prices, with gold currently trading above\nUS$4,988 per ounce\nand silver having recently moved through\nUS$100 per ounce\n, providing a highly favourable market backdrop as ECR enters its production phase.\nOverview of the Raglan Project - Commencement of Mining and Production\nThe Raglan Project is a fully permitted, turnkey alluvial gold project located in central Queensland and held under Mining Lease ML 3665. The project includes a near-new 60 tonne-per-hour wash plant, gold room, water supply, accommodation camp and mobile mining fleet, enabling prompt mobilisation and a low-capex pathway to production.\nWith the operating team secured and all key infrastructure already on site, Raglan is expected to deliver ECR's initial gold production and near-term early cashflow. The project also provides a foundation for shared operational capability and equipment utilisation across the Company's nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.\nThe Board considers that Raglan's anticipated operating parameters are consistent with other producing alluvial mines in Queensland, where commercial production is achieved even at relatively modest grades, particularly in the current gold price environment.\nThe Company's subsidiary that owns the Raglan Project has been renamed\nECR Minerals (Raglan) Pty Limited\n, aligning it with the branding of the Company's other Australian subsidiaries.\nPortfolio Strategy\nWhile the Raglan Project represents ECR's immediate production focus, the Board's meetings will also encompass strategic planning sessions across the Company's broader Queensland and Victoria portfolio:\n\u00b7\nBlue Mountain\n- preparations to bring the Blue Mountain gold project into production are advancing, following strong alluvial drilling results, visible coarse gold and successful wash-plant trials;\n\u00b7\nLolworth\n- a significantly-sized gold-silver project where maiden drilling provided indications of a broader mineralised system, with silver emerging as a potential key value driver at current prices; and\n\u00b7\nOther Victoria tenements\n- assessing targets for prospective exploration and development activity over the year ahead.\nECR Chairman\nNick Tulloch\ncommented\n:\n\"This week will mark an important moment for ECR. With our operating team secured and a production plan in place, several members of the Board will be travelling to Queensland to oversee the implementation of our initial mining operations at Raglan. This represents a major step forward as the Company transitions from a pure explorer into an operating gold producer.\n\"Raglan is a rare, turnkey alluvial operation with plant, permits and infrastructure already in place. Its anticipated operating parameters are considered to be consistent with other producing alluvial mines in Queensland and, with gold trading at historically high levels, we believe that the project has the potential to generate meaningful cashflow in due course.\n\"Importantly, Raglan also provides a strong operational foundation for our wider Queensland portfolio. Alongside Blue Mountain and the significantly sized Lolworth project, we believe ECR is well positioned for the year ahead, and we are excited by what lies ahead as we enter this next phase of the Company's development.\"\nReview of Announcement by Qualified Person\nThis announcement has been reviewed by Adam Jones, Chief Geologist at ECR Minerals Plc.
