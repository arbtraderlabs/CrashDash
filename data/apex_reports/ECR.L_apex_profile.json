The plan follows the main historic riverbed through the Raglan Project area.\n\u00b7\nDark blue\nrepresents the area targeted for mining\n\u00b7\nGreen\nshows areas previously trenched by historical operators\nFigure 1\nThe proposed mineable area defined at this stage comprises approximately\n162,000 m\u00b2\n.\nAssuming gold-bearing gravels extend to an average depth of\n1.5 metres\n, the initial plan would cover approximately\n243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material,\nwhich ECR would intend to mine and process over a multi-year period\n.\nUsing what the Board considers to be a conservative average grade of\n0.12 grammes per bank cubic metre\n, derived from all test work completed to date (including lower-grade material), the Phase 1 mining area is illustratively estimated to contain approximately\n938 ounces of gold\n.\nAt current gold prices, this would equate to an indicative gross\nin-situ\nvalue of approximately\nA$7 million\n.\nKey Assumptions and Scope\nInvestors should note that the analysis is internal and illustrative only and is only disclosed for the purpose of providing geological context and to assist in understanding the rationale for the Company's\nPhase 1 mining plan and has not been\nverified or validated by any third parties.\nThe Directors consider that the analysis is intentionally conservative and based on the following assumptions:\n\u00b7\nThe average grade used reflects all test results to date, including lower-grade material and the analysis assumes that this is representative across the Phase 1 mining area\n\u00b7\nGold-bearing gravel depth is expected to vary across the project area and the analysis assumes that an average depth of\n1.5 metres\nis representative across the Phase 1 mining area, to provide approximately\n243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material for processing\n\u00b7\nThe analysis assumes that a minimum gross gold price of A$7,150 per ounce will be achievable over the\nmulti-year period required to mine and process 243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material\n\u00b7\nPreviously mined areas are assumed to contain no recoverable gold\n\u00b7\nNo allowance has been made for side creeks, extensions along strike, deeper gravels or optimisation of mining methods. Proposed mineable side creeks are highlighted in yellow in Figure 1.\nThe analysis is based on internal operational planning work and does not constitute a mineral resource or reserve estimate, or a resource update in accordance with the AIM Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies (the \"AIM MOG Note\"). In addition, nor was any analysis prepared to the standards set forth in the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (\"JORC\") or prepared in accordance with any other appropriate internationally recognised reporting standard (\"Standard\") for mineral resources and reserves as set out in the AIM MOG Note.\nClear Path to Expansion\nImportantly, the work completed to date represents only the\ninitial phase of mining planned at the Raglan Project\n. The defined area has been selected to provide a conservative, clearly delineated starting point for operations.\nOver the coming weeks, the Company intends to dig and process a series of test pits at the northern end of the Raglan Project area outside of the Phase 1 area. These test pits are expected to provide additional insight into gravel depth variability, grade distribution and potential extensions to the current mine plan, whilst generating cash flow.\nAs mining progresses and operational data is gathered, ECR expects to refine and potentially expand the mining footprint over time, with the objective of\nextending mine life, increasing prospective annual gold output and enhancing overall returns from the Raglan Project\n.\nECR's Chairman,\nNick Tulloch,\ncommented:\n\"This work gives us a clear and compelling starting point for mining at the Raglan Project. Using deliberately conservative assumptions and focusing only on the main historic river channel, the initial mining plan alone demonstrates the potential to deliver a strong multiple of our original acquisition cost in gold revenue over the coming years.\n\"What is particularly exciting is that this represents just the first phase. We have not factored in any contribution from side creeks, extensions along strike or deeper gravel horizons, all of which we intend to examine as operations progress. As we gain more operating data from site, we see a clear opportunity to refine and expand the mining plan over time, potentially extending the mine life and increasing overall returns.\n\"Against a historically strong gold price backdrop, and with plant, infrastructure and permitting already in place, we consider that the Raglan Project provides ECR with an excellent foundation for near-term cash generation and a platform from which to build a larger, longer-term alluvial operation in Queensland.\"\nReview of Announcement by Qualified Person\nThis announcement has been reviewed by Adam Jones, Chief Geologist at ECR Minerals Plc.

ECR is currently working to bring both projects into production. ECR Queensland also has three approved exploration permits covering 946 km2\u00a0over a relatively unexplored area in Lolworth Range in northern Queensland. Furthermore, it has also submitted a licence application at Kondaparinga which is approximately 120km2\u00a0in area and located within the\u00a0Hodgkinson Gold Province, 80km NW of Mareeba, North Queensland.\nFollowing the sale of the Avoca, Moormbool and Timor gold projects in Victoria, Australia to Fosterville South Exploration Ltd (TSX-V: FSX) and the subsequent spin-out of the Avoca and Timor projects to Leviathan Gold Ltd (TSX-V: LVX), ECR Australia has the right to receive up to A$2 million in payments subject to future resource estimation or production from these projects.\nECR Australia also has approximately A$76 million of unutilised tax losses incurred during previous operations.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Members of ECR's board of directors (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") have\nvisited the Proposed Offtake Partner's processing and refining facility\n, undertaken discussions regarding commercial terms and operational processes and completed site-level due diligence.\nFormal documentation and contractual agreements in respect of the Proposed Offtake Agreement are\nnow being progressed and are expected to be finalised this month\n. The Board believes that this Proposed Offtake Agreement represents a clear and practical route to market for gold produced at the Raglan Project.\nECR has also separately completed an internal valuation assessment for insurance purposes of t\nhe\nplant, equipment and site infrastructure at the Raglan Project. This process covered the wash plant, gold room, mobile mining fleet, power generation, camp facilities and associated infrastructure.\nThe\nreplacement value, on a like-for-like basis, of the plant and equipment has been assessed at approximately A$1.9 million, materially exceeding the consideration paid by ECR for the Raglan Project\n. This is considered by the Board to be further validation of the\nRaglan Project\nacquisition and, importantly, demonstrates the quality of the\nRaglan Project\n's facilities.\nWith an experienced operating team in place, an identified proposed offtake pathway and a mining lease covering approximately 300 acres, the Board considers that the Raglan Project is entering mining and production with a high level of operational and commercial confidence.\nDiscussions in relation to the Proposed Offtake Agreement remain early stage and therefore there can be no certainty that final binding terms will be agreed, nor as to the timing or final terms, value or any conditions of the Proposed Offtake Agreement. Further updates will be provided in due course.\nECR Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"Identifying the Proposed Offtake Partner and visiting their facility is an important step as the Raglan Project's production plan is being implemented. Detailed discussions and proposed terms have been discussed, and we expect to finalise the formal documentation this month. This provides confidence that there is a clear and established route to market for the Raglan Project's gold.\n\"The insurance valuation of the inventory, plant and equipment has been equally encouraging. Having visited the site, I have seen first-hand the high quality of the operations and equipment. The fact that the replacement value is close to double what we paid reinforces the value embedded in the acquisition.\n\"Together, these developments further de-risk the Raglan Project at exactly the right time. Despite recent volatility, gold prices remain at historically strong levels and with all infrastructure in place and commercial arrangements moving to being finalised, we believe that the Raglan Project is well positioned to deliver early cashflow and support the continued build-out of ECR's Queensland portfolio.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nAlex Brearley / Nick Naylor / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nOAK Securities\nJoint Broker\nJerry Keen / Robert Bell\nTel: +44 (0) 3328 5656\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nJoint Broker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nJoint Broker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company operating through three wholly owned Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Australia\"), ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\") and ECR Minerals (\nRaglan) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Raglan\")\n.\nECR Australia owns the Bailieston and Creswick gold projects in central Victoria, Australia as well as the Tambo gold project in eastern Victoria.\nRaglan Resources\nhas a mining lease at the Raglan alluvial gold project in central Queensland, Australia and ECR Queensland has two approved exploration permits over the nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.

These areas will be worked at successive depths as part of a broader programme designed to determine where gold grades are highest before progressing upstream across the property. In parallel, ECR will re-analyse previously worked ground, particularly at deeper levels, where the Board believes - consistent with outcomes at the nearby Blue Mountain Project - that recoverable gold remains\nin situ\n.\nDuring the early stages of production at the Raglan Project, the operating team will assess and optimise the configuration of mining equipment, particularly the wash plant. The objective is to maximise daily throughput while maintaining a high level of gold recovery. The Company's Blue Mountain Project has been independently tested and demonstrated a recovery rate of 91.7% gold into 0.40% of the mass, and part of the coming work programme will be aimed at assessing whether Raglan will achieve a comparable recovery rate performance.\nChairman Nick Tulloch and Directors Andrew Scott and Chris Gibbs will be meeting in Queensland later this week to oversee the initial stages of mining and production activities at the Raglan Project. During the visit, the Board members will meet with the operating team, review production progress based on early grade observations and meet with a prospective off-taker for gold production from both Raglan and Blue Mountain.\nThis milestone will coincide with exceptionally strong recent precious-metal prices, with gold currently trading above\nUS$4,988 per ounce\nand silver having recently moved through\nUS$100 per ounce\n, providing a highly favourable market backdrop as ECR enters its production phase.\nOverview of the Raglan Project - Commencement of Mining and Production\nThe Raglan Project is a fully permitted, turnkey alluvial gold project located in central Queensland and held under Mining Lease ML 3665. The project includes a near-new 60 tonne-per-hour wash plant, gold room, water supply, accommodation camp and mobile mining fleet, enabling prompt mobilisation and a low-capex pathway to production.\nWith the operating team secured and all key infrastructure already on site, Raglan is expected to deliver ECR's initial gold production and near-term early cashflow. The project also provides a foundation for shared operational capability and equipment utilisation across the Company's nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.\nThe Board considers that Raglan's anticipated operating parameters are consistent with other producing alluvial mines in Queensland, where commercial production is achieved even at relatively modest grades, particularly in the current gold price environment.\nThe Company's subsidiary that owns the Raglan Project has been renamed\nECR Minerals (Raglan) Pty Limited\n, aligning it with the branding of the Company's other Australian subsidiaries.\nPortfolio Strategy\nWhile the Raglan Project represents ECR's immediate production focus, the Board's meetings will also encompass strategic planning sessions across the Company's broader Queensland and Victoria portfolio:\n\u00b7\nBlue Mountain\n- preparations to bring the Blue Mountain gold project into production are advancing, following strong alluvial drilling results, visible coarse gold and successful wash-plant trials;\n\u00b7\nLolworth\n- a significantly-sized gold-silver project where maiden drilling provided indications of a broader mineralised system, with silver emerging as a potential key value driver at current prices; and\n\u00b7\nOther Victoria tenements\n- assessing targets for prospective exploration and development activity over the year ahead.\nECR Chairman\nNick Tulloch\ncommented\n:\n\"This week will mark an important moment for ECR. With our operating team secured and a production plan in place, several members of the Board will be travelling to Queensland to oversee the implementation of our initial mining operations at Raglan. This represents a major step forward as the Company transitions from a pure explorer into an operating gold producer.\n\"Raglan is a rare, turnkey alluvial operation with plant, permits and infrastructure already in place. Its anticipated operating parameters are considered to be consistent with other producing alluvial mines in Queensland and, with gold trading at historically high levels, we believe that the project has the potential to generate meaningful cashflow in due course.\n\"Importantly, Raglan also provides a strong operational foundation for our wider Queensland portfolio. Alongside Blue Mountain and the significantly sized Lolworth project, we believe ECR is well positioned for the year ahead, and we are excited by what lies ahead as we enter this next phase of the Company's development.\"\nReview of Announcement by Qualified Person\nThis announcement has been reviewed by Adam Jones, Chief Geologist at ECR Minerals Plc.

With initial gold production at Raglan expected this month and development underway at Blue Mountain, the Board considers that ECR is now positioned to transition into a multi-project gold producer and explorer.\nThe Directors intend that the majority of the net proceeds of the Fundraising will be used to advance ECR's projects in Queensland and Victoria, specifically:\n\u00b7\nFinalising preparations to bring the Blue Mountain gold project in Queensland, Australia (the \"Blue Mountain Project\") into production to generate revenue for the Company, including securing all necessary equipment for production (noting that ECR expects some sharing of resources, and therefore economies of operation, between its Blue Mountain Project and the Raglan alluvial gold project in Queensland (the \"Raglan Project\")\n\u00b7\nTargeted exploration at the Lolworth Project, North Queensland, Australia (the \"Lolworth Project\")\nwhere last year's maiden drilling campaign produced notable shallow intercepts of gold and silver. At a 900 km2 project area, the Lolworth Project is considered by the Board to represent a potentially significant multi-metal opportunity for ECR\n\u00b7\nDeveloping the Company's partnership with the Geological Survey of Queensland and James Cook University to further investigate the critical minerals potential at the Lolworth Project\n\u00b7\nAdvancing ECR's projects in Victoria, primarily at the Bailieston Project area (the \"Bailieston Project\"), where previous drilling has indicated the presence of gold at shallow depth and potentially high grade antimony\nThe Directors also intend to apply the net proceeds of the Fundraising towards ECR's corporate and working capital purposes. Following completion of the Fundraising, and taking account of its forthcoming production plans at the Raglan and Blue Mountain Projects, the Board believes that ECR should be funded for all currently planned activities until very significantly beyond the end of 2026.\nIn the medium to longer term, the Directors believe that the cashflow potential from gold production from the Raglan Project, once that project is fully operational, has the potential to cover all of the Company's overheads and bringing Blue Mountain into production has the potential to support ECR's currently contemplated future exploration and development operations.\nDetails of the Fundraising\nThe Company has conditionally raised \u00a31.5 million (before expenses) through the Fundraising for a total of\n576,923,068\nnew Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price. The new Ordinary Shares will be issued on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to the authorities granted to the Board at the Company's annual general meeting held on 23 April 2025.\nThe new Ordinary Shares, when issued and fully paid, will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares in issue and therefore will rank equally for all dividends or other distributions declared, made or paid after the issue of the new Ordinary Shares.\nThe Issue Price represents a discount ",

Recently acquired by ECR Minerals, the Raglan Project includes a near-new 60 tonne-per-hour wash plant, a fully equipped gold room, established water supply, accommodation camp, mobile mining fleet and complete site infrastructure, providing a true turnkey mining solution. Positioned within an established gold-producing district, the Raglan Project potentially offers a low-capex, rapid pathway to production. The Raglan Project is also strategically located close to ECR's Blue Mountain alluvial project, enabling potential operational synergies across the Company's growing Queensland hub.\nECR Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"Securing our operating team is the final major step to bring the Raglan Project into production, and I am thrilled that we can now set a clear expectation of initial gold production before the end of January 2026. This is a pivotal moment in ECR's journey. The Raglan Project gives us a low-capex, near-term route into gold production, and the revenues which we ultimately anticipate should be able to support the development of our broader Queensland portfolio - most notably the much larger Blue Mountain project.\n\"Momentum across the Company has been pleasing in recent months, from strong maiden drill results at the Lolworth project confirming a gold-silver system, to completing the acquisition of the Raglan Project. With\ncurrent gold prices sitting at historically high levels, the Raglan Project has the potential to be a profitable project\n, generating meaningful cashflow in due course that can be reinvested across the business.\n\"We entered 2026 with confidence and a clear operational plan. I look forward to updating shareholders as we move into production and begin generating cashflow for the first time in ECR's history.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nAlex Brearley / Nick Naylor / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nJoint Broker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nJoint Broker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company operating through three wholly owned Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Australia\"), ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\") and\nRaglan Resources Pty Ltd (\"Raglan Resources\")\n.\nECR Australia owns the Bailieston and Creswick gold projects in central Victoria, Australia as well as the Tambo gold project in eastern Victoria.\nRaglan Resources\nhas a mining lease at the Raglan alluvial gold project in central Queensland, Australia and ECR Queensland has two approved exploration permits over the nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.

Multiple unmined creek flats are now identified as potential start-up production zones.\nLolworth - Maiden Drilling Confirms Gold-Silver System\nThe maiden drilling programme returned multiple shallow gold and silver intercepts, including 2m @ 3.57 grammes/tonne (g/t) Gold and 4m @ 7.18 g/t Silver, indicating a broader mineralised system with strong upside and several follow-up drill targets now defined. Silver mineralisation has now been mapped well beyond the areas drilled.\nRaglan - Acquisition Pending Completion & Production Pathway Secured\nECR has entered into a legally binding contract for the acquisition of the fully permitted Raglan alluvial gold project, securing a mining lease, 60-tonnes per hour wash plant, camp and mobile fleet. Following completion of the acquisition, Raglan is expected to enter production ahead of Blue Mountain and strengthen the Company's broader Queensland production strategy. Completion of the acquisition remains expected to take place before the end of 2025.\nAs part of preparations for its next phase of growth, ECR has also launched a refreshed and updated website, reflecting the Company's progression from a pure explorer towards gold production.\nExpected 2026 Operational Milestones\nECR enters the new year with a focused and deliverable plan:\n\u00b7\nRaglan: Commencement of first alluvial gold production, following completion of acquisition, site preparation and mobilisation of personnel.\n\u00b7\nBlue Mountain: Progression towards early-stage production, building on visible gold, expanding mineable corridors and further wash-plant trials.\n\u00b7\nOperational integration between Raglan and Blue Mountain, seeking to establish a scalable, repeatable alluvial production model.\n\u00b7\nLolworth: Ongoing exploration for gold, silver and REE targets.\n\u00b7\nProgression of the proposed Creswick JV discussions with Bold Gold.\n\u00b7\nStrategic use of the aggregate A$76m of ECR and Raglan tax losses, expected to materially enhance early-stage future profitability for Raglan and Blue Mountain.\nECR Chairman Nick Tulloch commented\n:\n\"2025 has been a pivotal year for ECR. Across the portfolio we have delivered meaningful progress: Blue Mountain continues to outperform expectations with visible coarse gold and expanding mineable areas; Lolworth has confirmed itself as a multi-metal system with gold, silver and rare earth potential; and the forthcoming completion of our Raglan acquisition gives us a fully permitted, turnkey alluvial gold operation ready to move towards production. Together, we consider that these milestones place ECR in its strongest operational position in recent years.\n\"We believe that the year ahead will see ECR evolve from a pure explorer into a company with nearer-term production and cashflow potential, supported by two complementary alluvial projects and substantial tax losses that enhance early economics. We enter 2026 with alignment, momentum and a clear plan to deliver a step-change year for the business.\n\"On behalf of the Board, I would like to wish all our shareholders, partners and stakeholders a safe and happy Christmas.

The purchase price is to be funded from ECR's existing cash resources.\nHighlights of the Raglan Project\n\u00b7\nGranted Mining Lease:\nthe Raglan Project includes a granted mining lease over approximately 300 acres and 2.9km of main creek systems\n\u00b7\nTurnkey Infrastructure:\nthe Raglan Project includes a near-new 60 tonne per hour wash plant, gold room, water supply, camp, mobile mining fleet and supporting facilities - ECR estimates that the second hand value of this equipment alone may be around the A$1.01m purchase price\n\u00b7\nNearer-Term Production:\nThe existing equipment and mining lease should enable gold production and cashflow within a shorter-term timeframe, with potential for more than 200 working days per year\n\u00b7\nExploration Upside:\nBulk sampling during a previous site visit confirmed coarse nuggety gold and grades that may be consistent with ECR's nearby Blue Mountain, with potential for both further alluvial resources and a hard-rock source\nRaglan Gold Project\nThe Raglan Project lies approximately 40 minutes west of Gladstone, Queensland, close to mechanical services and infrastructure. The lease has historically produced coarse, nuggety gold and test pits from ECR's due diligence confirmed recoveries from both upper gravels and deeper bedrock wash. Mining at the Raglan Project to date has been largely small scale with several untested areas and depths within the property area.\nCompletion of the Acquisition will provide ECR with plant and equipment that is estimated by management to be valued close to the purchase price alone, including a 60 tonne per hour gravity processing plant with jig and concentrator, gold room, generators, loaders, dump truck and camp facilities. These assets may also be redeployed to ECR's Blue Mountain project at a later date, which is expected to add long-term flexibility and value to ECR's broader alluvial mining operations in Queensland.\nAs stated previously, with regard to planning for future production, ECR estimates that the cost of operations at the Raglan Project, inclusive of diesel and personnel, would be around A$3,000 per day which, at the current gold price, would require production of only around 0.6 oz/day to cover overheads.\nAcquisition structure and tax losses\nECR's wholly owned subsidiary, ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\"), is acquiring Raglan Resources Pty Ltd (\"Raglan Resources\"), the current owner of the Raglan Project and its associated equipment and infrastructure. ECR Queensland has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Fire Creek Mining Pty Ltd and HIG20 Pty Ltd, the two selling shareholders of Raglan Resources. The purchase price of A$1.01 million (approximately \u00a30.5 million) in cash will be payable by ECR on completion and is fully funded from ECR's existing cash resources.\nUnder the sale and purchase agreement, completion of the Acquisition (\"Completion\") is expected to take place before the end of 2025. With the sale and purchase agreement signed, there are a limited number of mostly administrative\nmatters for the parties to address as conditions precedent to allow for Completion, including change of officers of\nRaglan Resources and updates to the company's bank accounts and regulatory filings.\nA further announcement will be made in relation to Completion in due course.\nPrior to Completion, Raglan Resources will be restructured by the Vendors whereby certain tenements and assets which are not part of the Raglan Project but are nevertheless currently owned by Raglan Resources are excluded from the Acquisition and Raglan Resources will acquired on a cash-free and debt-free basis (save that ECR will assume a bond in the favour of the state of Queensland of approximately A$13,900 in relation to the Raglan Project's mining lease). This restructuring has no bearing on ECR's planning in relation to the Acquisition.\nThe Board believes that the structure of the Acquisition should enable ECR's existing tax losses of some A$75 million to be applied against any profits generated from future production at the Raglan Project, meaning that operations are expected to be effectively tax-free for a considerable period of time.\u00a0Raglan Resources also has A$1.2 million of tax losses which will likewise be expected to be applied against future profits.\nRaglan Resources reported",

These drilling results continue to strengthen the case for\nnear-term, low-cost alluvial gold production\n, with the drilling results confirming\nvisible coarse gold\nand the expansion of multiple unmined gold-bearing creek flats.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nVisible coarse gold recorded\nin multiple drill samples from the newly identified Upper Kariboe Creek alluvial flat.\n\u00b7\nContinuity of mineralisation now mapped across\napproximately 250 metres of strike\n, with widths ranging from\n6 to 35 metres\n.\n\u00b7\nGrades exceeding the 0.15 g/b.c.m cut-off returned via\n19 intersections\n, including standout results up to\n6.52 g/b.c.m\n, typically indicating the presence of\nnuggety near-source gold\n.\n\u00b7\nWash-plant trial work at the Lower Patterson area continues to demonstrate\npractical mining grades averaging 0.35g/b.c.m\n, considered favourable to grades in\noperating alluvial mines across North Queensland\n.\n\u00b7\nMultiple areas now identified as\npotential start-up gold production zones\n, including Lower Patterson, Upper Kariboe, Windmill and Roan Colt.\nECR's Chief Geologist, Adam Jones, commented:\n\"\nThese are some of the most encouraging alluvial results we've seen from Blue Mountain to date\n.\nNot only have we mapped a continuous gold-bearing corridor across the new Upper Kariboe Creek flat, we are now also consistently seeing\nvisible coarse gold\nin multiple samples. That is always an exciting moment for a geologist, as coarse, nuggety particles typically indicate that you are close to the source and that the system has real strength.\n\"Our drilling has delivered far more than we initially expected. We set out to understand the gold trail and the host gravels, but the results are now giving us a clear picture of\nmultiple unmined zones that have the potentiual to translate into a near-term alluvial production opportunity\n.\nThe combination of strong drill grades, visible gold and the successful wash-plant trials at Lower Patterson is building genuine confidence that Blue Mountain has the scale and quality to support a commercially viable start-up operation.\"\nSummary of Drilling Program\nA total of\n264 shallow drill holes\nwere completed in August 2025 across the Upper Kariboe and Denny Gully areas. The objective was to\nidentify shallow, mineable alluvial gold deposits suitable for cost-efficient production.\nEach hole was drilled from surface to bedrock, with samples collected every metre and assessed for gold content, material type and the presence of\nvisible gold\n. Concentrated gravel samples were fire-assayed at On-Site Laboratory Services in Bendigo, and gold recovered was used to estimate\ngrammes of gold per bank cubic metre (b.c.m)\n- which is considered to be the industry standard measure for alluvial mining viability.\nInevitably, gold particle size and distribution varies in alluvial systems, but the drilling campaign has provided a\nclear, reliable picture of the gold trail\n, allowing ECR to identify high-priority potential production zones with growing confidence.\nLatest Drill Results\nThese results come from a\npreviously untested, unmined creek flat\nat Upper Kariboe Creek (See Table 1 and Figure 1). This area is now emerging as one of the strongest alluvial targets in the project to date and, as a consequence, represents a further potential extension of the potential production zones in the project area.\nKey outcomes:\n\u00b7\n19 samples\nabove the 0.15 g/b.c.m cut-off, ranging from\n0.16 g/b.c.m up to 6.52 g/b.c.m\n\u00b7\nMultiple high-grade intersections contain\ncoarse, nuggety gold\n, suggesting proximity to a primary source\n\u00b7\nMineralisation appears to form a\ncontinuous, mineable corridor approximately 230 metres long\n, with widths between\n6 - 35 metres\n\u00b7\nThis is the first area where ECR has confirmed\nlarger visible gold particles\n, representing a significant step forward in confidence\nTable 1.

The Company also provides\nan update on progress in respect of its other activities.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nHighly encouraging maiden Reverse Circulation drilling programme at the Uncle Terry and Gorge Creek West prospects delivering multiple gold and silver intercepts.\n\u00b7\nNotable shallow intercepts of gold and silver include:\n4m @ 7.18 g/t Ag\n4m @ 3.33 g/t Ag\n2m @ 3.57 g/t Au\n5m @ 0.47 g/t Au\n\u00b7\nSilver mineralisation may be significantly more widespread than the areas drilled based on outcrop mapping and sampling.\n\u00b7\nResults reinforce Lolworth as a high-priority growth project\nwithin ECR's portfolio.\n\u00b7\nBlue Mountain assay results expected before mid-December, anticipated to support near-term production momentum.\n\u00b7\nRaglan Project\nacquisition documentation\nnow agreed in all material respects, with completion expected in December, marking progress toward ECR's first alluvial gold production.\n\u00b7\nCreswick\nJV negotiations advancing positively\n,\nfollowing a successful meeting between the parties.\nECR Chief Geologist Adam Jones commented\n:\n\"We are pleased to present assay results from what has been a very successful maiden drilling campaign at the Lolworth Project. This follows the encouraging surface exploration previously completed and validates our expectations that gold mineralisation extends underneath the outcrops at the Uncle Terry and Gorge Creek West prospects. However, the stand out result is the extensive presence of silver grades. Our outcrop mapping and geochemistry indicates that this silver mineralisation is likely to be significantly broader than the areas drilled, adding further potential upside to the overall Lolworth Project. A further drilling programme will determine the scale of this potential mineralisation.\"\nECR Chairman Nick Tulloch added\n:\n\"We frequently talk about our near-term production prospects at Blue Mountain and our proposed acquisition of the Raglan project, but today's announcement of results from Lolworth, the largest project in our portfolio, is a reminder of the scale of the wider opportunities that we have before us.\n\"The drilling results speak for themselves, evidencing extensive mineralisation over our target prospects of Uncle Terry and Gorge Creek West. But significantly, for a project that we have previously referred to as being focused on gold and rare earths, we can now add silver as a target metal. Silver prices have reached all-time highs earlier in 2025, with its price growth so far this year outpacing that of gold. Many analysts forecast ongoing silver price strength. We had already identified Lolworth as being one of our core tenements, but the opportunity has now become even more interesting.\n\"In a year of considerable change for ECR, we are still working on several projects. At a corporate level, we are looking to conclude our proposed acquisition of the Raglan project and pursue our proposed Creswick JV and, at the operational level, we look forward to the remaining results from the drilling at Blue Mountain which we expect to announce before mid-December.\"\nSummary of the Maiden Drilling Campaign at the Lolworth Project\nA total of 28 reverse circulation drill holes (1,058 metres in aggregate) were completed in September and October 2025 over two gold prospects at the Lolworth Project known as Uncle Terry and Gorge Creek West. This is the first drilling campaign to be completed by an exploration company within this part of the Lolworth Range. Drilling followed up on previous years' rock chip sampling of outcrops, where sporadic Galena (AgPb sulphide) mineralisation had been observed.\nThe Uncle Terry prospect was formally named and discovered by previous tenement holders A.R.I Limited in 1988 where Galena was observed in a quartz outcrop. Grab samples from the outcrop during their discovery included 34 g/t Au and 6 g/t Au. The original location of the discovery has only been recently identified. The outcrop was initially thought to strike in a north-south direction; however, ECR's recent mapping and drill programme suggests that the vein strikes east-west, dipping to the south.\nSee Figure One for the location of drill holes at Uncle Terry and Figure Two for the location of drill holes at Gorge Creek West.\nSix drill holes (LWDR001 to LWDR006 and LWDR008 to LWDR009) were initially drilled underneath and down plunge of the original Uncle Terry discovery outcrop. Another six holes (LWDR007 and LWDR010 to LWDR013) were drilled just south of the discovery site to test for miner",

Visible gold has been confirmed in multiple zones and preliminary results were announced on 15 September 2025 confirming extensive gold mineralisation in the Lower Patterson area. Samples from the remaining holes have been sent for assay and results are expected this month.\nThe rig then moved to Lolworth where ECR drilled 21 holes at the Uncle Terry prospect and a further seven holes at the Gorge Creek West prospect, to depths of between 30 and 42 metres, during September. Drill samples have now been packaged and recorded and are also with the laboratory for assay.\nFollowing completion of activities at Lolworth, the ECR team returned to Blue Mountain where several wash plant trials were conducted to determine the likely gold recovery. The trials were conducted over both high and low grade material and preliminary observations based on visible gold have been encouraging.\nAs previously announced, the distribution of gold particles within the alluvial gravels at Blue Mountain is not yet fully known. Drill samples are small volumes of material and so, whilst drill results are indicative of the location of gold and therefore where mining may in the future take place, they are not suitable for resource estimation or for providing a definitive indication of grade. The wash plant trials are conducted with bulk samples which are designed to determine a more representative gold content and potential\nrecovery rate\n. Interestingly, and based on visible analysis, results appear to be better in the\nlower grade material areas\n. This supports ECR's theory that there is an element of coarse gold at Blue Mountain which cannot always be reliably picked up from drill samples.\nFurther analysis of the wash plant samples is currently being conducted.\nAlthough several results are outstanding, the information to date supports ECR's belief in respect of the commercial opportunity at Blue Mountain. Once all the results are available, ECR intends to submit a mining lease application in the fourth quarter of 2025, as the next step towards production at Blue Mountain and cashflow generation.\nRaglan Project - Near-Term Production of Alluvial Gold\nAs announced on 1 October 2025 and 17 October 2025, ECR is proposing to acquire\nRaglan Resources Pty Ltd (the \"\nProposed Acquisition\n\"), the holder of\nLicence ML 3665 (the \"Raglan Project\")\nfor\nA$1.01 million\n. The purchase price is fully funded by the subscription announced on\n1 October 2025\n.\nLegal documentation is now very advanced and subject only to comments from the vendors' lawyers. All due diligence questions have also been submitted and, to date, the information supplied has been in line with ECR's expectations. As such, ECR anticipates completing the Proposed Acquisition this month.\nPending anticipated completion of the\nProposed Acquisition\n, ECR has also begun discussions with a potential production team, the aim being to ensure that gold production at the Raglan Project can begin within a relatively short time thereafter.\nThere can be no certainty that final binding terms will be agreed in order to complete the Proposed Acquisition, nor as to the timing or final terms, value or conditions of the Proposed Acquisition. Further updates will be provided in due course.\nOther tenements\nOn 18 September 2025, ECR\nannounced that it had entered into a non-binding heads of terms with Exertis Pty Ltd trading as Bold Gold (\"Bold Gold\") for a proposed joint venture (t",

The Lolworth Project remains free of native title claims, enabling straightforward and low-cost exploration access.\nThe 2025 drill programme has successfully validated the Company's geological interpretation of gold and silver-bearing vein systems at Uncle Terry prospect, with all predicted veins intersected. ECR drilled 21 reverse circulation (\"RC\") holes at the Uncle Terry prospect and a further seven at the Gorge Creek West prospect, to depths of between 30 and 42 metres.\nECR's chief geologist Adam Jones, who has been on site throughout the drilling campaign, reported strong visual results including multiple intersections of sulphides and, in particular, visible silver mineralisation. Rock chip sampling and soil XRF analysis will be undertaken before Adam's departure from site, with initial assay results from the drilling campaign expected in the coming weeks.\nBlue Mountain Project\nAt Blue Mountain, ECR is finalising its most extensive alluvial gold drilling programme to date, with close to 400 holes completed across the Lower Patterson, Windmill and Upper Kariboe Creek areas. Visible coarse gold has been confirmed in multiple zones.\nAdam Jones is expected to return to the Blue Mountain Project site next week to pan and weigh more than 150 samples prior to detailed assay testing. These results are expected to feed into the upcoming wash plant trials, which will include selective testing of both high-and-low-grade material to validate the drill results and inform an initial internal resource estimate.\nFollowing the conclusion of wash plant trials, and therefore evidence of the extent of the commercial opportunity at the Blue Mountain Project, ECR intends to submit a mining lease application during Q4 2025, an important milestone towards near-term production and cashflow generation.\nRaglan Project - near-term production of Alluvial Gold\nThe Raglan Project, located near Gladstone, Queensland, represents a fully permitted alluvial gold operation with an existing mining lease and a 60-tonne-per-hour wash plant on site. Following a successful due diligence site visit earlier this month, ECR is aiming to complete the\nProposed Acquisition\nin the coming weeks and is already preparing personnel for mobilisation. The final stages of the\nProposed Acquisition\nare expected to involve concluding the legal documentation and due diligence. This is well underway and proceeding satisfactorily and, in particular, the parties have agreed certain simplifications of the structure.\nECR will now only acquire\nRaglan Resources Pty Ltd (\"Raglan Resources\"), the holder of\nLicence ML 3665,\nand Raglan Mining Pty Ltd will be retained by the vendors. This is part of the pre-completion restructuring of\nRaglan Resources by the vendors so that any unrelated tenements and non-core assets can be excluded from the\nProposed Acquisition, in line with the Company's notification on 1 Oc",

Following this announcement, the Board of directors of ECR (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") has received the results of the technical due diligence site visit to the Raglan Project, which commenced on 29 September 2025 and has now concluded with results that the Board considers to be very satisfactory.\nHighlights of the Proposed Acquisition\n\u00b7\nGranted Mining Lease:\nthe Raglan Project includes a granted mining lease over approximately 300 acres and 2.9km of main creek systems, allowing operations to commence in the nearer-term following completion of the Proposed Acquisition\n\u00b7\nTurnkey Infrastructure:\nthe Proposed Acquisition includes a near-new 60 tonne per hour wash plant, gold room, water supply, camp, mobile mining fleet and supporting facilities - the due diligence site visit has provided confidence for management estimating that the second hand value of this equipment alone may be near to the A$1.1m purchase price for the Proposed Acquisition\n\u00b7\nNearer-Term Revenue Potential:\nexisting equipment and mining lease could enable gold production and cashflow in the nearer-term, with the results of due diligence indicating the potential for more than 200 working days per year\n\u00b7\nExploration Upside:\nBulk sampling during the site visit confirms coarse nuggety gold and grades that may be consistent with ECR's nearby Blue Mountain Project, with potential for both further alluvial resources and a hard-rock source.\nThe Raglan Project\nThe Raglan Project lies approximately 40 minutes west of Gladstone, Queensland, close to mechanical services and infrastructure. The lease has historically produced coarse, nuggety gold and test pits excavated duringthe due diligence confirmed recoveries from both upper gravels and deeper bedrock wash. Mining at the Raglan Project to date has been largely small scale with several untested areas and depths within the property area.\nThe due diligence site visit was conducted by ECR's Chief Geologist, Adam Jones, who assessed the mining lease, plant and equipment, and overall development potential. The equipment, including the gravity processing plant, was tested during the due diligence and found to be in good working order. Equally importantly, the test pits that were processed earlier this week yielded quantities of gold that the Board believes supports the commercial potential of the Raglan Project. The pits were dug in different parts of the property and the recovery from them, coupled with exploration upside observed on site, confirms to the Board that the Raglan Project has the potential to be a valuable asset for the Company.\nAround three quarters of the gold produced during ECR's due diligence was\nin small nuggets (up to 0.5 gramme pieces) with the\nRaglan Project\n's fine gravity concentrator recovering the balance as fine gold.\nThe gold produced during the due diligence at Raglan was coarse, often with sharp edges potentially indicating a local source. Similarly, some particles of gold were observed attached to quartz, also indicating that a local source of the gold may be in the upper part of the lease area.\nCompletion of the Proposed Acquisition would provide ECR with plant and equipment that is estimated by management to be valued near to the purchase price alone, including a 60 tonne per hour gravity processing plant with jig and concentrator, gold room, generators, loaders, dump truck and camp facilities. These assets can also be redeployed for use at Blue Mountain at a later date, adding long-term flexibility and value.\nWith regard to planning for future production, based on the work programme completed this week, ECR currently estimates that the cost of operations at the Raglan Project, inclusive of diesel and two personnel, would be around A$3,000 per day which, at the current gold price, would require production of only around 0.6 oz/day to cover such overheads.\nECR Minerals, Chief Geologist, Adam Jones commented:\n\"Our assessment at Raglan confirmed that the project offers both nearer-term production potential as well as what may be an interesting exploration upside. The existing wash plant and machinery all ran smoothly during my time on site and could be operated with minimal personnel. The coarse nuggety gold observed is encouraging and the geology indicates further opportunities not only within the alluvial gravels but also from a possible hard-rock source.

With a mining licence and all capital equipment included in the Proposed Acquisition, the Directors believe that the Raglan Project represents an opportunity to fast-track ECR's alluvial gold production plans.\nThe Raglan Project is located close to ECR's existing Blue Mountain gold project in Queensland, Australia (the \"Blue Mountain Project\") and the board of directors of ECR (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") believe that the Proposed Acquisition will represent a strategic expansion of its footprint and operations in the region. The Proposed Acquisition will be conditional on,\ninter alia\n, satisfactory results from site investigations which will be carried out by ECR, the completion of binding underlying transaction documentation, and the completion of the Subscription (as defined below).\nThe Company also announces that it has conditionally raised \u00a30.65 million (before expenses) by way of a direct subscription (the \"Subscription\") for a total of 325,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.001 pence each in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at a price of 0.20 pence per new Ordinary Share (the \"Issue Price\"). The Directors currently intend for the net proceeds of the Subscription to be used predominantly to fund the purchase price that will be payable for completion of the Proposed Acquisition.\nAllenby Capital Limited (\"Allenby Capital\") acted as the Company's broker in connection with the Subscription.

ECR's only commitment will be to assist Bold Gold in certain renewals of the Project's licences.\nUpon the execution of a binding joint venture agreement, Bold Gold will commit to a minimum exploration spend of A$250,000 during the first 12 months of the JV. Following this, Bold Gold will also commit to spend an aggregate of A$1.25 million on exploration in the Project area over a two-year period, to earn an interest of 51% in the Project. Thereafter, Bold Gold would spend a further A$1.75 million (or A$1.5 million should part of the Project be converted into a retention licence or otherwise renewed) on exploration in the Project area over a further two year period, to earn an interest of 80% in the Project.\nBold Gold would be obliged to spend not less than an aggregate of A$1.25 million before it secures any interest in the Project.\nA joint venture committee will also be established, comprising two representatives from each company, to determine the Project's work programme.\nAt the point at which Bold Gold earns into 80% of Creswick, ECR can elect either to pay for its 20% share of future operational expenditure on the Project area or convert its interest to a royalty on terms to be agreed at that time.\nThe Proposed JV will be subject to, among other things, due diligence by Bold Gold, entry into a legally binding JV agreement and satisfaction of regulatory requirements. There can therefore be no certainty that final binding terms will be agreed, nor as to the timing or final terms, value or conditions of the Proposed JV.\nThe Board views the Proposed JV as consistent with its strategy of maximising value from its Victorian assets while prioritising its own time and resources on exploration and nearer-term production opportunities in Queensland. ECR's flagship\nBlue Mountain Gold Project\nis advancing towards potential near-term production, while the Company continues systematic exploration at its\nLolworth Gold and Rare Earths Project\n, which the Board believes is one of the largest underexplored tenements in North Queensland.\nNext Steps\nBold Gold has commenced its due diligence process and will shortly be granted access to ECR's Creswick data room. Following successful due diligence, the parties expect to enter into a binding joint venture agreement. Further announcements will be made in due course.\nECR Minerals Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"We are delighted with Bold Gold's interest in Creswick. Creswick has been a significant part of ECR's portfolio for some time and work we have carried out there has consistently identified gold mineralisation. Set in the heart of Victoria's gold industry, we remain of the view that the Project carries considerable potential upside.\n\"However, our strategic focus is on developing the potential commercial production opportunity we have at Blue Mountain, along with the high potential exploration programme at Lolworth. The Proposed JV achieves our aim of freeing up management time and financial resources to concentrate on these projects whilst still maintaining an interest in Creswick which can now be developed further without dilution to our shareholders.\n\"The team at Bold Gold have a detailed knowledge of the Project area and we are looking forward to working with them to advance the opportunities at Creswick. The next steps are due diligence and preparing a joint venture agreement which we expect to do as quickly as practicable.\"\nCreswick Gold Project, Victoria\nThe Creswick Gold Project, located in central Victoria and covering approximately 45 km\u00b2, is co",

Five traverses were drilled, consisting of 36 holes, each having an individual depth ranging from approximately 5 to 12 metres, with a total combined depth of 291 metres. Samples were collected at one-metre intervals from surface to basement contact, with each 115 mm-diameter sample representing approximately 10 kg in 0.01 cubic metres of material. The purpose of this type of drilling is not to recover a representative sample in alluvial terrains but to confirm the presence of gold (visually) followed up by assays to detect very fine-grained gold. Assay results are only indicative of gold content.\nEach sample was panned down to a representative concentrate of around 100 grammes. Visible gold was logged and visually estimated. Concentrate samples were then analysed at OSLS-Bendigo for total gold content, reported in milligrams per sample. Results were converted to an estimated bank cubic metre (b.c.m) equivalent to using a factor of 96.27 samples per b.c.m.\nThe strongest mineralised intervals (\u22650.15 g per b.c.m) were recorded in three drill sections, including total aggregated widths of 66 metres in Section 1, 11 metres in Section 2, and 81 metres across four zones in Section 3. These results are considered to highlight the very extensive scale of gold-bearing gravels within the Lower Patterson area (\nSee Figure 1\n).\nThe objective of this initial drill programme was to map out the\nextent and scale\nof the mineralised alluvial zones. Based on the results received, the exercise is considered by management to have been highly successful. Noting that the Lower Patterson area has not previously been mined, this represents a potential extension of the Blue Mountain Project. Furthermore, the current gold price levels and the shallow depths at Blue Mountain may create further extension possibilities as lower cut off grades may now be economic.\nThe distribution of gold particles within the alluvial gravels at the Blue Mountain Project is currently not fully known. As drill samples represent small volumes of material, these initial results cannot be used for resource estimation or provide a definitive indication of grade variability until other work has been performed, including follow-up wash plant trials which are designed to determine the true gold content and potentially verify the drilling grades.\nFigure 1: Plan of Lower Patterson drill traverses showing extent of gold \u2265 0.15 g b.c.m\nNext Steps\n\u00d8\nECR has drilled two other similar-sized creek flats at the Blue Mountain Project, namely the Denny's Creek and Upper Kariboe areas, with results expected likely in October.\n\u00d8\nThe Company has received external interest in potential production partnerships, with preliminary discussions now in progress. There can, however, be no guarantee as to the conclusion of any such discussions, nor as to the timing or terms, structure or value of any such production partnership.\nBlue Mountain Gold Project\nThe Blue Mountain Gold Project is located in North Queensland within the historic goldfields of the region. The Blue Mountain Project area hosts extensive alluvial workings along the Kariboe Creek and its tributaries, much of which was only partially exploited by historic operators. The Board believes that ECR is the first company to undertake a modern systematic drilling programme across these alluvial channels, providing detailed information on gold distribution within the gravels.\nWith large volumes of alluvial material present, the Blue Mountain Project offers both near-term production potential and longer-term exploration upside, as the Company continues to assess the broader extent of ",

Importantly, coarse and heavy-textured gold was visually identified at the Upper Kariboe Creek, the first time such gold has been seen at the Blue Mountain Project.\nTrial wash testing of selected samples from the three prospects is planned to provide valuable data on potential recovery rates and average grades\n(see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Prospect Map, Blue Mountain Gold Project\nBlue Mountain Project\nThe Blue Mountain Project, located in the historic North Queensland goldfields, hosts extensive alluvial gold workings along the Kariboe Creek and its tributaries, many of which have seen only limited historic testing. ECR has implemented a systematic drilling programme across these channels to evaluate their potential for modern recovery, complemented by on-site trial washing to seek to verify results. With substantial volumes of alluvial gravels and the capability to conduct in-house processing trials, the Board considers that the Blue Mountain Project offers strong near-term production potential together with significant longer-term exploration upside.\nLolworth Project Drilling Programme\nThe drilling rig is currently en route to the Lolworth Project and will undergo servicing at Charters Towers before being moved onto site, with arrival expected next week.\nThe first drilling target will be the Uncle Terry prospect, where previous rock chip sampling and mapping confirmed galena, sulphides and high-grade gold assays, including grades of up to 75.6 g/t Au. Drilling will test quartz blow outcrops and shear zones that remain open along strike\n(see Figures 2 and 3).\nFigure 2: Rock Chip Results - Gorge Creek West\nFigure 3: Rock Chip Results - Uncle Terry Drill Target Outcrop\nLolworth Project\nThe Lolworth Project, also in North Queensland, is a large-scale gold and critical minerals exploration project. Previous sampling has confirmed high-grade gold, silver-lead (galena) mineralisation and rare earth element anomalies across multiple targets. The Lolworth Project covers an extensive area of prospective geology that has seen limited modern exploration, despite its strong mineral potential. Drilling at the Uncle Terry prospect will represent the first systematic drill testing at the Lolworth Project and is expected to provide valuable insights into the scale and continuity of mineralisation across the wider project area.\nECR's Chief Geologist, Adam Jones, commented:\n\"Our Queensland portfolio continues to stand out and deliver exciting results. At the Blue Mountain Project we have confirmed visible gold across several prospects, including coarse and heavy-textured gold at Upper Kariboe Creek, which we consider a significant milestone as we consider how to advance its near-term production potential. With the rig now moving to the Lolworth Project, we are due to drill some of the most prospective ground we have seen to date.

The Board believes that this zone has the potential to host between 35,000 and 40,000 bank cubic metres (\"b.c.m\") of gold-bearing gravels. Importantly, this area is connected to a series of upstream flats where drilling has also revealed visual gold over a further 170 metres in length by 17 metres wide, at depths of between one and three metres. The Board believes that this upstream section could potentially contain an additional 6,000 b.c.m of gravels.\nSamples from both the Lower Patterson flat and from the upstream flat have been dispatched to the laboratory for assay, with the first results expected later by early September 2025. In parallel, the Company is preparing a further batch of samples from the lower end of Denny's Gully (see Figure 2), where visual gold has once again been observed within the main alluvial channels. Once received, the laboratory results will assist the team in estimating gold grades across the project area.\nFigure 1\nFigure 2\nAs indicated in the Company's announcement of 4 August 2025, the team are\nremaining at the Blue Mountain Project for longer than planned in order to ensure that they fully optimise the use of the drill rig to map out areas of interest.\nWith the ongoing success from the drill rig, the move to the Lolworth Project has now been put back by another week. Once drilling at the Lolworth Project has commenced, which is now scheduled for the last week of August 2025, ECR intends to excavate representative material adjacent to the completed drilling at the Blue Mountain Project and run it through the trial wash plant. The purpose of this part of the programme is to test whether drilling results provide a reliable indication of grade by comparing sample data against recovered gold. The outcome of this work will provide important information to guide future exploration in relation to the extent of the tenement. Beyond the current drilling area, ECR also holds tenure covering a further prospective six kilometres of strike downstream along South Kariboe Creek, offering significant exploration upside.\nBlue Mountain Project\nThe Blue Mountain Gold Project is located in Queensland, Australia, within the historic North Queensland goldfields. The Blue Mountain Project is characterised by extensive alluvial gold workings along the Kariboe Creek and its tributaries, many of which were only partially tested by historic operations. ECR has established a systematic drilling programme across these alluvial channels to assess their potential for modern gold recovery, supported by on-site trial washing to calibrate and verify results. With the combination of extensive alluvial gravels and the Company's capacity to undertake trial processing, the Blue Mountain Project is viewed by the Board as having strong near-term production potential alongside its longer-term exploration upside.\nNext Steps\n\u00b7\nReceipt of initial laboratory assay results from the Blue Mountain Project.\n\u00b7\nCompletion of the current alluvial channel drilling programme covering 2.5km of strike.\n\u00b7\nCommencement of drilling at the Lolworth Project by end of the last week of August 2025.\n\u00b7\nTrial washing of representative Blue Mountain material to confirm drilling results and provide further insight into gold recovery potential.\n\u00b7\nEconomic evaluation of the Blue Mountain Project.\nNick Tulloch, Chairman of ECR Minerals, commented\n\"We continue to be very encouraged by our findings at the Blue Mountain Project and our decision to use the\npercussion drill rig for site investigations remains a success\n.

As noted in the Company's announcement on 8 October 2024, the Board considers that the Blue Mountain Project may be a viable commercial gold resource.\nUsing the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, ECR Digital Limited (\"\nECR Digital\n\"), ECR will hold a portion of its treasury reserves in digital assets, such as BTC or select high tier alternative digital coins, as either a partial hedge against fluctuations in gold prices or as a standalone store of value, which the Board views as effectively functioning as a modern form of digital inventory.\nFurthermore, as a UK headquartered company with Australian-based operations, the Board views currency management a core part of the Company's financial planning. In this regard, the Board believes that digital assets such as Bitcoin provides flexibility as a cross-border transactional currency.\nKey terms of the Policy:\n\u00b7\nUse of BTC for treasury management purposes:\nThe Board intends to invest no more than 50 per cent. of its free cash flows from gold production\n1\nto acquire BTC as a long-term treasury reserve. The Policy also provides that no more than 50 per cent. of surplus cash\n2\nheld by the Company may be used for BTC purchases. No speculative or leveraged trading of BTC or other digital assets is permitted, and the Company will not engage in derivatives or leveraged products that deviate from the goal of long-term asset holding.\n\u00b7\nCustody and security:\nThe Company will appoint a regulated custodian which is either registered by the Financial Conduct Authority (the \"\nFCA\n\") or regulated in its country of operation and the Policy prescribes a series of security protocols including mandatory storage in multi-signature wallets requiring at least two Board-approved signatories and the use of offline cold storage to minimise cyber risks.\n\u00b7\nApproved investment instruments:\nThe only approved instrument, investment or asset which the Company may hold, other than cash, is BTC. However, the Policy does give the Board discretion to select a list of high tier alternative digital assets which may comprise up to 15 per cent. of its available 50 per cent. treasury allocation headroom provided that such assets are capable of generating a yield (for example, Ethereum). Any yield generated must then be utilised to acquire additional BTC or other Board approved high tier alternative digital assets taking into account the Company's available 50 per cent. treasury allocation headroom.\n\u00b7\nSupervision, responsibilities and control framework:\nThe Company will appoint a treasury committee, comprising at least one non-executive director, the financial controller and the chairman, who will be responsible for administering and reviewing adherence to the Policy on a quarterly basis.\nThe full Policy is available on the Company's investor relations website at:\nhttps://ecrminerals.com/investors/aim-rule-26/\n.\nRisks associated with the Policy:\nWhile the Board recognises that the acquisition of digital assets, including BTC, may provide benefits (as outlined above), it also acknowledges the inherent risks associated with such assets. Digital assets, including BTC, are highly volatile as well as speculative in nature and are subject to significant price fluctuations. In addition, it should be noted that a growing number of publicly traded companies have adopted digital asset focused treasury strategies, and this has sometimes resulted in significant volatility in their share price and a dislocation between their market capitalisation and the underlying value of their assets. Consequently, exposure to digital assets such as BTC may, in turn, amongst other matters, compound and increase the volatility of the Company's share price.\nTo mitigate these risks, the Company intends to allocate no more than 50 per cent. of its free cash flow from gold production operations1 and surplus cash2 held by the Company towards principally the acquisition and holding of BTC, the most liquid digital asset, into treasury.\nThe Board also acknowledges that the regulatory environment for digital assets remains uncertain and subject to change. This may impact the Company's ability to hold or transact in digital assets, including BTC. There are also risks associated with custody, security, and the accoun",

Taking advantage of the drill rig travelling through Queensland, the Company is carrying out some reconnaissance drilling at the Blue Mountain project in Queensland, Australia (the \"\nBlue Mountain Project\n\"). This strategy has paid dividends. With holes circa 6m deep and around 5m apart and drilling time at around 20 minutes per hole, including movement of the drill rig and set up, the Company has been able to quickly drill and assess prospective areas at the Blue Mountain Project.\nDrill samples are catalogued, panned and inspected for signs of visible gold before sending appropriate samples to the lab for further analysis.\nBy way of illustration, during the past week, ECR has identified and mapped a potentially suitable area considered for future commercial production in the form of a large creek flat. This area, which is previously un-mined, shows positive visible gold in the form of drill chips over an area measuring roughly 200m in length, 27m in width and up to 3m in depth. Samples are currently being prepared for laboratory analysis with the results expected to be used to assess the design of exploration trenches. Here, the estimated 16,200 cubic metres with an assumed project grade of 0.6 grammes per bank cubic metre and the current gold spot price of approximately US$3,290 represents a potential gold value in situ of over US$1.1 million. The speed and precision by which this area has been assessed was considerably advanced by the drilling programme. This area represents just a small fraction of the potentially mineable zones across the Blue Mountain Project. In addition, this illustrates not only the potential financial scale of the Blue Mountain Project but also the speed at which ECR is able to assess its viability.\nDuring last week, ECR's chairman, Nick Tulloch, and chief geologist, Adam Jones, also conducted a review of the Blue Mountain Project to assess the areas to be drilled. With the scale of the Blue Mountain Project area being extensive, management decided to keep the drill rig on site at the Blue Mountain Project for the time being to continue operations. The drill rig will move up to the Lolworth Project later this month.\nEarlier this year, ECR published an illustration that the Blue Mountain Project may be capable of generating monthly revenues of approximately A$470,000 (US$295,000). This potential revenue illustration assumes an average grade of 0.6 grammes per bank cubic metre and Gekko Systems Pty Limited's projected 91.7% gold recovery rate, with a wash plant with a 25 tonne per hour capacity, to provide prospective output per month of over 3,000 grammes (over 100 ounces), using a gold price of US$2,790 per ounce.\nWe are pleased to report that subsequent work continues to support the above illustration, albeit it now equates to potential monthly revenues of approximately A$544,000 (US$350,000) when using an updated gold price of US$3,290 per ounce. More particularly, the work to date has increased the Company's confidence in using higher capacity wash plants and the table below illustrates the potential scale up that could be achieved.\nIllustrative monthly revenue and production at the Blue Mountain Project\nAlluvial gold recovery is highly sensitive to the rate at which material can be processed. The above illustration is based on a wash plant with a 25 tonne per hour capacity but the scale of the Blue Mountain Project would potentially support a larger plant, subject to a suitable design and the availability of sufficient water. Management will continue to examine the feasibility of such plants and have already had a preliminary discussion with the landowner regarding constructing a dam as part of the project. The table below illustrates how any potential revenue, and commercial production would scale up with a larger plant (with all other assumptions above remaining the same).\nWash plant capacity (per hour)\n25 tonnes\n40 tonnes\n50 tonnes\n60 tonnes\nMonthly revenue\nA$544,000\nA$871,000\nA$1,088,000\nA$1,306,000\nGold (grammes)\n3,347\n5,355\n6,694\n8,033\nGold (ounces)\n118\n189\n236\n283\nInvestors should note that the above figures are illustrative of the Blue Mountain Project's potential based on the assumptions stated and the potential commercial production should not be consider",

Realising value from these tax losses is still very much on our agenda but we will not let them go cheaply and we will weigh up any third party offer against the value that ECR itself can obtain from them via its proposed production plans.\n\"This latter point is most important. The development of Blue Mountain gives ECR, for the first time in its history, a clear line of sight on revenues and, with the prevailing strength in the gold price, a meaningful expectation of value. If that project performs as we expect it to, then the economic savings from utilising our tax losses there have the potential to considerably exceed the value that we may realise by selling our tax losses. Alongside Blue Mountain, promising results elsewhere in our operations, alongside forthcoming exploration activities, provide further encouragement in relation to future financial performance. But we are also mindful of the costs of developing production and we will look carefully at all approaches for the tax losses which, if structured appropriately, may provide a significant source of funding.\n\"The next two months in particular marks a pivotal moment for ECR. Our work in Queensland got underway this week and in the immediate term our eyes are on Blue Mountain where we are carrying out a shallow drilling programme and wash plant prototype testing to determine the process for moving to large scale alluvial mining at the project. From there the team will move 1,000 km north to Lolworth with the rig to target the high-grade gold and rare earth prospects that our surface exploration has pointed to.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 02 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 3328 5656\nNominated Adviser\nNick Naylor / Alex Brearley / Vivek Bhardwaj\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 203 026 0320\nBroker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nBroker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nI am pleased to present ECR's interim results for the six months ended 31 March 2025.\nThe period began with our announcement in October 2024 of highly encouraging results from the enhanced gold recovery process at our Blue Mountain project in Queensland. Working with Gekko Systems Pty Limited (\"Gekko\")\n, we have\ndemonstrated a recovery rate of 91.7% gold\ninto 0.40% of the mass\u00a0and suggesting that the ore located at the Blue Mountain Project is suitable for gravity concentration using a batch centrifugal concentrator. We said at the time that, if these results are repeatable across the Blue Mountain project area, then ECR might have a commercial project.

The Board believes that these developments mark key milestones in advancing the Company's future exploration and production objectives.\nHighlights\nBlue Mountain\n\u2022 Drilling rig to be mobilised with bulk sampling and prototype wash plant testing ongoing, with the objective to demonstrate recovery and revenue potential\n\u2022 Expanded work programme to assess larger-capacity wash plant and production partnerships, aiming to support long-term operational scalability\nLolworth\n\u2022 Drill-ready gold targets defined at Gorge Creek West, Uncle Terry, and Gorge Diggings, with drilling set to commence in July 2025\nBlue Mountain Project\nThe Blue Mountain Project is advancing rapidly, with a contracted drilling rig set to be mobilised and moving to site before the end of June 2025. ECR's Chief Geologist, Adam Jones, and the technical team are expected to arrive on site by 23 June 2025 with a fully modified wash plant prototype and are expected to immediately commence operations. This phase will focus on bulk sampling and testing our revised wash plant modifications to optimise the Company's future alluvial mining model. This is expected to provide critical data on gold recovery and revenue potential. The drilling programme is specifically designed to test the depth to bedrock to enable a clearer understanding of the project's geological potential. Holes are envisaged to be of 3 - 5 metres depth on gridlines across the core areas of the alluvial resource. No representative sampling program is envisaged but the presence of alluvial gold will be logged to guide the program. The bulk sampling campaign will analyse the expansion, scalability, and recovery potential of the project, with drilling also targeted at areas where ECR intends, in due course, to commence operations. These efforts are a critical step in advancing towards production, de-risking the project, and building confidence in its long-term commercial viability.\nThe team has also scheduled a review of a larger-capacity wash plant and associated heavy equipment at a nearby location, aligning with ECR's strategy to scale operations and explore production partnerships.\nLolworth Gold and Rare Earths Project\nECR is also preparing for an exploration campaign, in what is targeted to be a significant advance at Lolworth, that is expected to take place between July and August 2025. Following extensive soil and stream sampling, drill-ready gold targets have been identified at Gorge Creek West, Uncle Terry, and Gorge Diggings, with Butterfly Creek as a potential additional target. A minimum of 1,500 metres of percussion drilling is planned, using a rig capable of 100 millimetre diameter holes to depths of at least 100 metres. The programme, set to commence in mid-July and conclude in August 2025, will focus on near-surface gold mineralisation up to depths of 70 metres depth, optimising cost-effective intercept density. Previous surface sampling at Uncle Terry returned grades of up to 75.6 g/t Au, with accompanying silver-lead mineralisation.\nECR continues its collaboration with James Cook University and the Queensland Geological Department's Critical Minerals division to advance rare earth elements (REE) exploration, with a focus on Niobium-Tantalum mineralisation at Oaky Creek and the ridgeline zone, where past sampling yielded results up to 146 ppm Nb. Historical alluvial mining evidence suggests significant downstream gold potential, which remains untested by modern exploration methods, which the Board believes present a compelling opportunity for exploration.\nCharters Towers Presentation\nECR's Chief Geologist, Adam Jones, will present the Company's Queensland portfolio at the regional exploration forum in Charters Towers on 28 June 2025. This event will highlight recent achievements and strategic objectives, reinforcing ECR's growing presence in this historically productive mining region.\nCorporate Update\nECR remains on budget and on schedule across its operations. Importantly, the under-budget completion of the recent Bailieston drilling campaign has provided flexibility to accelerate activities in Queensland. Final results from the antimony drilling programme at Bailieston are expected in the shorter-term.\nThe progress from our recent projects is increasing the awareness of ECR in Australia with both prospective counterparties and investors. We are reinforcing this by renaming our two Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Limited and ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Limit",

The programme has confirmed the presence of both gold and antimony mineralisation in two of the first three drill holes completed.\nA total of approximately 570 metres of drilling has now been completed across four holes\n(BH3DD044 to BH3DD047).\nThe final hole,\nBH3DD047, was completed on 27 May 2025 with core samples in the process of being submitted to the laboratory for analysis this week.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nAntimony mineralisation intersected in two of the first three holes\n(BH3DD044 and BH3DD046).\n\u00b7\nBH3DD046 returned 0.15m @ 0.84 g/t Au and 1.62% Sb, both from 135.2m.\n\u00b7\nBH3DD044 intersected a 1.6m mineralised zone from 133.0m, including 0.2m @ 3.86 g/t Au and 1.41% Sb from 133.5m, as well as 0.3m @ 3.09 g/t Au from 133.7m.\n\u00b7\nVisual confirmation of stibnite (antimony sulphide) throughout the drilling interval.\nOverview of Drilling Results\n(See Figures 1+2 and Tables 1+2)\nFollowing the Company's announcement on 14 April 2025, a four-hole diamond drilling programme has now been completed at the Company's Bailieston Project. The programme intersected gold and antimony mineralisation in two of the first three holes (BH3DD044 and BH3DD046).\nHole BH3DD044 delivered promising results, intersecting a 1.6m mineralised zone from 133.0m, including 0.2m @ 3.86 g/t Au and 1.41% Sb from 133.5m, yielding a gold equivalent grade (AuEq) of 7.62 g/t at 133.5m (based on A$3,500/oz gold and A$30,000/t antimony prices), and 0.3m @ 3.09 g/t Au from 133.7m, with visual confirmation of stibnite (antimony sulphide) throughout this interval. Additionally, a shallower intercept in BH3DD044 returned 0.2m @ 0.92 g/t Au from 61.3m.\nHole BH3DD046 intersected 0.15m @ 0.84 g/t Au and 1.62% Sb from 135.2m.\nHole BH3DD045 intersected the intended structure. However, the quartz vein had pinched out, limiting mineralised potential in that section, and no significant gold or antimony intercepts have been reported from the intervals tested from that drill hole.\nThe final hole, BH3DD047, was completed on 27 May 2025 with core samples in the process of being submitted to the laboratory for analysis this week and the Company will update on the results from this in due course.\nThe drilling programme thus far has successfully intersected the targeted mineralised structures within three metres of predicted depths, with the structural orientation closely aligning with a previous high-grade intercept in hole BH3DD019, which returned 0.3m at 32% Sb, reinforcing the potential of the mineralised system.\nFigure 1: Plan of Drilling and Results to Date\nFigure 2: Presence of Stibnite (1.4% Sb) in hole BH3DD044\nTable 1: Average grades of mineralisation for significant intercepts and depths of zones tested for Antimony-Gold Target Zones\nDrill Hole\nFrom\nTo\nLength\nAu g/t\nSb %\nBH3DD044\n133\n133.5\n0.5\n0.55\nBH3DD044\n133.5\n133.7\n0.2\n3.86\n1.41\nBH3DD044\n133.7\n134\n0.3\n3.09\nBH3DD044\n134\n134.6\n0.6\n0.25\nBH3DD046\n135.2\n135.35\n0.15\n0.84\n1.62\nBH3DD046\n135.35\n135.55\n0.2\n0.23\nTable 2: Average grades of mineralisation for significant intercepts and depths of zones tested for additional Gold-Only Zones\nDrill Hole\nFrom\nTo\nLength\nAu g/t\nComment\nBH3DD044\n61.3\n61.5\n0.2\n0.92\n100mm thick quartz vein\nBH3DD044\n89\n89.75\n0.75\n0.13\nMineralised dyke and veining\nBH3DD044\n89.75\n89.93\n0.18\n1.13\nBH3DD044\n89.93\n90.15\n0.22\n1.42\nBH3DD044\n90.15\n90.7\n0.55\n0.38\nBH3DD044\n90.7\n91.75\n1.05\n0.19\nBH3DD045\n129.5\n129.8\n0.3\n0.15\nNarrow quartz vein within shear\nBH3DD046\n135.2\n135.35\n0.15\n0.84\nShear zone (Target)\nBH3DD046\n135.35\n135.55\n0.2\n0.23\nHole BH3DD045 (Hole 2) intersected the intended structure.

Maximus is the owner of three properties in Ontario, Canada and has an option to acquire a license over a fourth property also in Ontario\n.\nDuring the due diligence phase of the proposed acquisition, it became apparent to ECR that there are certain unforeseen structural challenges regarding Maximus that will increase the complications of successfully concluding any such transaction and thereby detract from its potential value to ECR. As a result, the board of directors of ECR has determined that it is not in shareholders' best interests to continue discussions with\nMaximus\n.\nAll of the due diligence in relation to\nMaximus\nto date was conducted personally by ECR's management team. Consequently, no professional fees or legal expenses have been incurred by ECR.\nNick Tulloch, Chairman of ECR, said:\n\"Naturally it is disappointing when a proposed transaction does not proceed. However, we will not compromise our guiding principles of only pursuing projects that are the best strategic fit for ECR and have a high probability of delivering value to our shareholders and preserving our cash resources for ongoing development of our projects.\n\"We wish the Maximus team well in their future plans and we will continue to be receptive to opportunities that may advance ECR's strategic objectives. During the course of this year, we have already received and examined several other prospects. In some cases, our investigations remain ongoing, and we will make further announcements if we determine that any of these should be advanced further.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 02 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser\nNick Naylor / Alex Brearley / Vivek Bhardwaj\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nBroker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nBroker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company.

It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 2025 annual general meeting of ECR Minerals plc. I am delighted to begin by highlighting our strengthened financial position, secured through a successful \u00a3950,000 fundraising announced in November 2024 and further reinforced by the sale of the Company's surplus land at Brewing Lane in Victoria, Australia for A$225,000. These additional funds ensures that ECR is fully equipped to execute our ambitious 2025 work programmes.\nI wish to extend my sincere appreciation to the board of directors of ECR (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") for their continued commitment to receiving a significant portion of their remuneration in ECR ordinary shares of 0.001 pence each (\"Ordinary Shares\"), a policy which is now over halfway through its second year and which has been\u00a0instrumental in preserving the Company's cash resources.\nThe market for junior exploration companies remains undeniably tough with limited access to capital creating significant challenges for many of our peers. Yet ECR stands out, well-positioned to advance our\u00a0projects without the immediate need for additional fundraising, a testament to our continued prudent financial management and strategic focus.\nTurning to our operations, we are advancing our projects at a time when gold and antimony prices are hitting record highs. This very favourable market backdrop enhances the potential of our portfolio.\nAt our Bailieston Gold and Antimony project in Central Victoria, Australia (the \"Bailieston Project\") a diamond core drill rig is anticipated to arrive this week, with drilling expected to commence imminently. Historical soil sampling has identified four\nin-situ\nantimony anomalies at the Bailieston Project. In addition, recent rock chip sampling suggested antimony at the surface, with 34 samples returning antimony grades between 0.25% and 1.91% supporting our best result of a 32% antimony grade over 0.3 metres (hole 19) from previous drilling. With strong antimony and gold prices driving renewed exploration in Victoria's Costerfield Bailieston-Nagambie corridor, these results, alongside substantial antimony resources that have been reported nearby, have generated significant interest in our Bailieston Project.\nAdditionally, our tax losses held within our wholly-owned subsidiary, Mercator Gold Australia Pty Ltd (\"MGA\"), continues to attract increased attention, with new parties signing non-disclosure agreements (\"NDAs\") to access our data room. We have also been approached by a third party interested in a potential collaboration for the development of our Creswick project. While discussions remain early-stage, we will update shareholders should discussions progress further.\nIn Queensland, our Blue Mountain Project (the \"Blue Mountain Project\") offers the potential for a significant near-term revenue opportunity, with production targeted to start later this year. Earlier testing by Gekko Systems Pty Limited (\"Gekko\") on ore samples collected at the Blue Mountain Project demonstrated a recovery rate of 91.7% gold into 0.40% of the mass, suggesting the ore's suitability for gravity concentration using a batch centrifugal concentrator. A further bulk sampling campaign will aim to validate our operating and financial model before potentially moving into production. We are projecting monthly revenues of approximately A$470,000 (US$295,000) from the Blue Mountain Project, based on a 0.6 g/BCM grade, a 25 tonnes per hour wash plant, and a gold price of US$2,790 per ounce. Dual wash plants could further boost output and of course with gold prices more than 15% up on the levels used in our feasibility assessment, the returns are well underpinned. The estimated costs for the work programme and wash plant are included in our 2025 budget.\nAt our Lolworth Gold and Rare Earths project, we are focusing on five promising gold prospects with our first drilling campaign planned there for mid-2025.\nECR has numerous opportunities to deliver significant value for our shareholders in 2025 and beyond. I extend my sincere thanks to our shareholders for their support through challenging market conditions. As we advance our projects, we remain committed to rigorous cost control. I look forward to sharing further progress with you soon.\"\nReview of Announcement by Qualified Person\nThis announcement has been reviewed by\u00a0Adam Jones, Chief Geologist at\u00a0ECR Minerals Plc.\u00a0Adam Jones\u00a0is a professional geologist and is a Member of the\u00a0Australian Institute of Geoscientists\u00a0(MAIG).

On 3 July 2024, ECR's Bailieston Project sampling uncovered high-grade antimony, with hole BH3DD019 hitting 32% Sb over 0.3m and BH3DD027 yielding 1.2% Sb over 0.1m. ECR is now finalising plans for a follow-up diamond drilling programme to investigate these targets further.\nRecent field work (See Table 1)\nECR's geology team has recently reviewed historical portable x-ray fluorescence (\"PXRF\") data from soil sampling campaigns conducted at the Bailieston Project\nbetween 2020 and 2022. Statistical analysis defined eight sub-populations of increasing antimony values. These were then spatially correlated with known mineralised vein systems, revealing four key antimony anomalies along the Hardup, Hardup South, Scanlons and Scoulars veins.\nTo verify the soil sampling results 72 rock chip samples were collected from oxidised, veined and sheared material within historical trenches and pits. Seven of these were\nin-situ\nchannel samples taken across exposed mineralised structures\n.\nSummary of key rock chip sample results include:\n\u25cf\n0.3m @ 41.3 g/t Au, 0.89% Sb\n\u25cf\n0.5m @ 36.1 g/t Au, 0.48% Sb\n\u25cf\n0.31m @ 10.6 g/t Au, 1.13% Sb\n\u25cf\n0.8m @ 6.51 g/t Au, 0.19% Sb\nThese samples were all taken from the Hardup Reef, part of a north-northeast trending vein system that has seen limited modern exploration. Given the current commodity price environment, these high-grade zones represent compelling drill targets.\nDrill targets (See Figure 1)\nECR has completed internal and external structural interpretations of prior diamond drilling campaigns (2021-2022), focusing on the standout antimony intercept in hole BH3DD019. The results suggest that the main Maori-Bailieston anticline has undergone eastward rollover at a key inflection point, creating a zone of structural dilation-or 'bulge' -that may host significant antimony and gold mineralisation.\nFour diamond drillholes are now budgeted to test this target zone, with planned depths ranging between 100m to 180m.

With rock chip and soil anomalies aligning with high-grade historical intercepts, our upcoming drill programme is designed to test this 'bulge' zone directly.

There is considerable cause for optimism as we enter 2025. We will continue to investigate the potential to bring Blue Mountain into production, whilst also advancing our other assets.

Holes 43, 34, and 42 are adjacent to this zone. Hole 43, located 50 metres south of the antimony vein, also delivered the Company's best gold drilling intercept to date at the Bailieston Project -four metres at 9 g/t gold. Hole 43 is yet to be followed up with further drilling.\nField teams have now successfully completed a rock chip sampling program with results expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Initial Portable X-Ray Fluorescence (\"PXRF\") analysis has identified surface expressions of antimony (\"Sb\"), consistent with historical workings and mapped shear zones, further reinforcing the Bailieston Project's antimony prospectivity.\nECR intends to launch a targeted drilling campaign at the Bailieston Project to define the extent of antimony mineralisation, with drilling scheduled to commence in April 2025.\nCorporate Update\nECR continues to evaluate opportunities to optimise value across its asset portfolio. Since the update provided on 28 February 2025, the Company has received additional third-party interest in the tax losses held by Mercator Gold Australia Pty Ltd (\"MGA\") and certain non-core assets, excluding the EL5433 licence, which encompasses the Bailieston Antimony project.\nAs previously announced, any disposal of MGA may be considered to be a fundamental change of business pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies. If applicable, this would require, amongst other items, the proposed disposal of MGA to be conditional on the consent of the Company's shareholders being given in a general meeting, the publication of a shareholder circular detailing the terms of the transaction and certain other disclosures as set out in the AIM Rules. There can be no guarantee as to the conclusion of any agreement for the disposal of MGA, nor as to the timing or final terms, structure or value of any such transaction. Any transaction involving the Company's tax losses would likely be coupled with a restructuring of MGA, as indicated in the Company's previous announcements.\nQueensland\nIn Queensland, development at the Blue Mountain Gold project continues with technical and geological activities advancing in line with management's expectations. The current focus includes mapping out the optimal trenching location using drones or ground-penetrating radar, ensuring access to water via on-site creeks and implementing water recovery plans. The current development proposal involves a larger wash plant being commissioned, either custom-built or purchased and modified for the Blue Mountain Gold Project, with suitable suppliers identified.\nA bulk testing campaign will aim to validate the Company's financial modelling before potentially moving to production. The Blue Mountain Gold Project is estimated by ECR to have an indicative revenue potential of approximately A$470,000 (US$295,000) monthly, based on a 0.6 g/BCM grade, a 25 tonnes per hour wash plant, and a gold price of US$2,790 per ounce. This could potentially increase with dual wash plants and the current higher gold price.\nThe Blue Mountain Gold Project, an alluvial gold system, requires lower capital expenditure compared to other gold projects. The deepest trench was four metres, with the best recovery at 1.5 metres. The estimated costs for the 2025 work programme and wash plant are within management's budget and current cash resources.\nAt Lolworth, ECR has secured a drill rig, with drilling anticipated to commence towards the end of H1 2025.\nFinancial Position\nECR remains well-funded, strengthened by the receipt of A$225,000 from the recent sale of the Brewing Lane property as announced on 5 March 2025. This strategic divestment enhances the Company's balance sheet and ensures that it is well-capitalised to advance exploration across its portfolio and bring the Blue Mountain Gold Project potentially into production.\nMike Whitlow, ECR's Managing Director, said\n:\n\"We're excited to be moving forward with the upcoming antimony drilling program at our Bailieston Project, scheduled to begin next month. The recent rock chip sampling and PXRF analysis has highlighted the promising potential of the tenement, and w",

The Proposed Acquisition is subject to the satisfactory conclusion of ECR's due diligence and completion of underlying transaction documentation by 31 May 2025.\nMaximus is the owner of three properties in Ontario, Canada and has an option to acquire a license over a fourth property also in Ontario (the \"\nCat Key Project\n\").\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nProposed Acquisition of Maximus for \u00a3500,000 which owns 100% of three base metal projects in Ontario, Canada with copper, zinc and gold showings\n\u00b7\nProposed that following completion of the Proposed Acquisition, ECR will also exercise Maximus' option to acquire the Cat Key Project for an additional C$600,000 (c. \u00a3329,000)\n\u00b7\nWork to date on the Cat Key Project would provide ECR with a drill ready opportunity at economic cost to progress towards a resource estimate\n\u00b7\nTotal area of 71.36 sq km across the four properties, all of which are accessible by road all year-round\n\u00b7\nProposed activities on the Maximus properties and the Cat Key Project are not expected to materially alter ECR's existing budgeted expenditure or change funding requirements\n\u00b7\nExclusivity granted until 31 May 2025 to conclude due diligence and complete transaction documentation\n\u00b7\nConsideration for both the Proposed Acquisition and the exercise of the option to acquire the Cat Key Project is to be satisfied through the issue of new ordinary shares of 0.001 pence each in ECR (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\")\n\u00b7\nAll new Ordinary Shares are to be issued at not less than 0.33 pence each, being the price equal to the issue price of the Company's subscription announced on 25 November 2024\n\u00b7\nC$406,245 (c. \u00a3223,000) of exploration credits at the Cat Key Project will transfer to ECR in the event that the option is exercised\nNick Tulloch, Chairman of ECR, said:\n\"We have voiced our ambition to expand ECR on several occasions and, alongside developing our own projects, we have examined several potential opportunities, always adopting strict criteria to ensure that we best position ECR to strive to deliver value to shareholders.\n\"Maximus, with its three existing base metal projects and the option over the advanced high-grade gold Cat Key Project, fulfils these criteria. Completion of the Proposed Acquisition will provide ECR with both a geographical and project expansion, taking our assets beyond Australia and beyond gold, whilst still utilising the skills of the team. The Proposed Acquisition will provide ECR with a ready-made vehicle to commence operations in Canada.\n\"Importantly the work done to date on Maximus' properties provides considerable guidance for near term operations, which we believe can be carried out with little change to our existing budgeted plans. The Cat Key Project in particular would provide an opportunity for the Company to develop a gold resource based on the results from historic drilling.\n\"The Proposed Acquisition and the associated option over the Cat Key Project have been structured via all-equity consideration, consistent with our policy of preserving our cash resources for ongoing development of our projects.\"\nFurther information on Maximus\nMaximus, through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary Maximus Minerals Inc, owns licences over three properties - Cavern Lake, Silver Lake, Chapman Copper - and an option (the \"\nOption\n\") to acquire a fourth licence, being the Cat Key Project, from\nNuVision Resources ULC (\"\nNuVision\"\n)\n. Maximus is currently owned by a number of shareholders, with the largest being Stirling Bridge Resources Limited.\nCat Key Project\nThe Cat Key Project, which is considered by the board of directors of ECR (the \"\nBoard\n\" or the \"\nDirectors\n\") to be the most attractive asset within Maximus via the Option, is a 27.76 sq. km property consisting of 243 single-cell claims accessible via the east-west paved Highway 11 and is located 280 km west of Thunder Bay, Ontario and 50 km east of Fort Frances near the village of Mine Centre.\nMine Centre has been a focus of gold, base metal (Cu-Zn and Cu-Ni-PGM) and iron-titanium exploration since the 1890s having produced 25,000 ounces of gold and 3,000 ounces of silver from mining activities at the turn of the century.\nThe previous operator of the Cat Key Project property has outlined the 350 metre 'Bush Rat' zone. This consists of a 3-15 metre wide silicate-anke",

The proposed target completion date of the sale of MGA, as suggested by Octo, was 28 February 2025 to enable Octo to conclude other agreements, independent of ECR, that it is engaged in. In this regard, the Board of directors (\"Board\" or \"Directors\") consider that Octo has not made satisfactory progress in relation to being able to proceed with the proposed transaction and consequently ECR has written to Octo terminating the non-binding heads of terms between the two parties.\nDuring the discussions with Octo, ECR continued to attract interest in MGA from additional parties. As well as the appeal of the tax losses held by MGA, MGA is also the owner of three of the Company's tenements in Victoria, including the Bailieston gold and antimony exploration project. It was proposed that on or before completion of the proposed disposal of MGA to Octo, ECR would effect a reorganisation of MGA such that the only exploration assets remaining within MGA would be the Bailieston project. With rising gold prices, and more particularly, rising antimony prices as well as growing global interest in the strategic importance of these metals, the Board believes that MGA's, Bailieston tenement, represents an attractive possible strategic purchase as a potentially valuable asset in its own right.\nWith the non-binding heads of terms previously agreed with Octo now terminated, ECR's Board has determined to widen discussions on the potential sale of MGA to include other interested parties. Based on the preliminary enquiries received, it is apparent that the interest in MGA and its assets is both extensive and varied and ECR will therefore take this opportunity to re-examine the optimum structure of any potential sale of MGA.\nRules on transferring tax losses in Australia are complicated with the overriding consideration being that tax losses will always belong to the company in which they were incurred (MGA in this instance) and the transfer of that company needs to be by way of an operating entity (i.e. the company needs to have activities in addition to the tax losses for a third party to be able to make use of them). Octo's preference was for MGA's operations to comprise Bailieston. However, in the intervening period and as described further below, ECR's Board has reassessed Bailieston's potential value in light of the ongoing price strength in the antimony market.\nIt is possible therefore that any potential sale of MGA could be restructured to comprise other tenements within the Company, thereby enabling ECR to retain Bailieston (or the more prospective areas within the Bailieston project area).\nAs previously announced, any disposal of MGA may be considered to be a fundamental change of business pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies. If applicable, this would require, amongst other items, the proposed disposal of MGA to be conditional on the consent of the Company's shareholders being given in a general meeting, the publication of a shareholder circular detailing the terms of the transaction and certain other disclosures as set out in the AIM Rules. There can be no guarantee as to the conclusion of any agreement for the disposal of MGA, nor as to the timing or final terms, structure or value of any such transaction.\nThe Company will provide further updates as appropriate.\nAntimony drilling campaign at Bailieston\nOn 3 July 2024, ECR announced the results of additional testing for antimony of diamond core samples from Bailieston drilled during 2021-2022. The best results included 0.3 metres grading 32% Sb (Antimony) and 0.1 metres grading 1.20% Sb and a total of 12 samples returned results greater than 0.1% S",

In addition to these ongoing discussions, ECR has experienced a notable increase in interest in MGA from additional parties. As announced on 23 December 2024, under the contemplated proposed disposal structure, it is anticipated that the Bailieston gold and antimony exploration project will remain in MGA and therefore would be included in a proposed disposal of MGA. The Directors believe that this heightened interest in MGA comes amid rising antimony prices in certain markets and growing global interest in the strategic importance of the metal.\nSeveral new parties have recently joined the data room, and the Company continues to receive unsolicited enquiries, both directly and indirectly through its advisers. Following the Company's announcement on 3 February 2025, ECR confirms that additional confidentiality agreements have been signed with two interested parties this week, bringing the total number of such agreements to six.\nNotwithstanding this increased interest in MGA from other parties, the Company confirms that ECR and Octo are actively working towards finalising the proposed disposal, on the basis announced on 3 February 2025, of MGA ahead of Octo's proposed target completion date of 28 February 2025.\nThe heads of terms between ECR and Octo are not exclusive and are not binding in relation to the terms of the proposed disposal of MGA, and that this would be subject, among other things, to due diligence by Octo and the execution of a legally binding agreement governing the transaction.\nWhilst there can be no guarantee as to the conclusion of any agreement for the disposal of MGA, nor as to the timing or final terms or value of any such transaction, the board of directors of ECR remains encouraged by the significant interest shown in this potentially valuable asset.\nAs previously announced, any disposal of MGA may be considered to be a fundamental change of business pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies. If applicable, this would require, amongst other items, the proposed disposal of MGA to be conditional on the consent of the Company's shareholders being given in a general meeting, the publication of a shareholder circular detailing the terms of the transaction and certain other disclosures as set out in the AIM Rules. The Company will provide further updates as appropriate.\nBackground to Tax Losses\nThe Company's tax losses are held within MGA and have been accumulated since 2006. Any transaction involving these tax losses would be coupled with a restructuring of MGA, as indicated in the Company's announcement of 23 December 2024.\nECR Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"\nWhile our discussions with Octo remain advanced and our priority, the increasing number of parties seeking to engage with us highlights the significant potential of these assets. We believe that the pricing of antimony and heightened global demand is driving fresh attention to the Bailieston gold and antimony exploration project in Victoria\n.\nWe remain committed to securing the best possible outcome for our shareholders.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 1738 317 693\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\nEmail:\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser\nNick Naylor / Alex Brearley / Vivek Bhardwaj\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nBroker\nBen Tadd /\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nBroker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company.

As we've been told everything needed is there on site, so I'm more optimistic that the production process is already underway. The team have been on the ground for two weeks or more, and the weather has been fine. I've been checking the local weather regularly and its been largely clear with a few showers, but nothing dramatic, the heavier rain has been in the far North..about 500kms away, so no real delays due to weather. https://www.bom.gov.au/location/australia/queensland It's early morning over there as I post, approaching 7am, and clear. It's not as though they are running a dry blower where any moisture would clog up the process...it's a washplant which relies on water. NT said it was not going to be 0 - 60 in 3 days, but as the days go on they will become more efficient in making the process faster. As long as the first production RNS shows some half decent gold recovery then the market should be happy enough for further rises. If they don't show much in the first couple of weeks then maybe an over reaction very short term sell off could create a great entry back in the low 0.2p's! Exciting times...with \u00a31.5m in the bank so no chance of running out of funds.",

          "content": "The Raglan Project The Raglan Project lies approximately 40 minutes west of Gladstone, Queensland, close to mechanical services and infrastructure. The lease has historically produced coarse, nuggety gold and test pits excavated duringthe due diligence confirmed recoveries from both upper gravels and deeper bedrock wash. Mining at the Raglan Project to date has been largely small scale with several untested areas and depths within the property area. The due diligence site visit was conducted by ECR's Chief Geologist, Adam Jones, who assessed the mining lease, plant and equipment, and overall development potential. The equipment, including the gravity processing plant, was tested during the due diligence and found to be in good working order. Equally importantly, the test pits that were processed earlier this week yielded quantities of gold that the Board believes supports the commercial potential of the Raglan Project. The pits were dug in different parts of the property and the recovery from them, coupled with exploration upside observed on site, confirms to the Board that the Raglan Project has the potential to be a valuable asset for the Company. Around three quarters of the gold produced during ECR's due diligence was in small nuggets (up to 0.5 gramme pieces) with the Raglan Project's fine gravity concentrator recovering the balance as fine gold. The gold produced during the due diligence at Raglan was coarse, often with sharp edges potentially indicating a local source. Similarly, some particles of gold were observed attached to quartz, also indicating that a local source of the gold may be in the upper part of the lease area. ******************** This was why they bought it, and now the team are on the ground bringing home the booty!",

For those not aquainted with how the Gold systems work, there will be a source, where the Gold accumulated over millions of years. And as erosion took hold, and the source got dispersed via rivers and movement in the Earths plates and rocks etc. So any Gold that has travelled a long distance from its source gets worn down and smoothed in to shiny round pieces. If it hasn't travelled far from its source ie, the elephant...as its known, then it hasn't had the time and geology to smooth its edges...hence sharp and nuggety!! Imagine if they identify the source!!! 100 bagger overnight! caveat....I'm just speculating and pondering the thought...but if they've already come across nuggety course Gold with sharp edges...just in their due diligence process!!!

When they need to purchase more equipment to run the two site the increased revenue/production will easily cover the cost in a couple of months.....I don't know how they've let anything slip as they've never said no additional equipment will be required to run two sites. Regarding funding , yes I would expect money to be spent on drilling....how else are they going to prove up Lolworth? We will also be getting revenue in from Raglan which will be topping up the coffers.. Still the BB clown (laughing at you, not with you)",

The thing is, these types of pointless FUDsters are on every share chat...they feed off of reaction and engagement to their negative made up nonsence. They try to create a chaotic atmosphere in the conversation, always trying new negative threads to seed some doubt and uncertainty. The only thing that they don't like is being ignored...filtered, because it just disarms them. The market clearly likes what it is hearing from the horses mouth, and seeing the reaction on the chart and in the price action....and thats all that matters!",

Hopefully we will hit 0.33p or higher so I can top slice 20% and then wait for the outcome... Either way I win, Chris a similar situation happened for JAN remember they missed our \"Xmas present mentioned\" and market dropped back down to my initial entry price of 1.45p.

As we've been told everything needed is there on site, so I'm more optimistic that the production process is already underway. The team have been on the ground for two weeks or more, and the weather has been fine. I've been checking the local weather regularly and its been largely clear with a few showers, but nothing dramatic, the heavier rain has been in the far North..about 500kms away, so no real delays due to weather. https://www.bom.gov.au/location/australia/queensland It's early morning over there as I post, approaching 7am, and clear. It's not as though they are running a dry blower where any moisture would clog up the process...it's a washplant which relies on water. NT said it was not going to be 0 - 60 in 3 days, but as the days go on they will become more efficient in making the process faster. As long as the first production RNS shows some half decent gold recovery then the market should be happy enough for further rises. If they don't show much in the first couple of weeks then maybe an over reaction very short term sell off could create a great entry back in the low 0.2p's! Exciting times...with \u00a31.5m in the bank so no chance of running out of funds.",

The share price consistently stayed above the 0.2p placing price (average about 10% above) and then just before christmas broke through 0.3p i.e a 50% move - it took ~1.1B shares to see that 50% move. This time around with such a long runway and the lack of risk over the next six months or so I think once the news tap starts flowing (late Jan, perhaps early Feb) it will be well away from the 0.26p placing price.",

When they need to purchase more equipment to run the two site the increased revenue/production will easily cover the cost in a couple of months.....I don't know how they've let anything slip as they've never said no additional equipment will be required to run two sites. Regarding funding , yes I would expect money to be spent on drilling....how else are they going to prove up Lolworth? We will also be getting revenue in from Raglan which will be topping up the coffers.. Still the BB clown (laughing at you, not with you)",

Of course if YOU bought in 2019 you are 95% down. Although if that were true I'd expect constant negative posts harping back to pre-pandemuc days....oh wait!\ud83e\udd23",

These areas will be worked at successive depths as part of a broader programme designed to determine where gold grades are highest before progressing upstream across the property. In parallel, ECR will re-analyse previously worked ground, particularly at deeper levels, where the Board believes - consistent with outcomes at the nearby Blue Mountain Project - that recoverable gold remains\nin situ\n.\nDuring the early stages of production at the Raglan Project, the operating team will assess and optimise the configuration of mining equipment, particularly the wash plant. The objective is to maximise daily throughput while maintaining a high level of gold recovery. The Company's Blue Mountain Project has been independently tested and demonstrated a recovery rate of 91.7% gold into 0.40% of the mass, and part of the coming work programme will be aimed at assessing whether Raglan will achieve a comparable recovery rate performance.\nChairman Nick Tulloch and Directors Andrew Scott and Chris Gibbs will be meeting in Queensland later this week to oversee the initial stages of mining and production activities at the Raglan Project. During the visit, the Board members will meet with the operating team, review production progress based on early grade observations and meet with a prospective off-taker for gold production from both Raglan and Blue Mountain.\nThis milestone will coincide with exceptionally strong recent precious-metal prices, with gold currently trading above\nUS$4,988 per ounce\nand silver having recently moved through\nUS$100 per ounce\n, providing a highly favourable market backdrop as ECR enters its production phase.\nOverview of the Raglan Project - Commencement of Mining and Production\nThe Raglan Project is a fully permitted, turnkey alluvial gold project located in central Queensland and held under Mining Lease ML 3665. The project includes a near-new 60 tonne-per-hour wash plant, gold room, water supply, accommodation camp and mobile mining fleet, enabling prompt mobilisation and a low-capex pathway to production.\nWith the operating team secured and all key infrastructure already on site, Raglan is expected to deliver ECR's initial gold production and near-term early cashflow. The project also provides a foundation for shared operational capability and equipment utilisation across the Company's nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.\nThe Board considers that Raglan's anticipated operating parameters are consistent with other producing alluvial mines in Queensland, where commercial production is achieved even at relatively modest grades, particularly in the current gold price environment.\nThe Company's subsidiary that owns the Raglan Project has been renamed\nECR Minerals (Raglan) Pty Limited\n, aligning it with the branding of the Company's other Australian subsidiaries.\nPortfolio Strategy\nWhile the Raglan Project represents ECR's immediate production focus, the Board's meetings will also encompass strategic planning sessions across the Company's broader Queensland and Victoria portfolio:\n\u00b7\nBlue Mountain\n- preparations to bring the Blue Mountain gold project into production are advancing, following strong alluvial drilling results, visible coarse gold and successful wash-plant trials;\n\u00b7\nLolworth\n- a significantly-sized gold-silver project where maiden drilling provided indications of a broader mineralised system, with silver emerging as a potential key value driver at current prices; and\n\u00b7\nOther Victoria tenements\n- assessing targets for prospective exploration and development activity over the year ahead.\nECR Chairman\nNick Tulloch\ncommented\n:\n\"This week will mark an important moment for ECR. With our operating team secured and a production plan in place, several members of the Board will be travelling to Queensland to oversee the implementation of our initial mining operations at Raglan. This represents a major step forward as the Company transitions from a pure explorer into an operating gold producer.\n\"Raglan is a rare, turnkey alluvial operation with plant, permits and infrastructure already in place. Its anticipated operating parameters are considered to be consistent with other producing alluvial mines in Queensland and, with gold trading at historically high levels, we believe that the project has the potential to generate meaningful cashflow in due course.\n\"Importantly, Raglan also provides a stro",

He has written many books on the world economies, how they succeed, how they fail, and how to stablise crashes. I read one of his books called The Road To Ruin, and in it he explains that in the following recession after 2008, the Govt's will have to bail out the banks...and then the subsequent crashes after that....who's going to bail out the Govt's?....the World bank, the IMF etc etc. A fascinating book. Anyway, he's a regular contributor on global financial platforms and US TV stations  because of how knowledgeable he is on the global economy, the Federal Reserve, interest rates, inflation etc. He has been calling $5000/oz Gold for a few years, because he has that kind of insight on how the financial mechanisms work. Now he's calling $10,000/oz in a shorter time frame.....and thats the point of my post. He explains the simple maths involved as the price rises. When Gold is at $2k/oz, and then rises to $3k/oz...its a 50% rise At $3k/oz if it rises to $4k/oz......its a 30% rise $4k/oz rising to $5k is a 25% rise $5k rising to $6k is a 20% rise $8k rising to $9K is a 12% rise and $9k rising to $10k is an 11% rise! So each rise higher has less resistance, because its a smaller % increase. He thinks that Gold will move rapidly through the gears, because in the current global economical conditions.....there's nothing stopping it!!!",

But most of the time he is adding to what is already known in the market. When Nick and Mike W took over in Sept '23, their distinct goal was to increase value for shareholders by selling non core assets, machinery and property, and using the funds to drill and explore the main assets, keep costs down by taking their remuneration largely in shares, and maintain a sensible approach to funding. As they continued to do what they said they would I became more and more convinced that these two were doing exactly what they said they would, and thats why I continued to build my position, buying the dips. But it wasn't only because they were doing what I thought was the best strategy, it was because of the assets...I was investing in the great locations, the size of the tenements, the massive tax loss situation, and the continued assay results showing that we 'have something good happening'. Then there was the appointment of the requisite experts to move things forward on multiple fronts, in the most professional of ways. Fast forward to Raglan and they played a blinder raising the funds to make the aquisition quick.....before anybody else could get their hands on it. We will get a full report on exactly what has been happening in Aus, and decided upon, either next week or the week after. I can't wait to read it, and then watch the inevitable interviews that always follow any new significant updates. Hopefully it will be a string of positives, followed by a favourable market reaction.",

          "content": "There's a guy called Jim Rickards, economist, lawyer etc, who has been part of the US Govt advisory team in times of recession, like the 2008 crash, when he was part of a team that encouraged 16 of the major banks and financial institutions to bail out the sub prime mortgage holders, and therefore put a halt to the domino effect of the market crash. He has written many books on the world economies, how they succeed, how they fail, and how to stablise crashes. I read one of his books called The Road To Ruin, and in it he explains that in the following recession after 2008, the Govt's will have to bail out the banks...and then the subsequent crashes after that....who's going to bail out the Govt's?....the World bank, the IMF etc etc. A fascinating book. Anyway, he's a regular contributor on global financial platforms and US TV stations  because of how knowledgeable he is on the global economy, the Federal Reserve, interest rates, inflation etc. He has been calling $5000/oz Gold for a few years, because he has that kind of insight on how the financial mechanisms work. Now he's calling $10,000/oz in a shorter time frame.....and thats the point of my post. He explains the simple maths involved as the price rises. When Gold is at $2k/oz, and then rises to $3k/oz...its a 50% rise At $3k/oz if it rises to $4k/oz......its a 30% rise $4k/oz rising to $5k is a 25% rise $5k rising to $6k is a 20% rise $8k rising to $9K is a 12% rise and $9k rising to $10k is an 11% rise! So each rise higher has less resistance, because its a smaller % increase. He thinks that Gold will move rapidly through the gears, because in the current global economical conditions.....there's nothing stopping it!!!",

          "content": "Nick Tulloch does like to keep shareholders informed, almost to a fault, and some have criticized him (guess who) claiming that he's not saying anything new. But most of the time he is adding to what is already known in the market. When Nick and Mike W took over in Sept '23, their distinct goal was to increase value for shareholders by selling non core assets, machinery and property, and using the funds to drill and explore the main assets, keep costs down by taking their remuneration largely in shares, and maintain a sensible approach to funding. As they continued to do what they said they would I became more and more convinced that these two were doing exactly what they said they would, and thats why I continued to build my position, buying the dips. But it wasn't only because they were doing what I thought was the best strategy, it was because of the assets...I was investing in the great locations, the size of the tenements, the massive tax loss situation, and the continued assay results showing that we 'have something good happening'. Then there was the appointment of the requisite experts to move things forward on multiple fronts, in the most professional of ways. Fast forward to Raglan and they played a blinder raising the funds to make the aquisition quick.....before anybody else could get their hands on it. We will get a full report on exactly what has been happening in Aus, and decided upon, either next week or the week after. I can't wait to read it, and then watch the inevitable interviews that always follow any new significant updates. Hopefully it will be a string of positives, followed by a favourable market reaction.",

Favourable weather conditions throughout Jan, so ideal opportunity for a good start. Jan is the highest rainfall month according to historical data, so we've been very lucky. Now, going forward, the months get progressively lower rainfall. ECR's coming of age to a Gold producer looks to have a set of lucky tailwinds.",

          "full_content": "3 Feb 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 4086R\nECR Minerals PLC\n03 February 2026\n03 February 2026\nECR MINERALS PLC\n(\"ECR Minerals\", \"ECR\" or the \"Company\")\nRaglan offtake partner identified and updated valuation assessment\nECR Minerals plc (AIM: ECR), the gold exploration and development company focused on Australia, is pleased to provide an update on its Raglan alluvial gold project in Queensland (the \"Raglan Project\").\nThe Company has met with and\nidentified a proposed offtake partner\n(the \"Proposed Offtake Partner\") for\ngold\nproduction from the Raglan Project (the \"Proposed Offtake Agreement\"). Members of ECR's board of directors (the \"Board\" or the \"Directors\") have\nvisited the Proposed Offtake Partner's processing and refining facility\n, undertaken discussions regarding commercial terms and operational processes and completed site-level due diligence.\nFormal documentation and contractual agreements in respect of the Proposed Offtake Agreement are\nnow being progressed and are expected to be finalised this month\n. The Board believes that this Proposed Offtake Agreement represents a clear and practical route to market for gold produced at the Raglan Project.\nECR has also separately completed an internal valuation assessment for insurance purposes of t\nhe\nplant, equipment and site infrastructure at the Raglan Project. This process covered the wash plant, gold room, mobile mining fleet, power generation, camp facilities and associated infrastructure.\nThe\nreplacement value, on a like-for-like basis, of the plant and equipment has been assessed at approximately A$1.9 million, materially exceeding the consideration paid by ECR for the Raglan Project\n. This is considered by the Board to be further validation of the\nRaglan Project\nacquisition and, importantly, demonstrates the quality of the\nRaglan Project\n's facilities.\nWith an experienced operating team in place, an identified proposed offtake pathway and a mining lease covering approximately 300 acres, the Board considers that the Raglan Project is entering mining and production with a high level of operational and commercial confidence.\nDiscussions in relation to the Proposed Offtake Agreement remain early stage and therefore there can be no certainty that final binding terms will be agreed, nor as to the timing or final terms, value or any conditions of the Proposed Offtake Agreement. Further updates will be provided in due course.\nECR Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"Identifying the Proposed Offtake Partner and visiting their facility is an important step as the Raglan Project's production plan is being implemented. Detailed discussions and proposed terms have been discussed, and we expect to finalise the formal documentation this month. This provides confidence that there is a clear and established route to market for the Raglan Project's gold.\n\"The insurance valuation of the inventory, plant and equipment has been equally encouraging. Having visited the site, I have seen first-hand the high quality of the operations and equipment. The fact that the replacement value is close to double what we paid reinforces the value embedded in the acquisition.\n\"Together, these developments further de-risk the Raglan Project at exactly the right time. Despite recent volatility, gold prices remain at historically strong levels and with all infrastructure in place and commercial arrangements moving to being finalised, we believe that the Raglan Project is well positioned to deliver early cashflow and support the continued build-out of ECR's Queensland portfolio.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nAlex Brearley / Nick Naylor / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nOAK Securities\nJoint Broker\nJerry Keen / Robert Bell\nTel: +44 (0) 3328 5656\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nJoint Broker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nJoint Broker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company operating through three wholly owned Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Australia\"), ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\") and ECR Minerals (\nRaglan) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Raglan\")\n.\nECR Australia owns the Bailieston and Creswick gold projects in central Victoria, Australia as well as the Tambo gold project in eastern Victoria.\nRaglan Resources\nhas a mining lease at the Raglan alluvial gold project in central Queensland, Australia and ECR Queensland has two approved exploration permits over the nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.

The Math: 25% of A76million=A19 million (~\u00a310 million) - This is the actual amount of cash that ECR would have paid to the Australian government but will now keep in its own bank account as it becomes profitable. if a larger mining company (like Evolution Mining or Newmont) looks at ECR, they don't just see the gold. They see a \"Tax Asset\" they can buy. If a major buys ECR for \u00a320m, they effectively \"inherit\" the ability to shield \u00a339m of their own Australian profits.

The share price here seems to be tracking every rise and fall in the gold price as if we've been a producer for a long time. What seems to be getting overlooked with ECR, is that we are only just transitioning from a junior explorer to a very promising producer, for the first time in their 25 year history, with clear evidence that we are now in the very strong position of actually creating cash flow from Raglan NOW (see pictures of first gold recovery), and in an already comfortable financial runway situation with \u00a31.5m in the bank after the recent placing. Also they have just announced a soon to be completed, this month, offtake partner deal to sell the incoming gold, at a time when the weather is set to get historically more favourable going in to Feb, March and beyond etc. The original calculations for a profitable return at Raglan was at a gold price of $2790 if I remember correctly....something of that order, and yet after confirming that a team had been selected to work on site, after posting pictures of first gold recovery, the plan for optimum geological targets being formulated for maximum return..................AND....the cherry on the cake, A$76m in historical tax losses to offset against future revenues...(so tax free production for years)...the share price, or should I say the participants in any investment in companies with Gold attached to their activities, is still stagnating under recent highs! I know that the market likes to have confirmed production figures before some of the 'frightened of their shadows' participants take a punt, but this has to be one of the stand out favourable risk/reward plays in the small cap gold production companies...anywhere, let alone one of the most lucrative regions on Earth!!! How many clues do they need, with the POG still holding above $4800/oz? Wakey wakey!!",

There's plenty of buys going through as you can see, so if it's literally impossible with Interactive Brokers I would open an ISA, sell your IB shares (if they'll let you!) and put them in your ISA.

I'll let you decide which is true. And good news today that they picked up a bargain at Raglan paying only a$1m for an asset values at a$1.9m (the advantage of buying off farmers who had no mining expertise).

It's showing signs of increase (Gold, Silver, Lithium) all up, so I hope I can keep a lid on things and not get to carried away, but I can't see any other sector getting closet mining in that time frame (apart from IMM with their soon to announced JV). Nothing is set in stone, high risk, but let's see what happens. Good look to you all.",

He has written many books on the world economies, how they succeed, how they fail, and how to stablise crashes. I read one of his books called The Road To Ruin, and in it he explains that in the following recession after 2008, the Govt's will have to bail out the banks...and then the subsequent crashes after that....who's going to bail out the Govt's?....the World bank, the IMF etc etc. A fascinating book. Anyway, he's a regular contributor on global financial platforms and US TV stations  because of how knowledgeable he is on the global economy, the Federal Reserve, interest rates, inflation etc. He has been calling $5000/oz Gold for a few years, because he has that kind of insight on how the financial mechanisms work. Now he's calling $10,000/oz in a shorter time frame.....and thats the point of my post. He explains the simple maths involved as the price rises. When Gold is at $2k/oz, and then rises to $3k/oz...its a 50% rise At $3k/oz if it rises to $4k/oz......its a 30% rise $4k/oz rising to $5k is a 25% rise $5k rising to $6k is a 20% rise $8k rising to $9K is a 12% rise and $9k rising to $10k is an 11% rise! So each rise higher has less resistance, because its a smaller % increase. He thinks that Gold will move rapidly through the gears, because in the current global economical conditions.....there's nothing stopping it!!!",

But most of the time he is adding to what is already known in the market. When Nick and Mike W took over in Sept '23, their distinct goal was to increase value for shareholders by selling non core assets, machinery and property, and using the funds to drill and explore the main assets, keep costs down by taking their remuneration largely in shares, and maintain a sensible approach to funding. As they continued to do what they said they would I became more and more convinced that these two were doing exactly what they said they would, and thats why I continued to build my position, buying the dips. But it wasn't only because they were doing what I thought was the best strategy, it was because of the assets...I was investing in the great locations, the size of the tenements, the massive tax loss situation, and the continued assay results showing that we 'have something good happening'. Then there was the appointment of the requisite experts to move things forward on multiple fronts, in the most professional of ways. Fast forward to Raglan and they played a blinder raising the funds to make the aquisition quick.....before anybody else could get their hands on it. We will get a full report on exactly what has been happening in Aus, and decided upon, either next week or the week after. I can't wait to read it, and then watch the inevitable interviews that always follow any new significant updates. Hopefully it will be a string of positives, followed by a favourable market reaction.",

Now, going forward, the months get progressively lower rainfall. ECR's coming of age to a Gold producer looks to have a set of lucky tailwinds.",

To keep bellyaching about the history of ECR, when there was a completely different board of directors, with a completely different strategy to move forward, when the Gold price was one third of what it is now, around $1750/oz.......is very strange. I think that Old Bailey is..........well......either desperate for attention, or a desperate historical loser of funds after timing an entry wrong. And now, is a bitter and twisted loser, and wants to try to spread the pain of his own mistakes because he was not experienced enough to calculate his timing of entry....and just fell in to the AIM market trap of being gullible enough to believe...and bought in too high...without a stop loss to protect his funds. Instead of bellyaching and focusing on his losses he should have been evaluating the future, not the past! If he was smart enough he should have recognised, at 0.20p, or at the placing price of 0.26p, that those were the times to buy! But no, he just wants to bellyache about those times when he decided to buy in back in the day. He clearly has no concept of 'timing' the market!

I think that ECR have gold to sell. That much was evident in the pictures the other day.Not much gold, but still gold. If i recall, NT said production would start at the end of Jan, and be scaled up by the end of March. So any accurate production figures may take another 6 weeks before they come through. I would also like to remind you of the placing at 0.26p. The share price is 30% higher now. Not shabby at all As for being psychic, well they are your words. I can only deduce that you have done your nuts, and seek solace in the bottle. Why else would somebody not invested, get so angry every time they post here? For the record i have 3,242,946 shares. \u00a310,850 quid invested, in three tranches. At an average of 33.5p. And i will invest some more. Get some help for your problem mate.

'Chris was the former CEO of ASX-listed American Rare Earths, when it advanced its 2.63 billion tonne Halleck Creek rare earth project and substantially grew its market capitalisation. At American Rare Earths, he was instrumental in its transformation into a development-ready US rare earths company, which substantially increased its market value. At Argonaut Gold, he oversaw the Magino Gold Project from feasibility through to construction and operations readiness. Earlier roles with Centerra Gold, Barrick Gold and Placer Dome involved large-scale mine development, operational turnarounds and cost transformation initiatives across multiple jurisdictions. Chris currently serves as a Non-Executive Director of ASX-listed Godolphin Resources Limited and is a Director of the Critical Minerals Institute. He resides in Queensland, Australia, the state in which ECR's core Blue Mountain and Lolworth Projects are located. And in Mike Parker last August....because they knew what was to come!!! ECR Minerals plc (LON: ECR), the exploration and development company focused on gold in Australia, is pleased to announce that Mike Parker has been appointed as a director to the board of ECR Minerals (the \"Board\") with immediate effect as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. Mike has been a consultant geologist to ECR since 2024. Mike has extensive experience in exploration and project development, overseeing projects from discovery through construction to production. He had a 22-year tenure at First Quantum Minerals (FQM) where he held progressively senior country manager positions, and was instrumental in two major copper discoveries: the Lonshi and Frontier mines. He was country manager in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for FQM, overseeing up to 3,000 staff with two operating copper mines and a mine construction project. Between 2011 to 2017, he was country manager for FQM in Peru, responsible for the design and implementation of FQM's corporate strategy in Latin America, including Argentina and Chile. He oversaw community relations programs and sustainability processes, ensuring that projects complemented community development in remote areas including preparations for resettlement programs. He was responsible for government relations and communications throughout Latin America. Australia, on a Govt level, has very little objection to mining and mining licences, because they want the income. ECR are going places...maybe big places. :-)",

Mon Dieu! Probably as happy as I could be. Management holding many shares. Options at 0.5p and 0.75p...  and a penny representing \u00a333 million MCap which seems entirely reachable with elevated gold price and further exploration potentials. JV at Creswick...fine. BUT, when cash allows (soon?) I expect a further deep drilling campaign at Balieston because Antimony is certainly one of the elements of extreme choice. If they had good hits below the .3m 30% Sb strike at the end (146m from memory) of one of the previous holes...or gold hits too (Southern Cross) it would get awfully messy here in a good way. So yeah.... quite a nice position. I am trying not to watch it all time now. Come back in 6 months... Just as an aside... I am a guy who sold EEE at 0.8p after quite a long hold.

The Math: 25% of A76million=A19 million (~\u00a310 million) - This is the actual amount of cash that ECR would have paid to the Australian government but will now keep in its own bank account as it becomes profitable. if a larger mining company (like Evolution Mining or Newmont) looks at ECR, they don't just see the gold. They see a \"Tax Asset\" they can buy. If a major buys ECR for \u00a320m, they effectively \"inherit\" the ability to shield \u00a339m of their own Australian profits. This makes ECR a cheaper acquisition for a big player than a similar company without the losses. This creates a \"Soft Floor\" under the share price.

The share price here seems to be tracking every rise and fall in the gold price as if we've been a producer for a long time. What seems to be getting overlooked with ECR, is that we are only just transitioning from a junior explorer to a very promising producer, for the first time in their 25 year history, with clear evidence that we are now in the very strong position of actually creating cash flow from Raglan NOW (see pictures of first gold recovery), and in an already comfortable financial runway situation with \u00a31.5m in the bank after the recent placing. Also they have just announced a soon to be completed, this month, offtake partner deal to sell the incoming gold, at a time when the weather is set to get historically more favourable going in to Feb, March and beyond etc. The original calculations for a profitable return at Raglan was at a gold price of $2790 if I remember correctly....something of that order, and yet after confirming that a team had been selected to work on site, after posting pictures of first gold recovery, the plan for optimum geological targets being formulated for maximum return..................AND....the cherry on the cake, A$76m in historical tax losses to offset against future revenues...(so tax free production for years)...the share price, or should I say the participants in any investment in companies with Gold attached to their activities, is still stagnating under recent highs! I know that the market likes to have confirmed production figures before some of the 'frightened of their shadows' participants take a punt, but this has to be one of the stand out favourable risk/reward plays in the small cap gold production companies...anywhere, let alone one of the most lucrative regions on Earth!!! How many clues do they need, with the POG still holding above $4800/oz? Wakey wakey!!",

There's plenty of buys going through as you can see, so if it's literally impossible with Interactive Brokers I would open an ISA, sell your IB shares (if they'll let you!) and put them in your ISA. If you time it right you might even increase your holding or pocket a few quid in the process.",

I'll let you decide which is true. And good news today that they picked up a bargain at Raglan paying only a$1m for an asset values at a$1.9m (the advantage of buying off farmers who had no mining expertise). And to think some posters were claiming that the value of Raglan was much less than ECR paid for it (they look foolish now).",

          "content": "There's a guy called Jim Rickards, economist, lawyer etc, who has been part of the US Govt advisory team in times of recession, like the 2008 crash, when he was part of a team that encouraged 16 of the major banks and financial institutions to bail out the sub prime mortgage holders, and therefore put a halt to the domino effect of the market crash. He has written many books on the world economies, how they succeed, how they fail, and how to stablise crashes. I read one of his books called The Road To Ruin, and in it he explains that in the following recession after 2008, the Govt's will have to bail out the banks...and then the subsequent crashes after that....who's going to bail out the Govt's?....the World bank, the IMF etc etc. A fascinating book. Anyway, he's a regular contributor on global financial platforms and US TV stations  because of how knowledgeable he is on the global economy, the Federal Reserve, interest rates, inflation etc. He has been calling $5000/oz Gold for a few years, because he has that kind of insight on how the financial mechanisms work. Now he's calling $10,000/oz in a shorter time frame.....and thats the point of my post. He explains the simple maths involved as the price rises. When Gold is at $2k/oz, and then rises to $3k/oz...its a 50% rise At $3k/oz if it rises to $4k/oz......its a 30% rise $4k/oz rising to $5k is a 25% rise $5k rising to $6k is a 20% rise $8k rising to $9K is a 12% rise and $9k rising to $10k is an 11% rise! So each rise higher has less resistance, because its a smaller % increase. He thinks that Gold will move rapidly through the gears, because in the current global economical conditions.....there's nothing stopping it!!!",

Ive read about raglan and how they are going to wash the gold out with alluvial techniques which is the cheapest way to do it...when are they going to say how much they've panned out and is my punt going to pay off as I've got about 500,000 shares . Ive been looking for another bagger after paf and I hope this is one of em. I know many people are more invested than me but I like these mining boards good comments and tips from guys with experience.  Cheers and glad everyone",

          "content": "Nick Tulloch does like to keep shareholders informed, almost to a fault, and some have criticized him (guess who) claiming that he's not saying anything new. But most of the time he is adding to what is already known in the market. When Nick and Mike W took over in Sept '23, their distinct goal was to increase value for shareholders by selling non core assets, machinery and property, and using the funds to drill and explore the main assets, keep costs down by taking their remuneration largely in shares, and maintain a sensible approach to funding. As they continued to do what they said they would I became more and more convinced that these two were doing exactly what they said they would, and thats why I continued to build my position, buying the dips. But it wasn't only because they were doing what I thought was the best strategy, it was because of the assets...I was investing in the great locations, the size of the tenements, the massive tax loss situation, and the continued assay results showing that we 'have something good happening'. Then there was the appointment of the requisite experts to move things forward on multiple fronts, in the most professional of ways. Fast forward to Raglan and they played a blinder raising the funds to make the aquisition quick.....before anybody else could get their hands on it. We will get a full report on exactly what has been happening in Aus, and decided upon, either next week or the week after. I can't wait to read it, and then watch the inevitable interviews that always follow any new significant updates. Hopefully it will be a string of positives, followed by a favourable market reaction.",

For me it\u2019s now highly unlikely with gold over $5000/oz and \u00a31.5m in the bank that there will be any further discounted AIM placings and that makes it worth holding firm no matter what share price appreciation we see throughout this year, whether that\u2019s 0.5p, 1p or even higher.",

The plan follows the main historic riverbed through the Raglan Project area.\n\u00b7\nDark blue\nrepresents the area targeted for mining\n\u00b7\nGreen\nshows areas previously trenched by historical operators\nFigure 1\nThe proposed mineable area defined at this stage comprises approximately\n162,000 m\u00b2\n.\nAssuming gold-bearing gravels extend to an average depth of\n1.5 metres\n, the initial plan would cover approximately\n243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material,\nwhich ECR would intend to mine and process over a multi-year period\n.\nUsing what the Board considers to be a conservative average grade of\n0.12 grammes per bank cubic metre\n, derived from all test work completed to date (including lower-grade material), the Phase 1 mining area is illustratively estimated to contain approximately\n938 ounces of gold\n.\nAt current gold prices, this would equate to an indicative gross\nin-situ\nvalue of approximately\nA$7 million\n.\nKey Assumptions and Scope\nInvestors should note that the analysis is internal and illustrative only and is only disclosed for the purpose of providing geological context and to assist in understanding the rationale for the Company's\nPhase 1 mining plan and has not been\nverified or validated by any third parties.\nThe Directors consider that the analysis is intentionally conservative and based on the following assumptions:\n\u00b7\nThe average grade used reflects all test results to date, including lower-grade material and the analysis assumes that this is representative across the Phase 1 mining area\n\u00b7\nGold-bearing gravel depth is expected to vary across the project area and the analysis assumes that an average depth of\n1.5 metres\nis representative across the Phase 1 mining area, to provide approximately\n243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material for processing\n\u00b7\nThe analysis assumes that a minimum gross gold price of A$7,150 per ounce will be achievable over the\nmulti-year period required to mine and process 243,000 bank cubic metres\nof material\n\u00b7\nPreviously mined areas are assumed to contain no recoverable gold\n\u00b7\nNo allowance has been made for side creeks, extensions along strike, deeper gravels or optimisation of mining methods. Proposed mineable side creeks are highlighted in yellow in Figure 1.\nThe analysis is based on internal operational planning work and does not constitute a mineral resource or reserve estimate, or a resource update in accordance with the AIM Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies (the \"AIM MOG Note\"). In addition, nor was any analysis prepared to the standards set forth in the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (\"JORC\") or prepared in accordance with any other appropriate internationally recognised reporting standard (\"Standard\") for mineral resources and reserves as set out in the AIM MOG Note.\nClear Path to Expansion\nImportantly, the work completed to date represents only the\ninitial phase of mining planned at the Raglan Project\n. The defined area has been selected to provide a conservative, clearly delineated starting point for operations.\nOver the coming weeks, the Company intends to dig and process a series of test pits at the northern end of the Raglan Project area outside",

The RNS was probably not exciting enough for some, but the key thing here is revenue. If it's multi year I would guess they would probably be looking for A$1M per year at least, with a reasonable profit margin. Revenue generation is the holy grail for junior explorers transitioning to producers because it obviously reduces the amount they need to tap shareholders for cash, and perhaps gives them leeway to speed up exploration elsewhere. Not a mind blowing RNS, but another positive move forward. Sometimes it's hard to understand the market reaction to news.",

The November 2024 placing of \u00a3750k + ~\u00a3150k (some land tenure and possibly a bit over from Raglan raise) gave 16 months of runway to Mar 31st 2026, this \u00a31.5m cash is a good two years before we even add in Raglan contributions.

I SAID THIS MONTHS AGO THEY WILL PRODUCE INITIALLY FROM RAGLAN WHILE WAITING ON BM AND THEN SUNSET RAGLAN AS ITS NOT A SERIOUS OPERATION- EVERYONE LAUGHS BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS NO need to have raglan equipment at Raglan and having to buy more for BM, as the LOM at Raglan doesnt make it make sense to have two lots of everything! Raglan was a market spin for a placing! its not a long term project and that is coming out in the wash No comment on when production would actually start is also concerning nor any update on BM!

I think that Old Bailey is..........well......either desperate for attention, or a desperate historical loser of funds after timing an entry wrong. And now, is a bitter and twisted loser, and wants to try to spread the pain of his own mistakes because he was not experienced enough to calculate his timing of entry....and just fell in to the AIM market trap of being gullible enough to believe...and bought in too high...without a stop loss to protect his funds. Instead of bellyaching and focusing on his losses he should have been evaluating the future, not the past! If he was smart enough he should have recognised, at 0.20p, or at the placing price of 0.26p, that those were the times to buy! But no, he just wants to bellyache about those times when he decided to buy in back in the day. He clearly has no concept of 'timing' the market!

I think that ECR have gold to sell. That much was evident in the pictures the other day.Not much gold, but still gold. If i recall, NT said production would start at the end of Jan, and be scaled up by the end of March. So any accurate production figures may take another 6 weeks before they come through. I would also like to remind you of the placing at 0.26p. The share price is 30% higher now. Not shabby at all As for being psychic, well they are your words. I can only deduce that you have done your nuts, and seek solace in the bottle. Why else would somebody not invested, get so angry every time they post here? For the record i have 3,242,946 shares. \u00a310,850 quid invested, in three tranches. At an average of 33.5p. And i will invest some more. Get some help for your problem mate. Nobody likes to witness a fellow poster have a breakdown. Whether they are invested or not.",

'Chris was the former CEO of ASX-listed American Rare Earths, when it advanced its 2.63 billion tonne Halleck Creek rare earth project and substantially grew its market capitalisation. At American Rare Earths, he was instrumental in its transformation into a development-ready US rare earths company, which substantially increased its market value. At Argonaut Gold, he oversaw the Magino Gold Project from feasibility through to construction and operations readiness. Earlier roles with Centerra Gold, Barrick Gold and Placer Dome involved large-scale mine development, operational turnarounds and cost transformation initiatives across multiple jurisdictions. Chris currently serves as a Non-Executive Director of ASX-listed Godolphin Resources Limited and is a Director of the Critical Minerals Institute. He resides in Queensland, Australia, the state in which ECR's core Blue Mountain and Lolworth Projects are located. And in Mike Parker last August....because they knew what was to come!!! ECR Minerals plc (LON: ECR), the exploration and development company focused on gold in Australia, is pleased to announce that Mike Parker has been appointed as a director to the board of ECR Minerals (the \"Board\") with immediate effect as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. Mike has been a consultant geologist to ECR since 2024. Mike has extensive experience in exploration and project development, overseeing projects from discovery through construction to production. He had a 22-year tenure at First Quantum Minerals (FQM) where he held progressively senior country manager positions, and was instrumental in two major copper discoveries: the Lonshi and Frontier mines. He was country manager in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for FQM, overseeing up to 3,000 staff with two operating copper mines and a mine construction project. Between 2011 to 2017, he was country manager for FQM in Peru, responsible for the design and implementation of FQM's corporate strategy in Latin America, including Argentina and Chile. He oversaw community relations programs and sustainability processes, ensuring that projects complemented community development in remote areas including preparations for resettlement programs. He was responsible for government relations and communications throughout Latin America. Australia, on a Govt level, has very little objection to mining and mining licences, because they want the income. ECR are going places...maybe big places. :-)",

I have been unable to stop myself having another million. The 'runway' here as you say is compelling. However long it takes to get the first production numbers, it won't be that long. Or the first sale of gold to the offtake partner... Then you have the cashed up level post recent raise, tax free revenue underway at Raglan, application for the second and bigger revenue producing asset at Blue Mountain and the massive compelling multi-element licence at Lolworth.... Mon Dieu! Probably as happy as I could be. Management holding many shares. Options at 0.5p and 0.75p...  and a penny representing \u00a333 million MCap which seems entirely reachable with elevated gold price and further exploration potentials. JV at Creswick...fine. BUT, when cash allows (soon?) I expect a further deep drilling campaign at Balieston because Antimony is certainly one of the elements of extreme choice. If they had good hits below the .3m 30% Sb strike at the end (146m from memory) of one of the previous holes...or gold hits too (Southern Cross) it would get awfully messy here in a good way. So yeah.... quite a nice position. I am trying not to watch it all time now. Come back in 6 months... Just as an aside... I am a guy who sold EEE at 0.8p after quite a long hold. And then their fortunes changed.... just a bit. Not saying you will get that here but you never know. Experience tells me this. Which leads to the P word. Patience.",

The Math: 25% of A76million=A19 million (~\u00a310 million) - This is the actual amount of cash that ECR would have paid to the Australian government but will now keep in its own bank account as it becomes profitable. if a larger mining company (like Evolution Mining or Newmont) looks at ECR, they don't just see the gold. They see a \"Tax Asset\" they can buy. If a major buys ECR for \u00a320m, they effectively \"inherit\" the ability to shield \u00a339m of their own Australian profits. This makes ECR a cheaper acquisition for a big player than a similar company without the losses. This creates a \"Soft Floor\" under the share price.

          "content": "How many more clues does the market need to rate ECR much higher than it is at the current share price? It seems that every trader/investor has been spooked by the recent 'crash' in the gold price...from the spectacular run up to $5100, to then get manipulated down to as low as $4400...and now regaining some of that fall, currently at $4850! The share price here seems to be tracking every rise and fall in the gold price as if we've been a producer for a long time. What seems to be getting overlooked with ECR, is that we are only just transitioning from a junior explorer to a very promising producer, for the first time in their 25 year history, with clear evidence that we are now in the very strong position of actually creating cash flow from Raglan NOW (see pictures of first gold recovery), and in an already comfortable financial runway situation with \u00a31.5m in the bank after the recent placing. Also they have just announced a soon to be completed, this month, offtake partner deal to sell the incoming gold, at a time when the weather is set to get historically more favourable going in to Feb, March and beyond etc. The original calculations for a profitable return at Raglan was at a gold price of $2790 if I remember correctly....something of that order, and yet after confirming that a team had been selected to work on site, after posting pictures of first gold recovery, the plan for optimum geological targets being formulated for maximum return..................AND....the cherry on the cake, A$76m in historical tax losses to offset against future revenues...(so tax free production for years)...the share price, or should I say the participants in any investment in companies with Gold attached to their activities, is still stagnating under recent highs! I know that the market likes to have confirmed production figures before some of the 'frightened of their shadows' participants take a punt, but this has to be one of the stand out favourable risk/reward plays in the small cap gold production companies...anywhere, let alone one of the most lucrative regions on Earth!!! How many clues do they need, with the POG still holding above $4800/oz? Wakey wakey!!",

There's plenty of buys going through as you can see, so if it's literally impossible with Interactive Brokers I would open an ISA, sell your IB shares (if they'll let you!) and put them in your ISA.

I'll let you decide which is true. And good news today that they picked up a bargain at Raglan paying only a$1m for an asset values at a$1.9m (the advantage of buying off farmers who had no mining expertise).

          "content": "There's a guy called Jim Rickards, economist, lawyer etc, who has been part of the US Govt advisory team in times of recession, like the 2008 crash, when he was part of a team that encouraged 16 of the major banks and financial institutions to bail out the sub prime mortgage holders, and therefore put a halt to the domino effect of the market crash. He has written many books on the world economies, how they succeed, how they fail, and how to stablise crashes. I read one of his books called The Road To Ruin, and in it he explains that in the following recession after 2008, the Govt's will have to bail out the banks...and then the subsequent crashes after that....who's going to bail out the Govt's?....the World bank, the IMF etc etc. A fascinating book. Anyway, he's a regular contributor on global financial platforms and US TV stations  because of how knowledgeable he is on the global economy, the Federal Reserve, interest rates, inflation etc. He has been calling $5000/oz Gold for a few years, because he has that kind of insight on how the financial mechanisms work. Now he's calling $10,000/oz in a shorter time frame.....and thats the point of my post. He explains the simple maths involved as the price rises. When Gold is at $2k/oz, and then rises to $3k/oz...its a 50% rise At $3k/oz if it rises to $4k/oz......its a 30% rise $4k/oz rising to $5k is a 25% rise $5k rising to $6k is a 20% rise $8k rising to $9K is a 12% rise and $9k rising to $10k is an 11% rise! So each rise higher has less resistance, because its a smaller % increase. He thinks that Gold will move rapidly through the gears, because in the current global economical conditions.....there's nothing stopping it!!!",

Ive been looking for another bagger after paf and I hope this is one of em.

But most of the time he is adding to what is already known in the market. When Nick and Mike W took over in Sept '23, their distinct goal was to increase value for shareholders by selling non core assets, machinery and property, and using the funds to drill and explore the main assets, keep costs down by taking their remuneration largely in shares, and maintain a sensible approach to funding. As they continued to do what they said they would I became more and more convinced that these two were doing exactly what they said they would, and thats why I continued to build my position, buying the dips. But it wasn't only because they were doing what I thought was the best strategy, it was because of the assets...I was investing in the great locations, the size of the tenements, the massive tax loss situation, and the continued assay results showing that we 'have something good happening'. Then there was the appointment of the requisite experts to move things forward on multiple fronts, in the most professional of ways. Fast forward to Raglan and they played a blinder raising the funds to make the aquisition quick.....before anybody else could get their hands on it. We will get a full report on exactly what has been happening in Aus, and decided upon, either next week or the week after. I can't wait to read it, and then watch the inevitable interviews that always follow any new significant updates. Hopefully it will be a string of positives, followed by a favourable market reaction.",

Now, going forward, the months get progressively lower rainfall. ECR's coming of age to a Gold producer looks to have a set of lucky tailwinds.",
