With initial gold production at Raglan expected this month and development underway at Blue Mountain, the Board considers that ECR is now positioned to transition into a multi-project gold producer and explorer.\nThe Directors intend that the majority of the net proceeds of the Fundraising will be used to advance ECR's projects in Queensland and Victoria, specifically:\n\u00b7\nFinalising preparations to bring the Blue Mountain gold project in Queensland, Australia (the \"Blue Mountain Project\") into production to generate revenue for the Company, including securing all necessary equipment for production (noting that ECR expects some sharing of resources, and therefore economies of operation, between its Blue Mountain Project and the Raglan alluvial gold project in Queensland (the \"Raglan Project\")\n\u00b7\nTargeted exploration at the Lolworth Project, North Queensland, Australia (the \"Lolworth Project\")\nwhere last year's maiden drilling campaign produced notable shallow intercepts of gold and silver. At a 900 km2 project area, the Lolworth Project is considered by the Board to represent a potentially significant multi-metal opportunity for ECR\n\u00b7\nDeveloping the Company's partnership with the Geological Survey of Queensland and James Cook University to further investigate the critical minerals potential at the Lolworth Project\n\u00b7\nAdvancing ECR's projects in Victoria, primarily at the Bailieston Project area (the \"Bailieston Project\"), where previous drilling has indicated the presence of gold at shallow depth and potentially high grade antimony\nThe Directors also intend to apply the net proceeds of the Fundraising towards ECR's corporate and working capital purposes. Following completion of the Fundraising, and taking account of its forthcoming production plans at the Raglan and Blue Mountain Projects, the Board believes that ECR should be funded for all currently planned activities until very significantly beyond the end of 2026.\nIn the medium to longer term, the Directors believe that the cashflow potential from gold production from the Raglan Project, once that project is fully operational, has the potential to cover all of the Company's overheads and bringing Blue Mountain into production has the potential to support ECR's currently contemplated future exploration and development operations.\nDetails of the Fundraising\nThe Company has conditionally raised \u00a31.5 million (before expenses) through the Fundraising for a total of\n576,923,068\nnew Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price. The new Ordinary Shares will be issued on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to the authorities granted to the Board at the Company's annual general meeting held on 23 April 2025.\nThe new Ordinary Shares, when issued and fully paid, will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares in issue and therefore will rank equally for all dividends or other distributions declared, made or paid after the issue of the new Ordinary Shares.\nThe Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 22 per cent. to the closing middle market price of 0.335 pence per Ordinary Share on 7 January 2026, being the latest business day prior to the announcement of the Fundraising.\nOAK Securities (\"OAK Securities\") acted as the Company's broker in connection with the Fundraising.\nJoint Broker Appointment and Broker Warrants\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that OAK Securities has been appointed as a Joint Broker to the Company with immediate effect. OAK Securities has agreed that its fees for the first year of its appointment as Joint Broker will be payable by the Company in\n23,076,923\nnew Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price, which are to be issued upon Admission (as defined below).\nIn connection with the Fundraising, the Company will issue, on completion of the Fundraise,\n42,307,692\nwarrants to OAK Securities (the \"Broker Warrants\"). Each Broker Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one new Ordinary Share exercisable at the Issue Price. OAK Securities has agreed that the Broker Warrants will not be exercised for at least six months. Thereafter the Broker Warrants are exercisable at any time until the third year anniversary of Admission. The Broker Warrants will not be tradeable, transferable nor CREST-enabled.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nAn application will be made to London Stock Exchange plc (\"London Stock Exchange\") for the 599,999,991 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\") and it is currently anticipated that Admission will become effective, and that dealings in the new Ordinary Shares will commence on AIM, at 8.00 a.m. on or around 15 January 2026. Completion of the Fundraising is conditional on Admission.\nUpon Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital will consist of 3,290,888,016 Ordinary Shares with one voting right each. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, from Admission the total number of Ordinary Shares and voting rights in the Company will be 3,290,888,016. With effect from Admission, this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nNick Tulloch, ECR's Chairman,\ncommented\n:\n\"Today's \u00a31.5 million Fundraising is a major step forward for ECR and we are delighted by the backing received from institutional investors. This support reflects confidence in both our strategy and our progress as we establish ECR as a multi-site gold company.\n\"Our immediate focus is on near-term production. At the Raglan Project, with an operating team now secured, the Board expects initial gold this month. The Blue Mountain Project, which represents a significantly larger opportunity, continues to validate its commercial potential following last year's drilling and wash-plant work, and we are advancing our preparations for development.\n\"At the same time, we remain committed to unlocking the considerable exploration upside across our broader portfolio - including at the Lolworth Project, which we consider has significant multi-metal potential, and our Victorian projects where our work to date indicates shallow gold and high-grade antimony mineralisation offering further opportunities.\n\"With this Fundraising, our strong project pipeline and A$76 million of tax losses available to offset future production profits, we consider that ECR is now well-capitalised and positioned to develop into a significant mining and exploration company in 2026 and beyond.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 3328 5656\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nAlex Brearley / Nick Naylor / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nOAK Securities\nTel: +44 (0) 203 973 3678\nJoint Broker\nJerry Keen / Robert Bell\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 203 026 0320\nJoint Broker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nJoint Broker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company operating through three wholly owned Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Australia\"), ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\") and\nRaglan Resources Pty Ltd (\"Raglan Resources\")\n.\nECR Australia owns the Bailieston and Creswick gold projects in central Victoria, Australia as well as the Tambo gold project in eastern Victoria.\nRaglan Resources\nhas a mining lease at the Raglan alluvial gold project in central Queensland, Australia and ECR Queensland has two approved exploration permits over the nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.

Recently acquired by ECR Minerals, the Raglan Project includes a near-new 60 tonne-per-hour wash plant, a fully equipped gold room, established water supply, accommodation camp, mobile mining fleet and complete site infrastructure, providing a true turnkey mining solution. Positioned within an established gold-producing district, the Raglan Project potentially offers a low-capex, rapid pathway to production. The Raglan Project is also strategically located close to ECR's Blue Mountain alluvial project, enabling potential operational synergies across the Company's growing Queensland hub.\nECR Chairman, Nick Tulloch, commented:\n\"Securing our operating team is the final major step to bring the Raglan Project into production, and I am thrilled that we can now set a clear expectation of initial gold production before the end of January 2026. This is a pivotal moment in ECR's journey. The Raglan Project gives us a low-capex, near-term route into gold production, and the revenues which we ultimately anticipate should be able to support the development of our broader Queensland portfolio - most notably the much larger Blue Mountain project.\n\"Momentum across the Company has been pleasing in recent months, from strong maiden drill results at the Lolworth project confirming a gold-silver system, to completing the acquisition of the Raglan Project. With\ncurrent gold prices sitting at historically high levels, the Raglan Project has the potential to be a profitable project\n, generating meaningful cashflow in due course that can be reinvested across the business.\n\"We entered 2026 with confidence and a clear operational plan. I look forward to updating shareholders as we move into production and begin generating cashflow for the first time in ECR's history.\"\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nECR Minerals Plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 8080 8176\nNick Tulloch, Chairman\nAndrew Scott, Director\ninfo@ecrminerals.com\nWebsite:\nwww.ecrminerals.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n3328 5656\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nAlex Brearley / Nick Naylor / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner (Sales and Corporate Broking)\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nTel: +44 (0)\n203 026 0320\nJoint Broker\nLewis Jones\nSI Capital Ltd\nTel: +44 (0) 1483 413500\nJoint Broker\nNick Emerson\nBrand Communications\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nPublic & Investor Relations\nAlan Green\nABOUT ECR MINERALS PLC\nECR Minerals is a mineral exploration and development company operating through three wholly owned Australian subsidiaries ECR Minerals (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Australia\"), ECR Minerals (Queensland) Pty Ltd (\"ECR Queensland\") and\nRaglan Resources Pty Ltd (\"Raglan Resources\")\n.\nECR Australia owns the Bailieston and Creswick gold projects in central Victoria, Australia as well as the Tambo gold project in eastern Victoria.\nRaglan Resources\nhas a mining lease at the Raglan alluvial gold project in central Queensland, Australia and ECR Queensland has two approved exploration permits over the nearby Blue Mountain alluvial gold project.

The most important of those is Blue Mountain which, based on acreage, is a potentially far larger project. The proximity of the two projects will enable us to share plant and equipment and\noperational expertise across both sites, aiming to enhance the efficiency of both\n. We also intend to utilise our A$76 million of tax losses to offset against future production profits.\n\"With the price of gold - and particularly silver - recently pushing to new highs,\ntiming could not be better.
