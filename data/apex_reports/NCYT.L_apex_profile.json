Since its launch in July 2025, the Company has successfully placed 10 instruments, with multiple collaborations secured and demonstrations to customers delivered. The Group confirms a healthy pipeline of opportunities for 2026 and beyond, as customers proactively reach out to learn more about this technology.\nDespite the\ndecline in sales within the Company's RUO segment, the Group successfully launched Primerdesign exsig\u00ae Mag RapidBead Pro Extraction Kit in November 2025. The cost-efficient, end-to-end solution, delivers superior performance for the Group's partners, setting a new standard for DNA/RNA purification. Combining the proven reliability of the exsig\u00ae Mag kit and the speed of a next-generation rapid extraction workflow, the kit helps researchers accelerate molecular discovery and pathogen testing from sample to results.\nFinally, Beta testing is underway with international key opinion leaders in the field of precision medicine for Yourgene's\nInsight\nDPYD assay, the enhanced DPYD test which helps identify cancer patients at risk of suffering a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to common chemotherapy. This Beta testing has commenced in good time, ahead of the product launch expected in H1 2026.\nFinal results\nThe Group expects to report its full year results for the year ended 31 December 2025 during April 2026.\nCommenting on the trading update Lyn Rees, CEO of Novacyt, said:\n\"With the period of restructuring and integration completed, and the successful derisked and stabilised business formed, we committed as a Board to deliver top line growth. We're therefore pleased to have delivered year on year revenue growth in line with market expectations. It's also pleasing to report two consecutive periods of half-year growth underpinned by an upward trajectory of revenue growth.

(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), the international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, announces it will issue an investor presentation today via the Investor Meet Company platform, detailing the Company's growth plan, providing FY25 outlook and will set out its strategic goals, as detailed below.\nFY25 outlook\nNovacyt expects to see a slight increase in H2 2025 revenues vs H1 2025, driven primarily by increased instrument sales, with new orders received from the recently launched LightBench\u00ae Discover instrument. The Group expects to report an improvement in EBITDA loss for 2025 compared to the loss reported in FY24 of \u00a39.1m which will be supported by an improved gross margin contribution. Cash outflow is also expected to improve in H2 2025 and will be lower than the H1 2025 cash outflow of \u00a36.8m, largely as a result of completing the site consolidation and restructuring work.\nOrganic financial goals\nNovacyt has set out and committed to the following three organic KPIs, clearly defined below:\n1) To deliver double digit revenue growth year-on-year (from FY26)\n2) To deliver a gross margin across the Group of over 60% each year (H1 FY25 66%)\n3) To achieve EBITDA profitability based on the organic growth plans supported by the Company's balance sheet strength as soon as possible\nGrowth strategy\nFollowing a period of restructuring, reducing the cost base and rightsizing the Group's operational footprint, the business is now derisked with a strong core business and foundations for growth. Novacyt has an established customer base in key markets and a robust commercialisation strategy to drive the business forward with the ability to rapidly pivot and leverage the Group's core capabilities to meet emerging market needs.\nIn 2024, the Company agreed to invest up to \u00a32m per year from 2025-2027 to accelerate bringing new products to market. Novacyt continues to execute this strategy with product launches such as LightBench\u00ae Discover in July 2025, to support PacBio's labs using long read sequencers and the APAC focused NIPT solution which was launched in Q4 2025 to meet the changing needs of the APAC market. Through a mixed model strategy of licensing external technologies and building the Group's own products in-house, alongside strong partnerships and collaborations with blue chip partners, Novacyt has created a solid foundation from which it can deliver top line growth to support it reaching EBITDA profitability.\nInvestor presentation\nThe investor presentation will be issued on Wednesday 22 October at 7.00am BST and include presentations from Lyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer, and Steve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer, who will talk through the interim results for the six months ended 30 June, the organic financial targets set out by the Company above and how the Group is well positioned for growth. The presentation will also feature contributions from both Dr. Jo Mason, Chief Scientific Officer, and Maria Watters, Chief Commercial Officer, who will discuss the New Product Introduction strategy of the Group and Commercialisation.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and register\nhere\n.\nThe presentation will be made available on the Company's website here -\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors/presentations/\nShareholders and interested parties can sign up to receive the latest Company's announcements and updates by emailing:\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n.\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nSinger Capital Markets\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7496 3000\nTom Salvesen / Phil Davies / James Fischer / Samed Ethemi\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nPaul McManus / Lianne Applegarth\nAlice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7584 391 303\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.

(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), an international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services,\nannounces the launch of\nLightBench\u00ae Discover, a high-precision 3-in-1 instrument for genomic research labs conducting long-read sequencing.\nThe concept for the LightBench\u00ae Discover was developed following a close collaboration with PacBio\u00ae, where Yourgene Health became a PacBio\u00ae Compatible Partner for the original LightBench\u00ae in November 2023. As part of product development for LightBench\u00ae Discover, Novacyt deployed prototype instruments into the field to gather customer feedback on user experience, develop protocols and run real world samples to assess the instruments' performance.\nLightBench\n\u00ae\nDiscover is an integrated single benchtop solution that replaces the need for multiple instruments in labs\nconducting long-read HiFi sequencing, who need both large fragment analytics (larger than 20 kilobases) and DNA size selection. In addition, LightBench\u00ae Discover also delivers fluorometric quantification.\nResearchers benefit from a cost-effective, high-performance system that enhances efficiency, whilst eliminating the need to invest in multiple instruments with separate service contracts and software platforms.\nThe product has extended capabilities (compared to the original LightBench\n\u00ae\n) for large fragment analytics up to 150 kilobases, along with size selection and quantification functions, making it ideal for research applications utilising long read sequencing on the PacBio Revio\n\u00ae\nor Vega\u2122 systems.\nToday, the Company has released the Technical Note showcasing data from its collaborator The CoLab at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Alabama, US. The Technical Note will be hosted on the Company's website\nhttps://yourgenehealth.com/our-products/instruments/lightbench-discover/\nand on the PacBio\u00ae Compatible Partners webpage\nhttps://www.pacb.com/3rd-party-compatible-products/\n.\nLyn Rees, CEO of Novacyt, commented\n:\n\"The product development and launch of LightBench\u00ae Discover is a significant achievement for the Novacyt team, and I would like to congratulate everyone for their efforts. LightBench\u00ae Discover's\n3-in-1 technology provides cost efficiencies, enhances quality control, simplifies workflows and delivers high-accuracy analytics which have all been designed around our customer needs. This new offering from Novacyt will only further strengthen our existing partnerships and keep us at the forefront of genomic research.\"\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nDeutsche Numis\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Michael Palser\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nPaul McManus / Lianne Applegarth\nAlice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7584 391 303\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.

(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), an international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, announces its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe Company has a broad technology portfolio divided into three business segments: Clinical, Instrumentation and Research Use Only ('RUO'). These business segments trade within Yourgene Health (\"Yourgene\") (78% of total sales FY24) and Primer Design (22% of total sales FY24), focused on the development and commercialisation of clinical products and RUO assays respectively.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nGroup statutory revenue for FY2024 was \u00a319.6m, in line with guidance, representing a YoY growth of 85%, driven by the acquisition of Yourgene (FY2023*: \u00a310.6m)\n\u00b7\nYourgene delivered solid growth in both the clinical and instrumentation segments, including:\n- Reproductive Health up 26% YoY on a proforma basis\n- Ranger \u00ae Technology (\"Ranger\") consumables up 13% YoY on a proforma basis\n\u00b7\nPrimer Design was broadly flat YoY (excluding COVID sales), delivering sales of \u00a34.3m in FY2024\n\u00b7\nGroup gross profit totalled \u00a332.1m (163% margin) in FY2024 (FY2023*: \u00a33.5m (33% margin)).

Autosomal markers are used to detect the three most common viable autosomal trisomies: trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards' syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome). The chosen markers are highly informative with results obtained in >99% of samples.\nIVDR ensures that the Yourgene\u00ae QST*R\nBase\nassay, which is manufactured for sale in the EU, is assessed against stringent quality, safety and performance requirements. Manufacturers must provide considerable evidence of scientific validity, as well as data demonstrating analytical and clinical performance of the tests. The Yourgene\u00ae QST*R\nBase\nassay was assessed by British Standards Institution (BSI), an independent conformity assessment body, and was shown to conform to the new regulations.\nLyn Rees, CEO of Novacyt, commented:\n\"\nThis is the third IVDR accreditation for Novacyt which further demonstrates the high quality and accuracy of our products, and our team's ability to navigate the stringent new regulatory environment for in vitro\ndiagnostic tests. Novacyt has a range of tests for the reproductive health lifecycle and the QST*R Base test is complementary to our NIPT tests providing a follow-on confirmatory test after a high risk NIPT result. We are very proud to have developed an\nassay that provides\naccurate and reliable results during a stressful time in the pregnancy for expecting parents.\"\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nDeutsche Numis\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Michael Palser\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nPaul McManus / Lianne Applegarth\nPhillip Marriage / Alice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7584 391 303\n+44 (0)7867 984 082 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.\nThe Company\ndevelops, manufactures, and commercialises\na range of molecular assays and instrumentation to deliver workflows and services that enable seamless end-to-end solutions from sample to result across multiple sectors including human health, animal health\nand environmental.\nThe Company is divided into three business segments:\nClinical\nBroad portfolio of human clinical\nin vitro\ndiagnostic products, workflows and services focused on three therapeutic areas:\n\u00b7\nReproductive Health: NIPT, Cystic Fibrosis and other rapid aneuploidy tests\n\u00b7\nPrecision Medicine: DPYD genotyping assay\n\u00b7\nInfectious Diseases: Winterplex, multiplex winter respiratory PCR panel\nInstrumentation\nPortfolio of next generation size selection DNA sample preparation platforms and rapid\nPCR machines, including:\n\u00b7\nRanger\u00ae Technology: automated DNA sample preparation and target enrichment technology\n\u00b7\ngenesig q16 and q32 real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) instruments\nResearch Use Only\nRange of services for the life sciences industry:\n\u00b7\nDesign, manufacture, and supply of high-performance qPCR assays and workflows for use in human health, agriculture, veterinary and environmental, to support global health organisations and the research industry\n\u00b7\nPharmaceutical research services: whole genome sequencing (WGS) / whole exome sequencing (WES)\nNovacyt is headquartered in Le V\u00e9sinet in France with offices in the Manchester, UK, Singapore, the US and Canada and has a commercial prese",

For its NIPT technologies customers, Novacyt continues to strengthen its competitive position in the NIPT market with a series of upgrades to the IONA Nx NIPT workflow, which now has the capability to run twice the samples in one run than previously possible. In October 2024, Novacyt held its IONA Nx NIPT User Meeting in Paris which provided valuable customer insights to enable the development of future NIPT roadmaps. The commercial team also worked closely with its first NIPT workflow customer, Genetix in Colombia, for the commercial launch of its NIPT service offering to clinics in the region. In addition, the commercial team supported a new NIPT customer with a launch and educational awareness event in Kazakhstan to drive clinical demand within local clinics and hospitals.\nThe Group has also developed additional analysis capabilities, initially as a research use only (\"RUO\") tool, to expand Novacyt's NIPT offering, including copy number variation (\"CNV\") analysis for its IONA Nx NIPT Workflow, to meet the changing market needs of some of the Company's European lab customers. The RUO tool is expected to be released later this month, with a planned IVDR submission next year.\nIn December 2024, the Group launched an mpox (monkeypox) clade differentiation kit that is used for surveillance and monitoring, rather than being used for actually detecting mpox in patient samples. Due to the competitive nature of the mpox testing market, this new differentiation kit enables Novacyt to provide a unique value proposition to a niche customer segment that is reviewing mpox trends. As stated in the Group's interim results in September 2024, whilst sales of Novacyt's two mpox assays are being generated, these are not material and the Group does not expect this to change in the near term.\nInstrumentation\nNovacyt expects to report 13% growth for its Ranger consumables, year-on-year, which will benefit the gross margin of the Group. This positive trajectory is expected to continue as the Group looks to launch a new Ranger Technology platform for customers carrying out long read sequencing, during this calendar year, and the Company is currently working on the go-to-market and commercial product launch roll-out plans.\nRUO\nIn November 2024, the Group launched two new multiplex assays for gastrointestinal disease in dogs and cats, providing veterinarians with results in less than three hours, enabling quicker, more comprehensive results and ensuring faster treatment.\u00a0Adding these assays to the 200+ assays in Primer Design's existing portfolio demonstrates the Group's commitment to being at the forefront of emerging diagnostics needs. The Group is currently working on enhancing its route to market for the Primer Design portfolio, through the development of an e-commerce platform and optimising its distribution network for growth.\nRegulatory / R&D update\nThe latest assay to be submitted to BSI for IVDR accreditation is the Yourgene\u00ae QST*R Base test; the review is progressing well and the Group expe",

Each target has been carefully selected to detect a key pathogen that can cause potentially serious or life-threatening GI illnesses in cats and dogs.\nTesting for six pathogens using one sample will reduce hands-on time for laboratory technicians as well as the use of consumables. The kits provide results in less than three hours, enabling quicker, more comprehensive results to the veterinarian and ensuring faster treatment for the family pet.\nIf you are attending the London Vet Show and would like further information on the new genesig\u00aePLEX kits for Canine and Feline Gastrointestinal (GI) Diseases, or Novacyt's wider portfolio of veterinary assays, the Novacyt team can be found at Booth No A49.\nLyn Rees, CEO of Novacyt, said:\n\"Following consultation with our customers and further market research, we saw clear demand in the veterinary industry for multiplex assays that target several companion animal pathogens using a single sample. With the launch of our two new genesig\u00aePLEX kits for cats and dogs, we are making testing for these gastrointestinal pathogens more cost-effective, faster and less hands-on for laboratories, and enabling quicker results for veterinarians.\n\"Adding to the 200+ veterinary assays in Primer Design's existing portfolio, these tests demonstrate our continued commitment to identifying emerging diagnostic needs and providing best-in-class solutions for our customers.\"\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nDeutsche Numis\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Michael Palser\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nPaul McManus / Lianne Applegarth\nPhillip Marriage / Alice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7584 391 303\n+44 (0)7867 984 082 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.\nThe Company\ndevelops, manufactures, and commercialises\na range of molecular assays and instrumentation to deliver workflows and services that enable seamless end-to-end solutions from sample to result across multiple sectors including human health, animal health\nand environmental.\nThe Company is divided into three business segments:\nClinical\nBroad portfolio of human clinical\nin vitro\ndiagnostic products, workflows and services focused on three therapeutic areas:\n\u00b7\nReproductive Health: NIPT, Cystic Fibrosis and other rapid aneuploidy tests\n\u00b7\nPrecision Medicine: DPYD genotyping assay\n\u00b7\nInfectious Diseases: Winterplex, multiplex winter respiratory PCR panel\nInstrumentation\nPortfolio of next generation size selection DNA sample preparation platforms and rapid\nPCR machines, including:\n\u00b7\nRanger\u00ae Technology: automated DNA sample preparation and target enrichment technology\n\u00b7\ngenesig q16 and q32 real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) instruments\nResearch Use Only\nRange of services for the life sciences industry:\n\u00b7\nDesign, manufacture, and supply of high-performance qPCR assays and workflows for use in human health, agriculture, veterinary and environmental, to support global health organisations and the research industry\n\u00b7\nPharmaceutical research services: whole genome sequencing (WGS) / whole exome sequencing (WES)\nNovacyt is headquartered in V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay in France with offices in the UK (in Eastleigh and Manchester), Singapore, the US and Canada and has a commercial presence in over 65 countries.

Manufacturers must provide considerable evidence of scientific validity, as well as data demonstrating analytical and clinical performance of the tests. The Yourgene\u00ae Cystic Fibrosis\nBase\ntest was assessed by British Standards Institution (BSI), an independent conformity assessment body, and was shown to conform to the new regulations.\nCystic Fibrosis (\"CF\") has become the most common life-shortening hereditary genetic condition affecting 1 in 2,500 live births in Caucasians. In the UK, all newborns are screened for CF as part of the newborn blood spot test. The test is performed within the first three days of a baby's life and involves pricking the baby's heel and collecting a few drops of blood on a card. The blood is then tested for CF and other rare conditions. The Yourgene\u00ae Cystic Fibrosis\nBase\nassay uses Amplification-Refractory Mutation System technology and genetic analysers to detect point mutations, insertions or deletions in DNA. The assay is designed with all clinically relevant diagnostic scenarios in mind such as carrier screening, newborn screening and male factor infertility testing.\nThe Yourgene\u00ae Cystic Fibrosis\nBase\ntest, part of Yourgene's Reproductive Health portfolio, is used to identify patients with any of the 50 most common CF mutations in the European population.\nLyn Rees, CEO of Novacyt, commented:\n\"\nThis is the second product within the now enlarged Novacyt product portfolio to conform to the new EU IVDR regulations and is one of the first IVDR CF tests on the market. Conformity with IVDR provides clinicians and patients with additional confidence in the high-quality and accuracy of our test which is increasingly becoming an essential test in the detection and diagnosis of CF.\n\"CF testing is prevalent globally and there has recently been an increase in some regions due to increased reimbursement. This includes Australia where the Australian government have introduced a nationwide reimbursement pathway that enables all eligible Australians to receive CF screening either prior to, or early in pregnancy. With increasing momentum in this market, the IVDR accreditation only further validates the quality of our test within the EU and beyond.\"\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nDeutsche Numis\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Michael Palser\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nStephanie Cuthbert / Paul McManus /\nPhillip Marriage / Alice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7796 794 663 / +44 (0)7980 541 893\n+44 (0)7867 984 082 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.\nThe Company\ndevelops, manufactures, and commercialises\na range of molecular assays and instrumentation to deliver workflows and services that enable seamless end-to-end solutions from sample to result across multiple sectors including human health, animal health\nand environmental.\nThe Company is divided into three business segments:\nClinical\nBroad portfolio of human clinical\nin vitro\ndiagnostic products, workflows and services focused on three therapeutic areas:\n\u00b7\nReproductive Health: NIPT, Cystic Fibrosis and other rapid aneuploidy tests\n\u00b7\nPrecision Medicine: DPYD genotyping assay\n\u00b7\nInfectious Diseases: Winterplex, multiplex winter respiratory PCR panel\nInstrumentation\nPortfolio of next generation size selection DNA sample preparation platforms and rapid\nPCR machines, including:\n\u00b7\nRanger\u00ae Technology: automated DNA sample prep",

(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), an international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, announces the closure of its IT-IS International Limited (\"IT-IS\") subsidiary, effective immediately.\nIT-IS, a Stokesley-based manufacturer of rapid-PCR instruments, was acquired by Novacyt in 2020 to support the Group's response to COVID-19, where it facilitated the full delivery of the Group's contracts during the period. The PCR instrumentation market has since become saturated, with IT-IS subsequently experiencing several consecutive loss-making years. IT-IS contributed \u00a30.3m to the Group's total revenue in H1 2024 (H1 2023: \u00a30.6m).\nThe closure of IT-IS is anticipated to improve the Group's EBITDA position by c. \u00a31.0m annually. A restructuring charge of c. \u00a30.7m is expected in connection with the closure. The entity will be treated as a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 for the 2024 financial year.\nThe Intellectual Property (\"IP\") that exists within IT-IS will be retained to allow Novacyt to continue an ongoing IP infringement dispute with Roche Diagnostics GmbH. The dispute, instigated by IT-IS, dates back over five years and is currently progressing through the German courts. The Group will provide further updates on the dispute when appropriate.\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer of Novacyt, said:\n\"The saturation of the PCR instrument market following the pandemic has put significant pressure on IT-IS. Given the subsequent losses, the Board has made the strategic decision to close the business as we continue to focus on reducing our cost base and rationalising our product and service offering. By taking this step, we are better positioning the Group for future growth and driving value for our shareholders.\"\n\"I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire the IT-IS team for their hard work and dedication over the years.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014.\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nDeutsche Numis\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Michael Palser\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nStephanie Cuthbert / Paul McManus /\nPhillip Marriage / Alice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7796 794 663 / +44 (0)7980 541 893\n+44 (0)7867 984 082 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.\nThe Company\ndevelops, manufactures, and commercialises\na range of molecular assays and instrumentation to deliver workflows and services that enable seamless end-to-end solutions from sample to result across multiple sectors including human health, animal health\nand environmental.\nThe Company is divided into three business segments:\nClinical\nBroad portfolio of human clinical\nin vitro\ndiagnostic products, workflows and services focused on three therapeutic areas:\n\u00b7\nReproductive Health: NIPT, Cystic Fibrosis and other rapid aneuploidy tests\n\u00b7\nPrecision Medicine: DPYD genotyping assay\n\u00b7\nInfectious Diseases: Winterplex, multiplex winter respiratory PCR panel\nInstrumentation\nPortfolio of next generation size selection DNA sample preparation platforms and rapid\nPCR machines, including:\n\u00b7\nRanger\u00ae Technology: automated DNA sample preparation and target enrichment technology\n\u00b7\nMyGo: real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) instruments\nResearch Use Only\nRange of services for the life sciences industry:\n\u00b7\nDesign, manufacture, and supply of high-performance qPCR assays and workflows for use in human health, agriculture, veterinary and environmental, to support global health organisations and the research industry\n\u00b7\nPharmaceutical research services: whole genome sequencing (WGS) / whole exome sequencing (WES)\nNovacyt is headquartered in V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay in France with offices in the UK (in Eastleigh and Manchester), Singapore, the US and Canada and has a commercial presence in over 65 countries.

(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), an international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services,\nannounces an unaudited trading update for the six months ended 30 June 2024.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nUnaudited Group statutory revenue for H1 2024 expected to be circa \u00a310.3 million (H1 2023*: \u00a33.3 million), of which c.\u00a37.8 million relates to Yourgene Health (\"Yourgene\").\no\nH1 2023 proforma revenue excluding COVID-19 sales was \u00a311.4 million\n\u00b7\nEncouraging growth in Reproductive Health (34% YoY increase on a proforma basis) and Non-invasive prenatal testing (\"NIPT\") (5% YoY increase on a proforma basis).\n\u00b7\nCash position at 30 June 2024 was \u00a332.9 million (31 December 2023: \u00a344.1 million), and the Group remains debt free.\n\u00b7\nThe Group is on track to deliver its target acquisition synergies by the end of 2024, reducing the annual cost base by \u00a35.0 million following the acquisition of Yourgene, with the Directors believing further savings can also be made.\n\u00b7\n\u00a35.0 million settlement fee was paid to the Department of Health and Social Care (\"DHSC\") in early July (post-period-end).\n\u00b7\nFollowing the settlement with the DHSC as announced on 11 June 2024,\nthe Group has submitted a request to reclaim circa \u00a312.2 million VAT paid to HMRC relating to DHSC invoices that will now not be paid. The Company believes it is entitled to have all VAT refunded, however there is no guarantee that the claim will be successful and the timing of the refund is currently unknown.\n*excludes any Yourgene revenue as pre-acquisition\nCommercial progress\nClinical\nDuring the period the Company saw 34% growth on a proforma basis in its Reproductive Health business, due to the continued strong uptake of its cystic fibrosis portfolio in Australia, following a nationwide reimbursement pathway by the Australian government. The Company also saw 5% growth in its NIPT technology portfolio, as a number of former Genomic Services NIPT customers established in house laboratories and transitioned to higher margin technology customers for whom the Group now supplies its range of NIPT in vitro diagnostic (\"IVD\") workflows and tests.\nThe Group remains focused on building brand awareness and continues to have a significant presence at key international trade events, which has increased lead generation across the clinical portfolio. The team also hosted an educational summit for 20 distributors at the Company's Manchester facility to educate them on the expanded portfolio and discuss tactical commercial growth strategy across the regions.\nInstrumentation\nRanger\u00ae Technology (\"Ranger\") remains an important part of the business and the Company continues to evaluate new opportunities across new human and non-human applications. Some instrumentation purchases in Ranger have been moved from H1 to H2, and the Group expects to see further evaluation and demonstration projects to mature throughout 2024. In May 2024, Yourgene signed a co-marketing agreement with Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc (\"PacBio\"), a leading developer of high-quality, highly accurate sequencing solutions with a global customer base, and the Company's global teams have sponsored a series of PacBio user meetings in the US and Thailand, enabling the business to demonstrate Ranger to and build relationships with PacBio's customer base, which has expanded the Ranger sales pipeline.\nRUO\nIn June, Primer Design launched a real-time PCR workflow for rapid onsite detection of norovirus in oysters, a serious and growing threat to oyster farmers for which there are no other commercially available tests. The workflow was developed through customer feedback, and provides a user-friendly, cost-effective solution to identify contamination.\nRegulatory/ R&D updates\nIn June 2024, the Company submitted its Yourgene Cystic Fibrosis\nBase\nfor\nIn Vitro\nDiagnostic Regulation (\"IVDR\") review and remains on track to submit future clinical products for IVDR approval.\nIn May 2024, Yourgene was granted a Human Tissue Authority (\"HTA\") Licence, enabling its Genomic Services division to test a wider range of tissue samples further broadening its service offering.\nThe Group has also begun to roll out onsite upgrades to existing customers for its IONA Nx NIPT workflow, with a number of enhancements including the capability to run 96 samples in one run rather than 48, giving IONA Nx a further competitive edge in the NIPT marketplace.\nTaiwan update\nThe Group is in advanced stages of disposing of its\nTaiwanese laboratory business. The deal has been approved by the\nTaiwanese government and is expected to conclude shortly.\nCommenting Lyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\"The first half of 2024 has shown continued progress for us, with our efforts\nfocused towards wor",

Combining the proven reliability of the exsig\u00ae Mag kit and the speed of a next-generation rapid extraction workflow, the kit helps researchers accelerate molecular discovery and pathogen testing from sample to results.\nFinally, Beta testing is underway with international key opinion leaders in the field of precision medicine for Yourgene's\nInsight\nDPYD assay, the enhanced DPYD test which helps identify cancer patients at risk of suffering a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to common chemotherapy.

Because Cambridge University Hospitals has been selected as one of only seven lead trusts responsible for managing the entire \u00a35.175 billion service through 2034, Novacyt's existing role makes it a natural partner for the transition.

There are only 2 shareholders in the BoD, CFO Gibson (9,116 shares) and non. exec. director Jean-Pierre Crinelli (33,981 shares). So out of 7 BoD members only 2 own a miniscule amount of shares (probably not even bought themselves). All of this while Rees is already in place for almost 3 years now, first blaming the \"closed period\" for not owning shares and \"looking forward to being in an open period\". And 4 months ago saying \"I will be investing in Novacyt\". So Rees, when will you finally invest in \"your\" business? Or do you wait before the money runs dry, thinking: I already f-ed up one company maybe I could do it again??",

The only thing i'm verry worried about is that current management is not competent enough to keep Novacyt (Yourgene) without 2 or more \u00a320M  placings. And even then you can doubt if that \u00a330/40 million is enough for them. If you look at the past 2.5 years, their only \"achievement\" is the VAT refund of \u00a37 million (which Novacyt was entitled to anyway, and which was burned within 4 months) and a reduction in the monthly loss from \u00a31,5 to 1 million.",

The next-generation magnetic bead-based kit can be used to extract high-quality DNA and RNA from diverse sample types. The streamlined and adaptable protocol enables efficient nucleic acid purification, helping researchers to move faster from sample to PCR testing, without compromising on yield and purity. The RapidBead Pro kit offers magnetic bead extraction technology which has been optimised for simplicity producing quality extractions with a refined workflow for both manual and automated platforms. The surface activated magnetic particles are specifically designed to capture nucleic acids with high affinity, and combined with a single wash step, allows efficient removal of impurities present in the sample matrix. The nucleic acid is then eluted and ready for use in downstream real-time PCR applications. The simple four-step workflow significantly reduces hands-on time compared to traditional methods, lowering the risk of contamination and providing users with a refined workflow to extract DNA and RNA in less than 20 minutes. The exsig Mag RapidBead Pro Extraction kit can be used with various matrices, such as human samples, veterinary, water, food and environmental material. It is also suitable for challenging sample types, including stool and serum, and efficiently isolates genetic material from RNA viruses, as well as both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The kit is available in two sizes to complement Primerdesign\u2019s genesig\u00ae qPCR kit range, supporting varying throughput requirements. Together, these provide a complete, end-to-end solution that supports reliable and consistent qPCR testing with high sensitivity, helping researchers to have confidence in their results. Lyn Rees, CEO of Novacyt, said: \u201cThe release of the exsig Mag RapidBead Pro Extraction Kit is a key advancement in Primerdesign\u2019s molecular workflow portfolio. The kit sets a new standard for DNA or RNA purification, combining the proven precision and reliability of the exsig Mag Kit with the speed of a next-generation rapid extraction workflow. It is a cost-efficient, end-to-end solution that delivers superior performance, reduces lab time, and delivers greater flexibility, to help researchers accelerate molecular discovery and pathogen testing from sample to results.\u201d Primerdesign\u2019s exsig Mag RapidBead Pro Extraction Kit is available for research use only and can be shipped ambiently worldwide.",

The pcr machines in question being Genesig q16's a Novacyt product. Last time i looked not a single member of staff from Novacyt had liked the post. \u00a310m being the retail value but that's still amounts to a significant number of Q16's. Obviously it must be stock that was warehoused after the DHSC pulled the plug on the 2nd contract. If Biograd have purchased these machines it's still a sale of a few million \u00a3's. Which is material news (as Primerdesign will have a turnover of about \u00a36.5m), but the company doesn't think so. If the company donated them (highly likely as Biograd don't have that sort of cash), why haven't they mentioned this in order to get some good press after all the bad they have had. So either way bought or donated, Novacyt should have released some details on this deal & have chose to not bother. You do wonder what the 200+ employees are doing all day. No doubt we'll get some photo's of the staff enjoying a Christmas lunch with their Christmas jumpers on. Bah Humbug",

My thinking is that the PCR machines were difficult to sell and would have expired for quality control and that's why they have been donated . Lyn Rees and the board have not invested one single penny into Novacyt shares because they know there is no progression in this company . They are in it for prestige , and picking up the high salaries and bonuses until the cash runs out and they move on. I invested \u00a3660K into this company in 2020 and was mislead by Graham Mullis with his promise to investors that Novayt would be a mid cap company following the DHSC winning contracts. But all along he manipulated the market as he wanted to pick up his \u00a310 million Long Term Incentive Plan. A total deceiving person.

Then you have Novacyt, making \u00a3120 million in profits in just 1 year. Afterwards having a cash position of \u00a3102 million in 2021. Cash position end of June 2023 \u00a382 million. 3 July 2023: Novacyt \"takes over\" Yourgene (a.k.a. the reverse takeover) and the new CEO Rees get's installed. Fast forward december 30 2025: cash position of under \u00a320 million and a share price at a post covid all time low. So somehow between June 2023 and december 2025 \u00a362.000.000,00 disappeared into thin air. Yes there was a takeover and fines to be paid and restructuring costs. The money is gone. And despite the great words like \"we are going to increase revenue double digit\" and \"we are streets ahead with our big cash position which we nourish\".. Revenue is stagnant and cash burn still closer to \u00a31.000.000 than to 0. To me that is criminal",

Because Cambridge University Hospitals has been selected as one of only seven lead trusts responsible for managing the entire \u00a35.175 billion service through 2034, Novacyt's existing role makes it a natural partner for the transition. Since their technology is already verified and in use by a lead provider at the exact moment the new framework takes shape, there is a clear path for this supply relationship to continue under the new long-term structure.",

There are only 2 shareholders in the BoD, CFO Gibson (9,116 shares) and non. exec. director Jean-Pierre Crinelli (33,981 shares). So out of 7 BoD members only 2 own a miniscule amount of shares (probably not even bought themselves). All of this while Rees is already in place for almost 3 years now, first blaming the \"closed period\" for not owning shares and \"looking forward to being in an open period\". And 4 months ago saying \"I will be investing in Novacyt\". So Rees, when will you finally invest in \"your\" business? Or do you wait before the money runs dry, thinking: I already f-ed up one company maybe I could do it again??",

If you look at the past 2.5 years, their only \"achievement\" is the VAT refund of \u00a37 million (which Novacyt was entitled to anyway, and which was burned within 4 months) and a reduction in the monthly loss from \u00a31,5 to 1 million.",

So somehow between June 2023 and december 2025 \u00a362.000.000,00 disappeared into thin air. Yes there was a takeover and fines to be paid and restructuring costs. The money is gone. And despite the great words like \"we are going to increase revenue double digit\" and \"we are streets ahead with our big cash position which we nourish\".. Revenue is stagnant and cash burn still closer to \u00a31.000.000 than to 0. To me that is criminal",

So out of 7 BoD members only 2 own a miniscule amount of shares (probably not even bought themselves). All of this while Rees is already in place for almost 3 years now, first blaming the \"closed period\" for not owning shares and \"looking forward to being in an open period\". And 4 months ago saying \"I will be investing in Novacyt\". So Rees, when will you finally invest in \"your\" business? Or do you wait before the money runs dry, thinking: I already f-ed up one company maybe I could do it again??",

It's a huge commitment, with a budget of over \u00a35 billion, showing they're serious about bringing this kind of high-tech medicine to more people. Now, for Novacyt and their Yourgene products, this is a great thing. Instead of constantly chasing smaller contracts, they can focus on supplying these seven big regional centers. They've already done well with the NHS, like when they sold their DPYD kit to NHS Wales for chemo screening, their IONA\u00ae Nx prenatal testing workflow landed a deal with St George's NHS Trust and the June tender win with Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust.

Ive been watching silently for a while, mainly because I've had nothing of any value to add. Any hope I had of seeing a decent return have evaporated, Ive seen all the decent staff leave, the R&D department, once their strongest asset has been eviscerated. I just can't work out what their strategy for future growth is or even what the direction is. All I can see now is rapidly depleting cash in the bank, very little in terms of significant new contracts, distinct lack of new products. Investor relations seem to be non existent I thought it was bad with Salad man but its even worse now. It all started out so brightly too. I could have cashed out and had a healthy 40% profit but greed and believing the then ceo about future prospects got the better of me. So im out, older, wiser and poorer. Im taking my remaining money out whilst I still can. The SP is sure to rocket now ive crystallised my losses. Best of luck to those who remain but all I can see is administration ahead.

(No sign of that) Increased Market Coverage: Different brokers often specialize in different sectors, providing broader, more comprehensive research and analysis. (Unknown) Specialized Expertise: A joint broker can provide additional expertise, such as in specific, niche markets or with particular types of investors (e.g., private client brokers). (No sign of that) Capital Raising Support: While one broker may lead, a joint broker can strengthen the syndicate for fundraising, bringing in more capital. (No need for capital as business has Millions in the bank. Unless looking to acquire another business. Highly likely looking at Lyn Rees history of buying business rather than building it) Improved Attention: For smaller, high-growth companies, a second broker ensures the company receives more attention, which is crucial for trading activity.

          "content": "LOL Thanks Brent, My overriding emotion is just sadness tbh. The potential they had was impressive in the Covid days. I still stand by my comments from that time, their R&D was exquisite. I was seriously impressed. Primerdesign had so much potential at that time. I also still stand by the comments regarding the efficacy of their Covid tests. I can probably come clean now but both myself and my partner worked with their products, if you were a competent scientist, there were no problems with either their instruments or the test kits. We were on the calls with NHSE working group listening to all the issues which we never experienced. The move from EXSIG to GENESIG made it even easier to use. It was used routinely in our lab with no issues. EXSIG was very exacting and not really suitable for a very busy lab, I did say this at the time on here and was roundly shouted down by some. Thats why genesig was developed, amazingly quickly. That resolved most of the issues. I could go on but won't. Suffice to say that bad comms and politics and corruption got in the way. Im surprised that nova seemed to roll over and accept the failings levelled at them. We used it with no problems. Our opinions were never sought regarding its validity which I thought was frankly bizarre. Mullis left with his millions, then Salad man (what was that all about) who ran the company v badly. From previous experience, I'd say the board are now just old journeymen, doing nothing, taking inflated salaries until the money runs out. I invested in 2020, im not 100% sure but I think in all that time hardly any board members bought into their own company. As with so many AIM companies, they had great products, great R&D and were let down by the CEO, CFO & the rest of the board. Hard lessen to learn, ive lost over 5 figures. I made it up in other ventures but still stings.",

Investor relations seem to be non existent I thought it was bad with Salad man but its even worse now. It all started out so brightly too. I could have cashed out and had a healthy 40% profit but greed and believing the then ceo about future prospects got the better of me. So im out, older, wiser and poorer.

I still stand by my comments from that time, their R&D was exquisite. I was seriously impressed. Primerdesign had so much potential at that time. I also still stand by the comments regarding the efficacy of their Covid tests. I can probably come clean now but both myself and my partner worked with their products, if you were a competent scientist, there were no problems with either their instruments or the test kits. We were on the calls with NHSE working group listening to all the issues which we never experienced. The move from EXSIG to GENESIG made it even easier to use. It was used routinely in our lab with no issues. EXSIG was very exacting and not really suitable for a very busy lab, I did say this at the time on here and was roundly shouted down by some. Thats why genesig was developed, amazingly quickly. That resolved most of the issues. I could go on but won't. Suffice to say that bad comms and politics and corruption got in the way. Im surprised that nova seemed to roll over and accept the failings levelled at them. We used it with no problems. Our opinions were never sought regarding its validity which I thought was frankly bizarre. Mullis left with his millions, then Salad man (what was that all about) who ran the company v badly. From previous experience, I'd say the board are now just old journeymen, doing nothing, taking inflated salaries until the money runs out. I invested in 2020, im not 100% sure but I think in all that time hardly any board members bought into their own company. As with so many AIM companies, they had great products, great R&D and were let down by the CEO, CFO & the rest of the board. Hard lessen to learn, ive lost over 5 figures. I made it up in other ventures but still stings.",

I just can't work out what their strategy for future growth is or even what the direction is. All I can see now is rapidly depleting cash in the bank, very little in terms of significant new contracts, distinct lack of new products. Investor relations seem to be non existent I thought it was bad with Salad man but its even worse now. It all started out so brightly too. I could have cashed out and had a healthy 40% profit but greed and believing the then ceo about future prospects got the better of me. So im out, older, wiser and poorer. Im taking my remaining money out whilst I still can. The SP is sure to rocket now ive crystallised my losses. Best of luck to those who remain but all I can see is administration ahead.

I still stand by my comments from that time, their R&D was exquisite. I was seriously impressed. Primerdesign had so much potential at that time. I also still stand by the comments regarding the efficacy of their Covid tests. I can probably come clean now but both myself and my partner worked with their products, if you were a competent scientist, there were no problems with either their instruments or the test kits. We were on the calls with NHSE working group listening to all the issues which we never experienced. The move from EXSIG to GENESIG made it even easier to use. It was used routinely in our lab with no issues. EXSIG was very exacting and not really suitable for a very busy lab, I did say this at the time on here and was roundly shouted down by some. Thats why genesig was developed, amazingly quickly. That resolved most of the issues. I could go on but won't. Suffice to say that bad comms and politics and corruption got in the way. Im surprised that nova seemed to roll over and accept the failings levelled at them. We used it with no problems. Our opinions were never sought regarding its validity which I thought was frankly bizarre. Mullis left with his millions, then Salad man (what was that all about) who ran the company v badly. From previous experience, I'd say the board are now just old journeymen, doing nothing, taking inflated salaries until the money runs out. I invested in 2020, im not 100% sure but I think in all that time hardly any board members bought into their own company. As with so many AIM companies, they had great products, great R&D and were let down by the CEO, CFO & the rest of the board. Hard lessen to learn, ive lost over 5 figures. I made it up in other ventures but still stings.",

Ive finally taken my leave of this god forsaken company. Took a loss, im putting it down as a learning experience. Ive been watching silently for a while, mainly because I've had nothing of any value to add. Any hope I had of seeing a decent return have evaporated, Ive seen all the decent staff leave, the R&D department, once their strongest asset has been eviscerated. I just can't work out what their strategy for future growth is or even what the direction is. All I can see now is rapidly depleting cash in the bank, very little in terms of significant new contracts, distinct lack of new products. Investor relations seem to be non existent I thought it was bad with Salad man but its even worse now. It all started out so brightly too. I could have cashed out and had a healthy 40% profit but greed and believing the then ceo about future prospects got the better of me. So im out, older, wiser and poorer. Im taking my remaining money out whilst I still can. The SP is sure to rocket now ive crystallised my losses. Best of luck to those who remain but all I can see is administration ahead. Message ends.",

Key reasons for appointing a joint broker include: Enhanced Investor Distribution & Reach: A second broker can provide complementary contacts and access to a wider investor base, helping with liquidity and share price performance. (No sign of that) Increased Market Coverage: Different brokers often specialize in different sectors, providing broader, more comprehensive research and analysis. (Unknown) Specialized Expertise: A joint broker can provide additional expertise, such as in specific, niche markets or with particular types of investors (e.g., private client brokers). (No sign of that) Capital Raising Support: While one broker may lead, a joint broker can strengthen the syndicate for fundraising, bringing in more capital. (No need for capital as business has Millions in the bank. Unless looking to acquire another business. Highly likely looking at Lyn Rees history of buying business rather than building it) Improved Attention: For smaller, high-growth companies, a second broker ensures the company receives more attention, which is crucial for trading activity. (No sign of that) While it is more common for larger AIM companies to use joint brokers, it is still relatively rare, with only about 5% of AIM companies having more than one.",

I still stand by my comments from that time, their R&D was exquisite. I was seriously impressed. Primerdesign had so much potential at that time. I also still stand by the comments regarding the efficacy of their Covid tests. I can probably come clean now but both myself and my partner worked with their products, if you were a competent scientist, there were no problems with either their instruments or the test kits. We were on the calls with NHSE working group listening to all the issues which we never experienced. The move from EXSIG to GENESIG made it even easier to use. It was used routinely in our lab with no issues. EXSIG was very exacting and not really suitable for a very busy lab, I did say this at the time on here and was roundly shouted down by some. Thats why genesig was developed, amazingly quickly. That resolved most of the issues. I could go on but won't. Suffice to say that bad comms and politics and corruption got in the way. Im surprised that nova seemed to roll over and accept the failings levelled at them. We used it with no problems. Our opinions were never sought regarding its validity which I thought was frankly bizarre. Mullis left with his millions, then Salad man (what was that all about) who ran the company v badly. From previous experience, I'd say the board are now just old journeymen, doing nothing, taking inflated salaries until the money runs out. I invested in 2020, im not 100% sure but I think in all that time hardly any board members bought into their own company. As with so many AIM companies, they had great products, great R&D and were let down by the CEO, CFO & the rest of the board. Hard lessen to learn, ive lost over 5 figures. I made it up in other ventures but still stings.",

Ive been watching silently for a while, mainly because I've had nothing of any value to add. Any hope I had of seeing a decent return have evaporated, Ive seen all the decent staff leave, the R&D department, once their strongest asset has been eviscerated. I just can't work out what their strategy for future growth is or even what the direction is. All I can see now is rapidly depleting cash in the bank, very little in terms of significant new contracts, distinct lack of new products. Investor relations seem to be non existent I thought it was bad with Salad man but its even worse now. It all started out so brightly too. I could have cashed out and had a healthy 40% profit but greed and believing the then ceo about future prospects got the better of me. So im out, older, wiser and poorer. Im taking my remaining money out whilst I still can. The SP is sure to rocket now ive crystallised my losses. Best of luck to those who remain but all I can see is administration ahead.

(No sign of that) Increased Market Coverage: Different brokers often specialize in different sectors, providing broader, more comprehensive research and analysis. (Unknown) Specialized Expertise: A joint broker can provide additional expertise, such as in specific, niche markets or with particular types of investors (e.g., private client brokers). (No sign of that) Capital Raising Support: While one broker may lead, a joint broker can strengthen the syndicate for fundraising, bringing in more capital. (No need for capital as business has Millions in the bank. Unless looking to acquire another business. Highly likely looking at Lyn Rees history of buying business rather than building it) Improved Attention: For smaller, high-growth companies, a second broker ensures the company receives more attention, which is crucial for trading activity.

Or make better decisions and invest in a company involving Artificial Intelligence for diagnostic testing . Just putting that \u00a3110 million in the bank would generate a lot of interest \u00a35 million plus per year",

I still stand by my comments from that time, their R&D was exquisite. I was seriously impressed. Primerdesign had so much potential at that time. I also still stand by the comments regarding the efficacy of their Covid tests. I can probably come clean now but both myself and my partner worked with their products, if you were a competent scientist, there were no problems with either their instruments or the test kits. We were on the calls with NHSE working group listening to all the issues which we never experienced. The move from EXSIG to GENESIG made it even easier to use. It was used routinely in our lab with no issues. EXSIG was very exacting and not really suitable for a very busy lab, I did say this at the time on here and was roundly shouted down by some. Thats why genesig was developed, amazingly quickly. That resolved most of the issues. I could go on but won't. Suffice to say that bad comms and politics and corruption got in the way. Im surprised that nova seemed to roll over and accept the failings levelled at them. We used it with no problems. Our opinions were never sought regarding its validity which I thought was frankly bizarre. Mullis left with his millions, then Salad man (what was that all about) who ran the company v badly. From previous experience, I'd say the board are now just old journeymen, doing nothing, taking inflated salaries until the money runs out. I invested in 2020, im not 100% sure but I think in all that time hardly any board members bought into their own company. As with so many AIM companies, they had great products, great R&D and were let down by the CEO, CFO & the rest of the board. Hard lessen to learn, ive lost over 5 figures. I made it up in other ventures but still stings.",

I just can't work out what their strategy for future growth is or even what the direction is. All I can see now is rapidly depleting cash in the bank, very little in terms of significant new contracts, distinct lack of new products. Investor relations seem to be non existent I thought it was bad with Salad man but its even worse now. It all started out so brightly too. I could have cashed out and had a healthy 40% profit but greed and believing the then ceo about future prospects got the better of me. So im out, older, wiser and poorer. Im taking my remaining money out whilst I still can. The SP is sure to rocket now ive crystallised my losses. Best of luck to those who remain but all I can see is administration ahead.
