Since its launch in July 2025, the Company has successfully placed 10 instruments, with multiple collaborations secured and demonstrations to customers delivered. The Group confirms a healthy pipeline of opportunities for 2026 and beyond, as customers proactively reach out to learn more about this technology.\nDespite the\ndecline in sales within the Company's RUO segment, the Group successfully launched Primerdesign exsig\u00ae Mag RapidBead Pro Extraction Kit in November 2025. The cost-efficient, end-to-end solution, delivers superior performance for the Group's partners, setting a new standard for DNA/RNA purification. Combining the proven reliability of the exsig\u00ae Mag kit and the speed of a next-generation rapid extraction workflow, the kit helps researchers accelerate molecular discovery and pathogen testing from sample to results.\nFinally, Beta testing is underway with international key opinion leaders in the field of precision medicine for Yourgene's\nInsight\nDPYD assay, the enhanced DPYD test which helps identify cancer patients at risk of suffering a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to common chemotherapy. This Beta testing has commenced in good time, ahead of the product launch expected in H1 2026.\nFinal results\nThe Group expects to report its full year results for the year ended 31 December 2025 during April 2026.\nCommenting on the trading update Lyn Rees, CEO of Novacyt, said:\n\"With the period of restructuring and integration completed, and the successful derisked and stabilised business formed, we committed as a Board to deliver top line growth. We're therefore pleased to have delivered year on year revenue growth in line with market expectations. It's also pleasing to report two consecutive periods of half-year growth underpinned by an upward trajectory of revenue growth.

(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), the international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, announces it will issue an investor presentation today via the Investor Meet Company platform, detailing the Company's growth plan, providing FY25 outlook and will set out its strategic goals, as detailed below.\nFY25 outlook\nNovacyt expects to see a slight increase in H2 2025 revenues vs H1 2025, driven primarily by increased instrument sales, with new orders received from the recently launched LightBench\u00ae Discover instrument. The Group expects to report an improvement in EBITDA loss for 2025 compared to the loss reported in FY24 of \u00a39.1m which will be supported by an improved gross margin contribution. Cash outflow is also expected to improve in H2 2025 and will be lower than the H1 2025 cash outflow of \u00a36.8m, largely as a result of completing the site consolidation and restructuring work.\nOrganic financial goals\nNovacyt has set out and committed to the following three organic KPIs, clearly defined below:\n1) To deliver double digit revenue growth year-on-year (from FY26)\n2) To deliver a gross margin across the Group of over 60% each year (H1 FY25 66%)\n3) To achieve EBITDA profitability based on the organic growth plans supported by the Company's balance sheet strength as soon as possible\nGrowth strategy\nFollowing a period of restructuring, reducing the cost base and rightsizing the Group's operational footprint, the business is now derisked with a strong core business and foundations for growth. Novacyt has an established customer base in key markets and a robust commercialisation strategy to drive the business forward with the ability to rapidly pivot and leverage the Group's core capabilities to meet emerging market needs.\nIn 2024, the Company agreed to invest up to \u00a32m per year from 2025-2027 to accelerate bringing new products to market. Novacyt continues to execute this strategy with product launches such as LightBench\u00ae Discover in July 2025, to support PacBio's labs using long read sequencers and the APAC focused NIPT solution which was launched in Q4 2025 to meet the changing needs of the APAC market. Through a mixed model strategy of licensing external technologies and building the Group's own products in-house, alongside strong partnerships and collaborations with blue chip partners, Novacyt has created a solid foundation from which it can deliver top line growth to support it reaching EBITDA profitability.\nInvestor presentation\nThe investor presentation will be issued on Wednesday 22 October at 7.00am BST and include presentations from Lyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer, and Steve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer, who will talk through the interim results for the six months ended 30 June, the organic financial targets set out by the Company above and how the Group is well positioned for growth. The presentation will also feature contributions from both Dr. Jo Mason, Chief Scientific Officer, and Maria Watters, Chief Commercial Officer, who will discuss the New Product Introduction strategy of the Group and Commercialisation.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and register\nhere\n.\nThe presentation will be made available on the Company's website here -\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors/presentations/\nShareholders and interested parties can sign up to receive the latest Company's announcements and updates by emailing:\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n.\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nSinger Capital Markets\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 7496 3000\nTom Salvesen / Phil Davies / James Fischer / Samed Ethemi\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nPaul McManus / Lianne Applegarth\nAlice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7980 541 893 / +44 (0)7584 391 303\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.
