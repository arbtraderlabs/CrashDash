(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), the international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, announces it will issue an investor presentation today via the Investor Meet Company platform, detailing the Company's growth plan, providing FY25 outlook and will set out its strategic goals, as detailed below.\nFY25 outlook\nNovacyt expects to see a slight increase in H2 2025 revenues vs H1 2025, driven primarily by increased instrument sales, with new orders received from the recently launched LightBench\u00ae Discover instrument. The Group expects to report an improvement in EBITDA loss for 2025 compared to the loss reported in FY24 of \u00a39.1m which will be supported by an improved gross margin contribution. Cash outflow is also expected to improve in H2 2025 and will be lower than the H1 2025 cash outflow of \u00a36.8m, largely as a result of completing the site consolidation and restructuring work.\nOrganic financial goals\nNovacyt has set out and committed to the following three organic KPIs, clearly defined below:\n1) To deliver double digit revenue growth year-on-year (from FY26)\n2) To deliver a gross margin across the Group of over 60% each year (H1 FY25 66%)\n3) To achieve EBITDA profitability based on the organic growth plans supported by the Company's balance sheet strength as soon as possible\nGrowth strategy\nFollowing a period of restructuring, reducing the cost base and rightsizing the Group's operational footprint, the business is now derisked with a strong core business and foundations for growth. Novacyt has an established customer base in key markets and a robust commercialisation strategy to drive the business forward with the ability to rapidly pivot and leverage the Group's core capabilities to meet emerging market needs.\nIn 2024, the Company agreed to invest up to \u00a32m per year from 2025-2027 to accelerate bringing new products to market. Novacyt continues to execute this strategy with product launches such as LightBench\u00ae Discover in July 2025, to support PacBio's labs using long read sequencers and the APAC focused NIPT solution which was launched in Q4 2025 to meet the changing needs of the APAC market. Through a mixed model strategy of licensing external technologies and building the Group's own products in-house, alongside strong partnerships and collaborations with blue chip partners, Novacyt has created a solid foundation from which it can deliver top line growth to support it reaching EBITDA profitability.\nInvestor presentation\nThe investor presentation will be issued on Wednesday 22 October at 7.00am BST and include presentations from Lyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer, and Steve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer, who will talk through the interim results for the six months ended 30 June, the organic financial targets set out by the Company above and how the Group is well positioned for growth.
