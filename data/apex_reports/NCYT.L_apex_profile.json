(EURONEXT GROWTH: ALNOV; AIM: NCYT), an international molecular diagnostics company with a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, announces the closure of its IT-IS International Limited (\"IT-IS\") subsidiary, effective immediately.\nIT-IS, a Stokesley-based manufacturer of rapid-PCR instruments, was acquired by Novacyt in 2020 to support the Group's response to COVID-19, where it facilitated the full delivery of the Group's contracts during the period. The PCR instrumentation market has since become saturated, with IT-IS subsequently experiencing several consecutive loss-making years. IT-IS contributed \u00a30.3m to the Group's total revenue in H1 2024 (H1 2023: \u00a30.6m).\nThe closure of IT-IS is anticipated to improve the Group's EBITDA position by c. \u00a31.0m annually. A restructuring charge of c. \u00a30.7m is expected in connection with the closure. The entity will be treated as a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 for the 2024 financial year.\nThe Intellectual Property (\"IP\") that exists within IT-IS will be retained to allow Novacyt to continue an ongoing IP infringement dispute with Roche Diagnostics GmbH. The dispute, instigated by IT-IS, dates back over five years and is currently progressing through the German courts. The Group will provide further updates on the dispute when appropriate.\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer of Novacyt, said:\n\"The saturation of the PCR instrument market following the pandemic has put significant pressure on IT-IS. Given the subsequent losses, the Board has made the strategic decision to close the business as we continue to focus on reducing our cost base and rationalising our product and service offering. By taking this step, we are better positioning the Group for future growth and driving value for our shareholders.\"\n\"I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire the IT-IS team for their hard work and dedication over the years.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014.\nContacts\nNovacyt SA\nhttps://novacyt.com/investors\nLyn Rees, Chief Executive Officer\nVia Walbrook PR\nSteve Gibson, Chief Financial Officer\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nVadim Alexandre / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nDeutsche Numis\n(Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Michael Palser\nAllegra Finance (French Listing Sponsor)\nR\u00e9mi Durgetto / Yannick Petit\n+33 (1) 42 22 10 10\nr.durgetto@allegrafinance.com\n/\ny.petit@allegrafinance.com\nWalbrook PR (Financial PR & IR)\nStephanie Cuthbert / Paul McManus /\nPhillip Marriage / Alice Woodings\n+44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\nnovacyt@walbrookpr.com\n+44 (0)7796 794 663 / +44 (0)7980 541 893\n+44 (0)7867 984 082 / +44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Novacyt Group\n(\nwww.novacyt.com\n)\nNovacyt is an international molecular diagnostics company providing a broad portfolio of integrated technologies and services, primarily focused on the delivery of genomic medicine.\nThe Company\ndevelops, manufactures, and commercialises\na range of molecular assays and instrumentation to deliver workflows and services that enable seamless end-to-end solutions from sample to result across multiple sectors including human health, animal health\nand environmental.\nThe Company is divided into three business segments:\nClinical\nBroad portfolio of human clinical\nin vitro\ndiagnostic products, workflows and services focused on three therapeutic areas:\n\u00b7\nReproductive Health: NIPT, Cystic Fibrosis and other rapid aneuploidy tests\n\u00b7\nPrecision Medicine: DPYD genotyping assay\n\u00b7\nInfectious Diseases: Winterplex, multiplex winter respiratory PCR panel\nInstrumentation\nPortfolio of next generation size selection DNA sample preparation platforms and rapid\nPCR machines, including:\n\u00b7\nRanger\u00ae Technology: automated DNA sample preparation and target enrichment technology\n\u00b7\nMyGo: real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) instruments\nResearch Use Only\nRange of services for the life sciences industry:\n\u00b7\nDesign, manufacture, and supply of high-performance qPCR assays and workflows for use in human health, agriculture, veterinary and environmental, to support global health organisations and the research industry\n\u00b7\nPharmaceutical research services: whole genome sequencing (WGS) / whole exome sequencing (WES)\nNovacyt is headquartered in V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay in France with offices in the UK (in Eastleigh and Manchester), Singapore, the US and Canada and has a commercial presence in over 65 countries.
