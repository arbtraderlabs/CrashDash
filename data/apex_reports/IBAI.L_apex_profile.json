While the trial remains open as one patient continues to receive treatment, enrollment was formally closed in November. The study authors are currently preparing the Phase 1 results for submission to a peer\u2011reviewed journal.\nThe directors believe it is no longer in shareholders' interests to embark on\na Phase 2 clinical trial of gallium maltolate\nas previously intended\n.\nThe financial\nand operational resources\nwould be better employed to concentrate upon nearer-term commercial objectives of our imaging solutions.\nT\nhe Company continues to hold two orphan drug designations, two rare pediatric disease designations, and an FDA Fast Track designation, all of which remain valuable assets that preserve future optionality.\nWe also acknowledge the GABRIEL pediatric trial-Gallium Maltolate for Better Outcomes in Relapsed/Refractory Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor and High\u2011Grade Glioma-\nplanned a\nt Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Imaging Biometrics is not formally involved in this study, but we\nwill\nclosely monitor its progress\nfor\nany scientific insights that may emerge. Developments from this trial may help inform the broader landscape of research related to gallium maltolate, and we will continue to follow it with interest.\nOur decision reflects a disciplined commitment to focus-ensuring that we invest where we can deliver the greatest value for patients, clinicians, and shareholders in the near term. The imaging business is\npromising\nstrong\ner\ncommercial performance, expanding clinical adoption, and increasing recognition for its technological differentiation. Concentrating our efforts here allows us to build on this momentum and continue scaling in a way that strengthens the Company's financial foundation and long\u2011term outlook.\n--ENDS\n-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited\n(Broker)\nLucy Williams\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae LLC\n:\nIB is a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Delta T1 maps provide rapid, objective delineation of contrast-enhancing regions, while IB Neuro generates standardized (quantitative) MR DSC perfusion images of relative cerebral blood volume (sRCBV), which eliminates manual tissue normalization. These outputs serve as inputs for Fractional Tumor Burden (FTB) maps, which deliver automated visualization of tumor versus non-tumor tissue and treatment effects within enhancing regions. FTB Express accelerates this process, enabling clinicians to quickly access actionable insights for patient care.\nQSMetric is a patented quantitative susceptibility mapping software that processes gradient echo brain images to visualize tissue structures and measure susceptibility values. This capability supports a broad range of clinical applications, including targeting for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, neurodegenerative disease assessment, multiple sclerosis, and more.\nKatie Anderson, Global MR Visualization Product Manager at GE HealthCare, said, \"We are excited to expand our collaboration with Imaging Biometrics to enable access for our customers to these clinically important capabilities.\"\n--ENDS-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams/Heena Karani\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae\nLLC\nIB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics, Ltd, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Funding for the FTB mapping component was made possible in part by the Musella Foundation for Brain Tumor Research & Information, Inc., whose support continues to accelerate innovation in brain tumor research.\nThis phase 2 feasibility study explores a novel treatment paradigm for patients with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas: administering temozolomide chemotherapy prior to radiation therapy. This innovative approach aims to determine whether early objective response rates-measured before radiation-can serve as reliable surrogates for drug activity. If validated, this paradigm could revolutionize early-phase clinical trial design in neuro-oncology, enabling more efficient drug screening and personalized treatment strategies.\nIB's FTB maps will provide voxel-level classification of tumor tissue based on perfusion characteristics, distinguishing active tumor from necrosis and treatment-related changes - a critical distinction that conventional imaging often fails to make. By comparing baseline and post-treatment FTB maps, deeper insights will be gained into tumor response trajectories and the biological impact of early chemotherapy-particularly in MGMT methylated tumors, which are known to respond more favorably to temozolomide.\n\"FTB mapping gives us a dynamic view of tumor behavior, which will help provide confirmation of response to drug therapy\" said Dr. Bazer.\n\"We're proud to support this trial with our imaging platform and grateful for the financial support from the Musella Foundation,\" said Michael Schmainda, CEO of Imaging Biometrics\n. \"FTB mapping is designed to bring clarity to brain tumor imaging, and we're excited to see it making a difference.\"\n--ENDS\n-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited\n(Broker)\nLucy Williams/Heena Karani\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae LLC\n:\nIB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.
