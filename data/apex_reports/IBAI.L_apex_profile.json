While the trial remains open as one patient continues to receive treatment, enrollment was formally closed in November. The study authors are currently preparing the Phase 1 results for submission to a peer\u2011reviewed journal.\nThe directors believe it is no longer in shareholders' interests to embark on\na Phase 2 clinical trial of gallium maltolate\nas previously intended\n.\nThe financial\nand operational resources\nwould be better employed to concentrate upon nearer-term commercial objectives of our imaging solutions.\nT\nhe Company continues to hold two orphan drug designations, two rare pediatric disease designations, and an FDA Fast Track designation, all of which remain valuable assets that preserve future optionality.\nWe also acknowledge the GABRIEL pediatric trial-Gallium Maltolate for Better Outcomes in Relapsed/Refractory Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor and High\u2011Grade Glioma-\nplanned a\nt Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Imaging Biometrics is not formally involved in this study, but we\nwill\nclosely monitor its progress\nfor\nany scientific insights that may emerge. Developments from this trial may help inform the broader landscape of research related to gallium maltolate, and we will continue to follow it with interest.\nOur decision reflects a disciplined commitment to focus-ensuring that we invest where we can deliver the greatest value for patients, clinicians, and shareholders in the near term. The imaging business is\npromising\nstrong\ner\ncommercial performance, expanding clinical adoption, and increasing recognition for its technological differentiation. Concentrating our efforts here allows us to build on this momentum and continue scaling in a way that strengthens the Company's financial foundation and long\u2011term outlook.\n--ENDS\n-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited\n(Broker)\nLucy Williams\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae LLC\n:\nIB is a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Delta T1 maps provide rapid, objective delineation of contrast-enhancing regions, while IB Neuro generates standardized (quantitative) MR DSC perfusion images of relative cerebral blood volume (sRCBV), which eliminates manual tissue normalization. These outputs serve as inputs for Fractional Tumor Burden (FTB) maps, which deliver automated visualization of tumor versus non-tumor tissue and treatment effects within enhancing regions. FTB Express accelerates this process, enabling clinicians to quickly access actionable insights for patient care.\nQSMetric is a patented quantitative susceptibility mapping software that processes gradient echo brain images to visualize tissue structures and measure susceptibility values. This capability supports a broad range of clinical applications, including targeting for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, neurodegenerative disease assessment, multiple sclerosis, and more.\nKatie Anderson, Global MR Visualization Product Manager at GE HealthCare, said, \"We are excited to expand our collaboration with Imaging Biometrics to enable access for our customers to these clinically important capabilities.\"\n--ENDS-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited (Broker)\nLucy Williams/Heena Karani\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae\nLLC\nIB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics, Ltd, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Funding for the FTB mapping component was made possible in part by the Musella Foundation for Brain Tumor Research & Information, Inc., whose support continues to accelerate innovation in brain tumor research.\nThis phase 2 feasibility study explores a novel treatment paradigm for patients with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas: administering temozolomide chemotherapy prior to radiation therapy. This innovative approach aims to determine whether early objective response rates-measured before radiation-can serve as reliable surrogates for drug activity. If validated, this paradigm could revolutionize early-phase clinical trial design in neuro-oncology, enabling more efficient drug screening and personalized treatment strategies.\nIB's FTB maps will provide voxel-level classification of tumor tissue based on perfusion characteristics, distinguishing active tumor from necrosis and treatment-related changes - a critical distinction that conventional imaging often fails to make. By comparing baseline and post-treatment FTB maps, deeper insights will be gained into tumor response trajectories and the biological impact of early chemotherapy-particularly in MGMT methylated tumors, which are known to respond more favorably to temozolomide.\n\"FTB mapping gives us a dynamic view of tumor behavior, which will help provide confirmation of response to drug therapy\" said Dr. Bazer.\n\"We're proud to support this trial with our imaging platform and grateful for the financial support from the Musella Foundation,\" said Michael Schmainda, CEO of Imaging Biometrics\n. \"FTB mapping is designed to bring clarity to brain tumor imaging, and we're excited to see it making a difference.\"\n--ENDS\n-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited\n(Broker)\nLucy Williams/Heena Karani\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae LLC\n:\nIB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Imaging Biometrics is not formally involved in this study, but we\nwill\nclosely monitor its progress\nfor\nany scientific insights that may emerge. Developments from this trial may help inform the broader landscape of research related to gallium maltolate, and we will continue to follow it with interest.\nOur decision reflects a disciplined commitment to focus-ensuring that we invest where we can deliver the greatest value for patients, clinicians, and shareholders in the near term. The imaging business is\npromising\nstrong\ner\ncommercial performance, expanding clinical adoption, and increasing recognition for its technological differentiation.

Funding for the FTB mapping component was made possible in part by the Musella Foundation for Brain Tumor Research & Information, Inc., whose support continues to accelerate innovation in brain tumor research.\nThis phase 2 feasibility study explores a novel treatment paradigm for patients with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas: administering temozolomide chemotherapy prior to radiation therapy. This innovative approach aims to determine whether early objective response rates-measured before radiation-can serve as reliable surrogates for drug activity. If validated, this paradigm could revolutionize early-phase clinical trial design in neuro-oncology, enabling more efficient drug screening and personalized treatment strategies.\nIB's FTB maps will provide voxel-level classification of tumor tissue based on perfusion characteristics, distinguishing active tumor from necrosis and treatment-related changes - a critical distinction that conventional imaging often fails to make. By comparing baseline and post-treatment FTB maps, deeper insights will be gained into tumor response trajectories and the biological impact of early chemotherapy-particularly in MGMT methylated tumors, which are known to respond more favorably to temozolomide.\n\"FTB mapping gives us a dynamic view of tumor behavior, which will help provide confirmation of response to drug therapy\" said Dr. Bazer.\n\"We're proud to support this trial with our imaging platform and grateful for the financial support from the Musella Foundation,\" said Michael Schmainda, CEO of Imaging Biometrics\n. \"FTB mapping is designed to bring clarity to brain tumor imaging, and we're excited to see it making a difference.\"\n--ENDS\n-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited\n(Broker)\nLucy Williams/Heena Karani\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae LLC\n:\nIB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Its patented technology is used by researchers in academia and drug development and provides a way to model the behaviour of multiple human organs interconnected by a system that mimics the flow of blood in the body. It can significantly increase the physiological relevance of research, helping users generate more accurate models and greatly improve confidence in the validity of their results. The QV1200 system replicates the human physiology more effectively than non-flow systems.\nUnder the terms of a share purchase agreement dated 10 October 2025 (the \"\nSPA\n\"), IBAI has agreed to purchase 86.11% of Kirkstall's entire issued share capital.\nFollowing completion of the sale, Kirkstall's shareholder agreement includes drag-along provisions that would enable IBAI to acquire the remaining shares in Kirkstall not covered by the SPA. It is anticipated that IBAI will exercise these provisions to acquire 100% ownership of Kirkstall.\nThe total consideration for the acquisition of 100% of Kirkstall's entire issued share capital is \u00a3170,000 equivalent to \u00a30.015717 per Kirkstall share (the \"Consideration\"). \u00a3146,421.41 of the Consideration is payable to Truetide (\"\nTruetide\n's Consideration\") and will be satisfied by the issuance of an unsecured Convertible Loan Note (the \"CLN\") by IBAI to Truetide. The CLN has a principal value of \u00a3170,000, and the balance of \u00a323,578.59, which is not Truetide's Consideration, will be subscribed for by Truetide in cash. The cash element will be used by IBAI to pay the remaining shareholders in Kirkstall.\nThe CLN bears interest at 6% per annum, which will accrue and be added to the loan balance. It is unsecured and subordinated, and may be converted into Ordinary Shares of IBAI at the discretion of Truetide, in whole or in part, at the lower of \u00a30.075 (subject to a General Meeting to change the Company's par value) or the subscription price of any fundraising completed by IBAI prior to conversion. The final redemption date is 31 December 2027.\nUnder the terms of the CLN, Truetide may not issue a conversion notice if doing so would result in Truetide, together with any persons deemed to be acting in concert with it (as defined in the UK Takeover Code), holding 30% or more of IBAI's issued share capital (as enlarged by such conversion).\nKirkstall's sales of QV1200 are beginning to grow and move beyond its established UK university customer base. A key target for its products is the US market and to support this, Kirkstall really needs a US partner. We believe that IBAI has the market knowledge and expertise to support Kirkstall's future growth.\nRelated Party Considerations\nTruetide holds a 29.35% interest in the Company, and Trevor Brown is an executive director of both IBAI and Truetide and holds a 27.99% interest in Truetide.\nThe entry by IBAI and Truetide into the SPA and CLN constitutes a material related party transaction for the purposes of DTR 7.3 and was, accordingly, voted upon by the statutory directors of IBAI (the \"Directors\") deemed independent in relation to the SPA, comprising Dr Al Musella, Brett Skelly and Michael Schmainda (excluding Trevor Brown, who constituted a \"related party\" (as such term is defined in IFRS)), and such independent Directors consider the material related party transaction in respect of the SPA and CLN to be fair and reasonable from the perspective of the Company and holders of Ordinary Shares (\"Shareholders\") who are not a related party. Shareholders should note Trevor Brown recused himself from all deliberations concerning the SPA and CLN, ensuring robust governance and full compliance with applicable regulatory standards. These steps reflect the Company's ongoing commitment to transparent corporate governance and robust Shareholder protections\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\n-ENDS-\nFor further information:\nImaging Biometrics Limited\nTel: 01738 587555\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nTel: 020 7469 0936\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

QSMetric is available for immediate sale through IB as an annual license subscription.\nQSMetric, an FDA-cleared MRI technique, measures how tissue responds to magnetic fields, revealing subtle biochemical changes often missed by conventional imaging. It enables clinicians to quantify changes in magnetic susceptibility, offering critical insights into iron deposition, microbleeds, demyelination, calcification, and other markers of disease progression or treatment response. The automated software has clinical applications across neurodegenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis, neurological and psychiatric disorders, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, brain tumours, and more-providing the sensitivity and specificity needed for confident diagnosis.\n\"This agreement brings together MIM's innovation and IB's commercialization strength to accelerate access to a powerful, clinically validated imaging solution,\" said Dr. Yi Wang, PhD, MIM's President. \"The fact that QSMetric is both FDA-cleared and patent-protected underscores its scientific rigor and commercial readiness.\"\nThe collaboration also opens the door to joint development initiatives, including:\n\u00b7\nIntegration of QSMetric with IB's solutions to enhance neuro characterization.\n\u00b7\nExpansion into multi-parametric imaging workflows for neuro-oncology, neurodegeneration, and vascular disorders.\n\u00b7\nCo-development of AI-driven analytics and clinical decision support tools leveraging QSMetric data.\nA recent study published in Radiology demonstrated how QSM measures iron-related pathology, supporting its role in managing\u00a0neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in predicting cognitive decline\n(\nRadiology, Sept 9, 2025\n)\n. As demand for advanced imaging in Alzheimer's care accelerates, QSMetric is well-placed to address a US diagnostics market worth over $3.5 billion. With the rise of FDA-approved anti-amyloid therapies, MRI-based monitoring for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) has become a clinical and regulatory priority. QSMetric's ability to detect and quantify microhemorrhages and iron accumulation independent of imaging parameters (\nRadiology, Jan 1, 2012\n) offers a robust quantitative solution for ARIA-H surveillance-making it a valuable tool for memory clinics, imaging networks, and trial sponsors navigating this rapidly expanding market.\n\"QSMetric is a perfect complement to our portfolio of advanced imaging solutions,\" added Michael Schmainda, IB's CEO. \"We're excited to bring this technology to market and help clinicians unlock deeper insights into brain pathology with greater precision and efficiency.\"\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\n-ENDS-\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometric Limited\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae LLC\n: IB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

Notably, this figure includes a foreign exchange loss of \u00a367,309 and a non-cash share-based payment of \u00a347,982. Adjusting for these items, the Group would have been profitable during the first half of the year.\nIB003, gallium maltolate (GaM)\nFollowing the recently reported \"soft close\" of our Phase 1 clinical trial for oral GaM, we anticipate formal closure approval in the near term. In parallel, our clinical team is actively preparing the Phase 1 results for publication and refining the Phase 2 protocol to reflect emerging strategic opportunities.\nFor the remainder of the current year, our priorities include completing the Phase 1 data analysis, scheduling the End-of-Phase-1 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), integrating their feedback into our development strategy, and evaluating Phase 2 funding pathways, including the option to independently finance.\nWhilst the Expanded Access Program (EAP) continues to attract interest from patients who have exhausted standard treatment options, participation remains limited due to prolonged site activation timelines. While some individuals can access treatment by journeying to active sites, many cannot. We remain deeply committed to expanding access to GaM and are actively exploring solutions to overcome these barriers and serve patients in need.\nThe completion of Phase 1 marks a milestone in the development of GaM. The trial met its primary endpoints, with early data suggesting a potentially superior therapeutic profile relative to current standard-of-care. As we transition toward Phase 2, our focus is on generating statistically robust efficacy data to support regulatory approval. Upon availability of these data, we will re-engage with the FDA to resubmit our Breakthrough Therapy designation request, incorporating the agency's feedback from our initial submission to strengthen the case for accelerated review.\nWe're tracking our FDA-granted Rare Paediatric Disease Designations for two urgent indications-paediatric-type diffuse high-grade glioma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour, which position IB-003 to earn a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) upon approval. These PRVs have historically commanded very substantial valuations, offering both strategic and financial upside. Congress is actively considering an extension of the PRV program via the Give Kids a Chance Act, which passed the House unanimously; a Senate companion bill is pending. While final passage isn't guaranteed, strong bipartisan and advocacy support point to a promising outcome.\nIB Clinic\nDespite the clinical value and technical maturity of IB Clinic, adoption through third-party AI marketplace platforms has been underwhelming. These channels, while promising in theory, have proven fragmented, slow-moving, and misaligned with the urgency and precision required in neuro-oncology imaging. The lack of meaningful traction reflects broader challenges: limited platform engagement, complex integration pathways, and insufficient prioritization of disease-specific tools. While disappointing, this experience underscores the need for more direct, strategic deployment models that prioritize clinical impact over varied menu applications.\nGoing forward, we will shift our focus toward direct engagement with the clinicians and decision-makers who stand to benefit most from IB Clinic's capabilities. Our outreach will intensify across oncology, neurosurgery, radiology-and even patient advocacy communities-to ensure that the value of our solutions is clearly understood and accessible. Building on the momentum of groundbreaking neurosurgical applications, including the Outstanding Project Award at ASNR 2025, we are committed to delivering targeted, high-impact messaging that highlights IB Clinic's clinical utility, ease of integration, and transformative potential in neuro-oncology care.\nWe will continue to collaborate with our channel partners-particularly as our automated fractional tumour burden (FTB) mapping technology nears release-recognizing ",

The trial remains active for currently enrolled participants, with no additional patients being recruited at this time.\nThis milestone reflects\nstrong early engagement and\nsufficient enrollment to meet the trial's statistical and operational objectives.\nWhile\nfinal internal\napprovals\nfrom the Medical College of Wisconsin\nCancer Center are pending\n, the soft close enables the\ntrial team\nto transition toward data consolidation, endpoint analysis, and\nPhase 2 protocol finalization\n- key steps in advancing\nthe development of oral\nGaM\n.\nOral GaM offers a differentiated therapeutic profile: once-daily, at-home dosing, a favorable safety record, and a novel mechanism of action that disrupts iron metabolism in tumor cells. With\nexcellent tolerability,\nGaM is positioned as a potentially transformative agent in glioblastoma care.\nIB is actively evaluating\nthe feasibility of independently financing the phase 2 trial while concurrently exploring\nstrategic partnerships\n.\nThe Company\nwill\nprovide further updates\nas the trial progresses toward formal closure and data dissemination.\nThe Board thanks its investigators,\nits\ncollaborators at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and the patients who continue to drive this research forward.\n--ENDS-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nI\nmaging Biometrics\nLtd\nTrevor Brown/Dr Al Musella/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\n(Financial Adviser and Broker)\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nAbout Imaging Biometrics\u00ae LLC\n:\nIB is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imaging Biometrics Limited, (LON: IBAI), and focuses on delivering quantitative imaging platforms and therapeutics that transform how clinicians diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and effectively.

So referring back to your IBAI/IB blurred lines Am I correct in stating MS is the CEO of IB and gets paid by IB accordingly? TEB is the CEO of the holding company IBAI, so where does his salary come from? Does it come from the revenue of IB ( as Kirkstall doesn\u2019t appear to generate revenue) or elsewhere? If so where? If this is the case why are we paying two CEO salaries from IB\u2019s revenue? Please feel free to correct me if my assumptions are wrong you are far more au fait with these matters than I am. I know TEB attended I believe 12 meetings in 2024 but he appears to have withdrawn his pledge of continued financing of IBAI if we are no longer sponsoring the trial and MS oversees IB so what does  TEB do for his salary. I assume he can\u2019t be getting paid for talking to the CEO of true as that would be silly or talking to the CEO of IB who makes the decisions about IB. I am not being facetious I genuinely would like to know who pays TEB\u2019s IBAI\u2019s CEO salary. Thank you in advance. T",

Discussions take place with major shareholders with the Company\u2019s delegating authority to the Chairman and Chief Executive to present the strategy and financial results of the Group.\u201d It says major shareholders, plural. So according to to the IBAI website the second largest shareholder is Kathleen Schmainda*\t10,502,081\t4.26% So do we as a group control over 10.5m shares? If so we would be the second largest shareholder and as stated the CEO and Chairman should present the strategy to us. BB I know you had an email communicating with shareholders in the past. Would it be possible to resurrect that please and post details here? I know people may not like posting on here and may prefer to be hidden so may prefer email communication but if we knew we had more than 10.5m it would be helpful. I will start by declaring I oversee 3.1m shares Do we hold more shares than KS? Thanks T",

Obviously if we don\u2019t get the backing of enough shares I apologise for wasting everyone\u2019s time reading my posts and would not send the emails to the board members. Dear Mr Brown and board members of IBAI Ltd. As stated in your most recent annual accounts: \u201cDialogue with major shareholders The Company places considerable importance on communications with shareholders. Discussions take place with major shareholders with the Company\u2019s delegating authority to the Chairman and Chief Executive to present the strategy and financial results of the Group.\u201d So we as a group (members of the LSE IBAI bulletin board) hold over (tbc) millions shares in the company and would like to be treated as a major shareholder in a similar fashion to Truetide. I know Mr Brown reads these posts as he is obliged to by the FCA. So to confirm the questions I asked/posted yesterday: \u201cDear Board of Directors If you have a grand plan in the future of IBAI then could you please share it with us, the shareholders by the close of trading Tuesday 20th January 2026. We believe we need and have a right to know if our investment actually has a future. Primarily can we be informed of any increases in revenue expected or actual in IB products and what are the plans for the GAM trial data, are the company in discussions for either licensing or sale of said data? Thank you\u201d I will also send a copy of this (and a link to this board https://www.lse.co.uk/ShareChat.html?ShareTicker=IBAI&share=Imaging-Bio to MS, BS, GBAC so they are aware of the situation. Thank you everyone, please let\u2019s keep the momentum going. If you post on say ADVN please consider asking them if they would like to be involved as well. T",

Telegram uses usernames, making it easier for people to participate without sharing personal details. Telegram also provides stronger moderation tools (private invite links, admin controls, easy removal of troublesome posters.) For PI groups discussing public information only, Telegram is generally safer, more private, and easier to manage than WhatsApp. If someone knows how to do this please count me in. Thanks",

I have emailed the board about what we have been discussing and this is the response from Mr Brown \u201cIt is not appropriate for the board to engage directly with social media, our responsibility is to monitor posts for evidence of leaks of confidential or seriously mis-leading assertions. We take seriously our responsibilities to ensure shareholders are kept up to date via the regular publication of RNS reports and the Interim and Annual reports, this policy ensues that all shareholders are treated equally as far as information\u00a0is concerned\u201d My subsequent reply \u201cI totally agree with all shareholders being treated equally. With regards kept up to date that\u2019s where our thoughts differ. So if all shareholders are being treated equally could you possibly issue a clear RNS or similar outlining the company\u2019s responses to various concerns that have being raised in a similar manner to what was done previously with shareholder updates. I assume that would be easier than the group going through the process of asking for a meeting. People are only asking to be kept up to date with what is happening with their company.\u201d As of yet I have not had a reply from Mr Brown or any other board members. So to summarise the board believes that shareholders are kept up to date. I beg to differ and will the board do as they stated in the annual report talk to major shareholders if we as a group show we are the second largest shareholders? Do we need to go through the process of asking Apex for a general meeting? Thanks T",

          "content": "As I thought yesterday I got this from Google (not sure if AI generated, I am guessing it is) Yes, a group of shareholders can absolutely request a general meeting, typically requiring at least 5% of voting rights (or sometimes fewer members if they hold significant capital) under the UK's Companies Act 2006; they can requisition the directors to call one, and if directors fail to act, the shareholders themselves can call the meeting and recover reasonable expenses from the company. How it Works (UK Companies Act 2006): Threshold: Shareholders holding at least 5% of the company's paid-up share capital with voting rights can require directors to call a general meeting (Section 303). The Requisition: It must be in writing and deposited at the company's registered office. It must state the \"objects\" (purpose) of the meeting, meaning the resolutions they want to propose (e.g., removing directors, specific actions). Director's Duty: Directors must call the meeting within 21 days of receiving the requisition, and the meeting must be held within 28 days of the notice being sent out. Shareholder Action (If Directors Fail): If directors don't comply, the shareholders who made the request (or those representing over half the voting rights of all requisitionists) can call the meeting themselves. Expenses: The company must reimburse the shareholders for their reasonable expenses in holding the meeting, and these costs can be deducted from directors' pay if they were in default, notes CMS LAW-NOW. So the company registrars are Apex in Jersey, and have the same address as our registered office I believe. Confusingly our website says it is the address of Imaging Biometrics not IBAI. Do we hold more than 5%? So far I know of 8m shares we need 12.5m. Not sure how many people have emailed in their amounts. For the record I have been told Brett is out of the office until Thursday Thanks",

I am not sure about how many people have said how many shares they own via email to BB but we have over the 3% to be classed as a group as a significant shareholder. Do we have enough to be over 5% to call for a general, I don\u2019t know? For both personal reasons, that some on the board are aware of, and me believing we need somebody with a far better understanding of how businesses work and the regulations I will stop posting incessantly and hope others take up the mantle to hold the board accountable whilst I take more of a back seat. I have tried to collate all the questions I could think of and the contacts for all the people I could think of. Will these people respond, my honest feeling is I don\u2019t know but if anything does happen in the future the more people we can say who asked questions the better. Yrek said he complained to the FCA previously so tha will be logged.  The company secretary Apex should have but they haven\u2019t replied to me yet. That\u2019s why we need somebody far better acquainted with these rules and regulations to take this further. I invested in IBAI so shows how much I know!

I knew the risks and possible pitfalls with regard to the current ownership and invested because I believed that the imaging technology could one day be ground breaking. Virtually all boards of directors care about shareholders in the same way a race horse owner thinks of punters betting on his horse in the 3.15 at Ascot. TB funded this company at the outset and wants his pound of flesh if it comes good. I am sitting on my hands until the CLN/placing and I will then add accordingly. Good luck to everybody and if this share is causing you too mush grief and anger as seems to be the case with some holders (not you Tyke you are being proactive) perhaps better to take the hit and move on.",

So the bit that people want to hear The company has being trying to engage with partners for a phase 2 partner. One of the technical issues has been the trial was being extended and one patient is still enrolled. I think that is great news for the patient. We do own the data but MCW will publish the results. These results haven\u2019t been completed yet, patient still alive. Possible partners obviously want the phase 1 results which have not been fully written up yet and Mr Brown couldn\u2019t give a definitive date for when they would be. It is MCW not IB that is publishing the data. The cost of the trial was hoped to be $2.5m with a start date of approximately in a year\u2019s time and taking about 3 years to complete. Which the company did  also look at self funding. The company has been talking to an institution/hospital about partnering with the trial. However, the other people never actually committed and a decision kept being delayed. What I hadn\u2019t realised is how the clinical trial process is quite competitive with oncologist\u2019s deciding who to refer their patient for a trial. As GBM is quite a niche disease (thankfully) and there being other trials available it is quite competitive. So last week at a board meeting and the non decision from the prospective partner a decision was taken to concentrate on the core business as this has been suffering due to the GBM trial. (We have commented previously how MS is trying to do too much) So my understanding is due to the lack of commitment from a prospective partner, the results still not being published, the competitiveness of clinical trials, oncologists choice, time the trial would take to complete we have stopped it to concentrate on the core IB business. (As stated in the RNS this could change I assume, let\u2019s see how much interest the results generate I would guess) We do own the data. After hearing this I personally agree with that decision. Truetide - discussed briefly and TB believes this is a wise future investment for the company. The board are hoping to share a comprehensive strategy update soon, hopefully February. Mr Brown has subsequently messaged  (after the meeting) to say the EAP is ongoing for now. Did I believe Mr Brown, the simple answer is yes I do. Do I now think the right decision was made re the trial, yes I do. Do I now wish we had been given more information in the last update, yes but they were rushing after the board meeting to update us with regards their decision. Will I keep investing in IBAI, yes Have I bought the Porsche yet, no I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brown for giving me the chance to talk to him. I hope I have given an accurate account of our conversation. Apologies if I have got any details wrong. I hope members of this board find this new information helpful. Personall",

I suspect those who have had enough have already sold up by now. Is the company only worth just over \u00a31m? Absolutely not. Look at how it was valued before we got engrossed by the GAM trial. Several people have always said the imaging side was the money generator. I didn\u2019t believe them and hoped it was the trial (it may still be). I was wrong. I think we will just keep getting small fluctuations in the sp and people quietly building a position whilst we await the shareholder update, trial results, annual report and anything else we don\u2019t know about. For those posters who have left, goodbye and thank you. For those new to the board or are still hanging in there let\u2019s see what we hear in the next 3 months or so. And good luck.

In 5 years and millions of pounds raised nothing has come to fruition. The exact opposite has happened multiple times with various company products that at the beginning of their life were the next best thing or cutting edge technology set to solve mankind\u2019s problems. To then just be shelved and never mentioned again by the bod. All of the bod are complicit in this fraud hence the reason AM decided to leave. If the bod cared they would have at least provided a plan moving forward in how they expect to create value for all shareholders but they haven\u2019t. If anyone believes a word that Trevor Edward Brown prints in an rns in the future I will personally offer to pay for them to see a Dr as they can\u2019t be mentally well. The problem with the uk regulator is they don\u2019t care about the small pi hence the reason people like Trevor are able to act as they do. It really is a joke.",

As Chairman of the company, you have a responsibility to shareholders. I have been \"with\" the company since the days of Flying Flowers. Two years ago, I emailed Trevor Brown - worried about the direction the company was heading - and he said that I should \"judge me in two years\". Well, the SP has dived from 5pps to 0.5 pps - which is quite damning. And I note that the CEO takes a salary of \u00a3100k per year. This year, that will be 10% of the company's MCAP. The latest RNS flies in the face of all the previous ones about the future of IBAI - and indeed the CEO seems to have protected himself & family by selling shares to another of his companies. IBAI is now almost a shell company. What steps are you taking to protect shareholders? With thanks, as always, -- BB --",

In my opinion this announcement should have been made at least last august (when the paper for Gabriel trial was written) as they must have known then Ibai or Iqai were not going to be involved. The more you look into this the worse it looks. Really they need to issue a shareholder letter asap announcing who what why and when rather than this Trevor brown special that just creates more questions than answers.",

I believe it is up to all shareholders to be proactive and fight back. We can\u2019t keep complaining on here if we do nothing about it. So I would suggest if we have had no further detailed communication from the board by Tuesday, close of trading, then I think we need to start being proactive and start asking questions. We are shareholders and deserve to know what\u2019s happening. So the questions I think we should focus on are relevant to the future of the company and our investment Dear As a concerned shareholder I  would like the answers to these questions please: What has changed since the RNS issued on 10th November 2025 which states \u201cWith Phase 1 now complete, IB is actively engaging with leading cancer centers to initiate a Phase 2 trial aimed at further evaluating GaM's efficacy and expanding its clinical footprint.\u201d? Also, the same MCW clinical staff stated for the Gabriel trial \u201cIn our ongoing Phase 1 trial of oral GaM for adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma, GaM has been well-tolerated without significant side effects. Thus, we hypothesize GaM can be safely administered enterally to pediatric patients.\u201d Does that mean if GaM is approved by the FDA for paediatric use that IBAI are the ones who would own the paediatric rare drug designation? Why did we buy Kirkstall from Truetide and what was Trevor Brown\u2019s actual involvement in the deal? Who initiated the purchase Truetide or IBAI if we are now solely focussed on imaging as Kirkstall doesn\u2019t fit in with that? Basically what reassurances have shareholders got for the long term future for the company and our investments? How do know that the long term plan is not for the Kirkstall, or any subsequent deal, to lead to bankruptcy IBAI and the imaging and IP then belongs to truetide?

IB did not \u201cbuy Kirkstall from Truetide\u201d, but IBAI limited did. This is an important distinction as some here are implying that it was a kind of involuntary acquisition by the wholly owned subsidiary IB and even that it is part of a plot for Truetide to get hold of the IB IP. Remember also that the board of IBAI Limited comprises one independent NXD as well as MS the CEO of IB, plus TEB, and that it is the board of IBAI limited that makes decisions on group operations. Generally everything I comment about here is derived from existing public records but sometimes I seem to be the only one here who bothers to read in detail about our company.",

TB didn\u2019t seem to rate another FT columnist \u201cLex\u201d when he was writing his blog about being in Heidiland https://fabooks.wordpress.com/category/lex-watch-bun-rating/ Semantic you haven\u2019t commented on yesterday\u2019s RNS maybe you may wish to publish your thoughts on why the sudden change from the November RNS and IB not being involved in the Gabriel trial. Even though they refer to our current phase 1 clinical trial in their journal post. Indeed what happened to the discussions with prospective partners? Why have we shareholders not been informed on what with those. Funny how somethings are deemed important enough to report in an RNS but then the changes aren\u2019t. I think in summary in RNS\u2019s we have been lead to believe the trial was to be continued with or without partners. Why the sudden change, if we are now solely focussed on imagery etc why did the board purchase Kirkstall? Thank you",

If further clinical trials of gallium maltolate in adults \" is no longer in shareholders' interests\", then doesn't that beg the question that the same trial in Pediatric Patients would also likely fail?  Or if it hasn't failed, why are we not involved in the latter and giving up on the former?  As previously mentioned, we need more info. 2. A question I ask myself is the \u00a3170,000 question of why is Kirkstall only worth this, if it's in the top 10 of the \"organ on a chip\" market, and my only answer is that it's a new industry and has only been sold by scientists to academics in the UK.  Can IBAI widen it's market?",

What is the investor relation email address on the IBAI website? I will help you it is investor@imagingbiometrics.com That\u2019s an IB address not IBAI. Indeed can we trust the IBAI website as it still says AM is a director. Which nicely brings me in to another blurred item. The Gabriel trial journal entry clearly states our phase 1 clinical trial. I assume our means IB or IBAI which KS is a significant shareholder in. KS is noted as being a participant in the drug trial. So they are using our data but we are not the sponsors. Have they licensed our data or has it just been given to them or indeed used without permission by a significant shareholder? If the Gabriel trial suddenly got a new sponsor would they own our data? This has not been explained clearly by the RNS which seemed very rushed. So semantic, in short we know the difference between IB and IBAI but does the company or its board or its significant shareholders? Thank you",

So referring back to your IBAI/IB blurred lines Am I correct in stating MS is the CEO of IB and gets paid by IB accordingly? TEB is the CEO of the holding company IBAI, so where does his salary come from? Does it come from the revenue of IB ( as Kirkstall doesn\u2019t appear to generate revenue) or elsewhere? If so where? If this is the case why are we paying two CEO salaries from IB\u2019s revenue? Please feel free to correct me if my assumptions are wrong you are far more au fait with these matters than I am. I know TEB attended I believe 12 meetings in 2024 but he appears to have withdrawn his pledge of continued financing of IBAI if we are no longer sponsoring the trial and MS oversees IB so what does  TEB do for his salary. I assume he can\u2019t be getting paid for talking to the CEO of true as that would be silly or talking to the CEO of IB who makes the decisions about IB. I am not being facetious I genuinely would like to know who pays TEB\u2019s IBAI\u2019s CEO salary. Thank you in advance. T",

Anyway if Semantic and the board refuse to answer questions maybe there is another way.

Discussions take place with major shareholders with the Company\u2019s delegating authority to the Chairman and Chief Executive to present the strategy and financial results of the Group.\u201d It says major shareholders, plural. So according to to the IBAI website the second largest shareholder is Kathleen Schmainda*\t10,502,081\t4.26% So do we as a group control over 10.5m shares? If so we would be the second largest shareholder and as stated the CEO and Chairman should present the strategy to us. BB I know you had an email communicating with shareholders in the past. Would it be possible to resurrect that please and post details here? I know people may not like posting on here and may prefer to be hidden so may prefer email communication but if we knew we had more than 10.5m it would be helpful. I will start by declaring I oversee 3.1m shares Do we hold more shares than KS? Thanks T",

Obviously if we don\u2019t get the backing of enough shares I apologise for wasting everyone\u2019s time reading my posts and would not send the emails to the board members. Dear Mr Brown and board members of IBAI Ltd. As stated in your most recent annual accounts: \u201cDialogue with major shareholders The Company places considerable importance on communications with shareholders. Discussions take place with major shareholders with the Company\u2019s delegating authority to the Chairman and Chief Executive to present the strategy and financial results of the Group.\u201d So we as a group (members of the LSE IBAI bulletin board) hold over (tbc) millions shares in the company and would like to be treated as a major shareholder in a similar fashion to Truetide. I know Mr Brown reads these posts as he is obliged to by the FCA. So to confirm the questions I asked/posted yesterday: \u201cDear Board of Directors If you have a grand plan in the future of IBAI then could you please share it with us, the shareholders by the close of trading Tuesday 20th January 2026. We believe we need and have a right to know if our investment actually has a future. Primarily can we be informed of any increases in revenue expected or actual in IB products and what are the plans for the GAM trial data, are the company in discussions for either licensing or sale of said data? Thank you\u201d I will also send a copy of this (and a link to this board https://www.lse.co.uk/ShareChat.html?ShareTicker=IBAI&share=Imaging-Bio to MS, BS, GBAC so they are aware of the situation. Thank you everyone, please let\u2019s keep the momentum going. If you post on say ADVN please consider asking them if they would like to be involved as well. T",

Telegram also provides stronger moderation tools (private invite links, admin controls, easy removal of troublesome posters.) For PI groups discussing public information only, Telegram is generally safer, more private, and easier to manage than WhatsApp. If someone knows how to do this please count me in. Thanks",

I have emailed the board about what we have been discussing and this is the response from Mr Brown \u201cIt is not appropriate for the board to engage directly with social media, our responsibility is to monitor posts for evidence of leaks of confidential or seriously mis-leading assertions. We take seriously our responsibilities to ensure shareholders are kept up to date via the regular publication of RNS reports and the Interim and Annual reports, this policy ensues that all shareholders are treated equally as far as information\u00a0is concerned\u201d My subsequent reply \u201cI totally agree with all shareholders being treated equally. With regards kept up to date that\u2019s where our thoughts differ. So if all shareholders are being treated equally could you possibly issue a clear RNS or similar outlining the company\u2019s responses to various concerns that have being raised in a similar manner to what was done previously with shareholder updates. I assume that would be easier than the group going through the process of asking for a meeting. People are only asking to be kept up to date with what is happening with their company.\u201d As of yet I have not had a reply from Mr Brown or any other board members. So to summarise the board believes that shareholders are kept up to date. I beg to differ and will the board do as they stated in the annual report talk to major shareholders if we as a group show we are the second largest shareholders? Do we need to go through the process of asking Apex for a general meeting? Thanks T",

          "content": "As I thought yesterday I got this from Google (not sure if AI generated, I am guessing it is) Yes, a group of shareholders can absolutely request a general meeting, typically requiring at least 5% of voting rights (or sometimes fewer members if they hold significant capital) under the UK's Companies Act 2006; they can requisition the directors to call one, and if directors fail to act, the shareholders themselves can call the meeting and recover reasonable expenses from the company. How it Works (UK Companies Act 2006): Threshold: Shareholders holding at least 5% of the company's paid-up share capital with voting rights can require directors to call a general meeting (Section 303). The Requisition: It must be in writing and deposited at the company's registered office. It must state the \"objects\" (purpose) of the meeting, meaning the resolutions they want to propose (e.g., removing directors, specific actions). Director's Duty: Directors must call the meeting within 21 days of receiving the requisition, and the meeting must be held within 28 days of the notice being sent out. Shareholder Action (If Directors Fail): If directors don't comply, the shareholders who made the request (or those representing over half the voting rights of all requisitionists) can call the meeting themselves. Expenses: The company must reimburse the shareholders for their reasonable expenses in holding the meeting, and these costs can be deducted from directors' pay if they were in default, notes CMS LAW-NOW. So the company registrars are Apex in Jersey, and have the same address as our registered office I believe. Confusingly our website says it is the address of Imaging Biometrics not IBAI. Do we hold more than 5%? So far I know of 8m shares we need 12.5m. Not sure how many people have emailed in their amounts. For the record I have been told Brett is out of the office until Thursday Thanks",

I am not sure about how many people have said how many shares they own via email to BB but we have over the 3% to be classed as a group as a significant shareholder. Do we have enough to be over 5% to call for a general, I don\u2019t know? For both personal reasons, that some on the board are aware of, and me believing we need somebody with a far better understanding of how businesses work and the regulations I will stop posting incessantly and hope others take up the mantle to hold the board accountable whilst I take more of a back seat. I have tried to collate all the questions I could think of and the contacts for all the people I could think of. Will these people respond, my honest feeling is I don\u2019t know but if anything does happen in the future the more people we can say who asked questions the better. Yrek said he complained to the FCA previously so tha will be logged.  The company secretary Apex should have but they haven\u2019t replied to me yet. That\u2019s why we need somebody far better acquainted with these rules and regulations to take this further. I invested in IBAI so shows how much I know!

I knew the risks and possible pitfalls with regard to the current ownership and invested because I believed that the imaging technology could one day be ground breaking. Virtually all boards of directors care about shareholders in the same way a race horse owner thinks of punters betting on his horse in the 3.15 at Ascot. TB funded this company at the outset and wants his pound of flesh if it comes good. I am sitting on my hands until the CLN/placing and I will then add accordingly. Good luck to everybody and if this share is causing you too mush grief and anger as seems to be the case with some holders (not you Tyke you are being proactive) perhaps better to take the hit and move on.",

So the bit that people want to hear The company has being trying to engage with partners for a phase 2 partner. One of the technical issues has been the trial was being extended and one patient is still enrolled. I think that is great news for the patient. We do own the data but MCW will publish the results. These results haven\u2019t been completed yet, patient still alive. Possible partners obviously want the phase 1 results which have not been fully written up yet and Mr Brown couldn\u2019t give a definitive date for when they would be. It is MCW not IB that is publishing the data. The cost of the trial was hoped to be $2.5m with a start date of approximately in a year\u2019s time and taking about 3 years to complete. Which the company did  also look at self funding. The company has been talking to an institution/hospital about partnering with the trial. However, the other people never actually committed and a decision kept being delayed. What I hadn\u2019t realised is how the clinical trial process is quite competitive with oncologist\u2019s deciding who to refer their patient for a trial. As GBM is quite a niche disease (thankfully) and there being other trials available it is quite competitive. So last week at a board meeting and the non decision from the prospective partner a decision was taken to concentrate on the core business as this has been suffering due to the GBM trial. (We have commented previously how MS is trying to do too much) So my understanding is due to the lack of commitment from a prospective partner, the results still not being published, the competitiveness of clinical trials, oncologists choice, time the trial would take to complete we have stopped it to concentrate on the core IB business. (As stated in the RNS this could change I assume, let\u2019s see how much interest the results generate I would guess) We do own the data. After hearing this I personally agree with that decision. Truetide - discussed briefly and TB believes this is a wise future investment for the company. The board are hoping to share a comprehensive strategy update soon, hopefully February. Mr Brown has subsequently messaged  (after the meeting) to say the EAP is ongoing for now. Did I believe Mr Brown, the simple answer is yes I do. Do I now think the right decision was made re the trial, yes I do. Do I now wish we had been given more information in the last update, yes but they were rushing after the board meeting to update us with regards their decision. Will I keep investing in IBAI, yes Have I bought the Porsche yet, no I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brown for giving me the chance to talk to him. I hope I have given an accurate account of our conversation. Apologies if I have got any details wrong. I hope members of this board find this new information helpful. Personall",

The exact opposite has happened multiple times with various company products that at the beginning of their life were the next best thing or cutting edge technology set to solve mankind\u2019s problems. To then just be shelved and never mentioned again by the bod. All of the bod are complicit in this fraud hence the reason AM decided to leave.

As Chairman of the company, you have a responsibility to shareholders. I have been \"with\" the company since the days of Flying Flowers. Two years ago, I emailed Trevor Brown - worried about the direction the company was heading - and he said that I should \"judge me in two years\". Well, the SP has dived from 5pps to 0.5 pps - which is quite damning. And I note that the CEO takes a salary of \u00a3100k per year. This year, that will be 10% of the company's MCAP. The latest RNS flies in the face of all the previous ones about the future of IBAI - and indeed the CEO seems to have protected himself & family by selling shares to another of his companies. IBAI is now almost a shell company. What steps are you taking to protect shareholders? With thanks, as always, -- BB --",

It\u2019s seems as though they are just picking and choosing what rules to follow as and when it pleases them. Probably following on from Trevor\u2019s lead. In my opinion this announcement should have been made at least last august (when the paper for Gabriel trial was written) as they must have known then Ibai or Iqai were not going to be involved. The more you look into this the worse it looks. Really they need to issue a shareholder letter asap announcing who what why and when rather than this Trevor brown special that just creates more questions than answers.",

I believe it is up to all shareholders to be proactive and fight back. We can\u2019t keep complaining on here if we do nothing about it. So I would suggest if we have had no further detailed communication from the board by Tuesday, close of trading, then I think we need to start being proactive and start asking questions. We are shareholders and deserve to know what\u2019s happening. So the questions I think we should focus on are relevant to the future of the company and our investment Dear As a concerned shareholder I  would like the answers to these questions please: What has changed since the RNS issued on 10th November 2025 which states \u201cWith Phase 1 now complete, IB is actively engaging with leading cancer centers to initiate a Phase 2 trial aimed at further evaluating GaM's efficacy and expanding its clinical footprint.\u201d? Also, the same MCW clinical staff stated for the Gabriel trial \u201cIn our ongoing Phase 1 trial of oral GaM for adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma, GaM has been well-tolerated without significant side effects. Thus, we hypothesize GaM can be safely administered enterally to pediatric patients.\u201d Does that mean if GaM is approved by the FDA for paediatric use that IBAI are the ones who would own the paediatric rare drug designation? Why did we buy Kirkstall from Truetide and what was Trevor Brown\u2019s actual involvement in the deal? Who initiated the purchase Truetide or IBAI if we are now solely focussed on imaging as Kirkstall doesn\u2019t fit in with that? Basically what reassurances have shareholders got for the long term future for the company and our investments? How do know that the long term plan is not for the Kirkstall, or any subsequent deal, to lead to bankruptcy IBAI and the imaging and IP then belongs to truetide? I would like detailed answers to these questions please as I am a shareholder in this company and would like to know what is happening to my investments and how you intend to fulfil your fiduciary responsibilities to all shareholders. Yours truly We all need to ask as many people as possible, individually for their response. We need our concerns on record. We need to be united and act as a group.

IB did not \u201cbuy Kirkstall from Truetide\u201d, but IBAI limited did. This is an important distinction as some here are implying that it was a kind of involuntary acquisition by the wholly owned subsidiary IB and even that it is part of a plot for Truetide to get hold of the IB IP. Remember also that the board of IBAI Limited comprises one independent NXD as well as MS the CEO of IB, plus TEB, and that it is the board of IBAI limited that makes decisions on group operations. Generally everything I comment about here is derived from existing public records but sometimes I seem to be the only one here who bothers to read in detail about our company.",

Even though they refer to our current phase 1 clinical trial in their journal post. Indeed what happened to the discussions with prospective partners? Why have we shareholders not been informed on what with those. Funny how somethings are deemed important enough to report in an RNS but then the changes aren\u2019t. I think in summary in RNS\u2019s we have been lead to believe the trial was to be continued with or without partners. Why the sudden change, if we are now solely focussed on imagery etc why did the board purchase Kirkstall? Thank you",

A question I ask myself is the \u00a3170,000 question of why is Kirkstall only worth this, if it's in the top 10 of the \"organ on a chip\" market, and my only answer is that it's a new industry and has only been sold by scientists to academics in the UK.  Can IBAI widen it's market?",

What is the investor relation email address on the IBAI website? I will help you it is investor@imagingbiometrics.com That\u2019s an IB address not IBAI. Indeed can we trust the IBAI website as it still says AM is a director. Which nicely brings me in to another blurred item. The Gabriel trial journal entry clearly states our phase 1 clinical trial. I assume our means IB or IBAI which KS is a significant shareholder in. KS is noted as being a participant in the drug trial. So they are using our data but we are not the sponsors. Have they licensed our data or has it just been given to them or indeed used without permission by a significant shareholder? If the Gabriel trial suddenly got a new sponsor would they own our data? This has not been explained clearly by the RNS which seemed very rushed. So semantic, in short we know the difference between IB and IBAI but does the company or its board or its significant shareholders? Thank you",

TEB is the CEO of the holding company IBAI, so where does his salary come from? Does it come from the revenue of IB ( as Kirkstall doesn\u2019t appear to generate revenue) or elsewhere? If so where? If this is the case why are we paying two CEO salaries from IB\u2019s revenue? Please feel free to correct me if my assumptions are wrong you are far more au fait with these matters than I am. I know TEB attended I believe 12 meetings in 2024 but he appears to have withdrawn his pledge of continued financing of IBAI if we are no longer sponsoring the trial and MS oversees IB so what does  TEB do for his salary. I assume he can\u2019t be getting paid for talking to the CEO of true as that would be silly or talking to the CEO of IB who makes the decisions about IB. I am not being facetious I genuinely would like to know who pays TEB\u2019s IBAI\u2019s CEO salary. Thank you in advance. T",

From the last annual report: \u201cDialogue with major shareholders The Company places considerable importance on communications with shareholders. Discussions take place with major shareholders with the Company\u2019s delegating authority to the Chairman and Chief Executive to present the strategy and financial results of the Group.\u201d It says major shareholders, plural. So according to to the IBAI website the second largest shareholder is Kathleen Schmainda*\t10,502,081\t4.26% So do we as a group control over 10.5m shares? If so we would be the second largest shareholder and as stated the CEO and Chairman should present the strategy to us. BB I know you had an email communicating with shareholders in the past. Would it be possible to resurrect that please and post details here? I know people may not like posting on here and may prefer to be hidden so may prefer email communication but if we knew we had more than 10.5m it would be helpful. I will start by declaring I oversee 3.1m shares Do we hold more shares than KS? Thanks T",

Obviously if we don\u2019t get the backing of enough shares I apologise for wasting everyone\u2019s time reading my posts and would not send the emails to the board members. Dear Mr Brown and board members of IBAI Ltd. As stated in your most recent annual accounts: \u201cDialogue with major shareholders The Company places considerable importance on communications with shareholders. Discussions take place with major shareholders with the Company\u2019s delegating authority to the Chairman and Chief Executive to present the strategy and financial results of the Group.\u201d So we as a group (members of the LSE IBAI bulletin board) hold over (tbc) millions shares in the company and would like to be treated as a major shareholder in a similar fashion to Truetide. I know Mr Brown reads these posts as he is obliged to by the FCA. So to confirm the questions I asked/posted yesterday: \u201cDear Board of Directors If you have a grand plan in the future of IBAI then could you please share it with us, the shareholders by the close of trading Tuesday 20th January 2026. We believe we need and have a right to know if our investment actually has a future. Primarily can we be informed of any increases in revenue expected or actual in IB products and what are the plans for the GAM trial data, are the company in discussions for either licensing or sale of said data? Thank you\u201d I will also send a copy of this (and a link to this board https://www.lse.co.uk/ShareChat.html?ShareTicker=IBAI&share=Imaging-Bio to MS, BS, GBAC so they are aware of the situation. Thank you everyone, please let\u2019s keep the momentum going. If you post on say ADVN please consider asking them if they would like to be involved as well. T",

Other shareholder please feel free to join and see if we can overtake KS. Mr Brown and board members I think this shows you that we would like to be treated with more respect and shown the courtesy to have the strategy outlined to us as per the most recent annual accounts. We are not the enemy but wish to be treated as valued long term shareholders. Thank you to everybody for the time they have spent on this board since Friday. I hope it is worthwhile. As I replied to Hattie, I just want answers to our questions and don\u2019t want to jeopardise any ongoing talks that might be happening that could create increase value for shareholders. Let\u2019s see what next week brings. Semantic I hope reaching this figure as a group adds some gravitas to my question I asked earlier. Thank you T",

I have emailed the board about what we have been discussing and this is the response from Mr Brown \u201cIt is not appropriate for the board to engage directly with social media, our responsibility is to monitor posts for evidence of leaks of confidential or seriously mis-leading assertions. We take seriously our responsibilities to ensure shareholders are kept up to date via the regular publication of RNS reports and the Interim and Annual reports, this policy ensues that all shareholders are treated equally as far as information\u00a0is concerned\u201d My subsequent reply \u201cI totally agree with all shareholders being treated equally. With regards kept up to date that\u2019s where our thoughts differ. So if all shareholders are being treated equally could you possibly issue a clear RNS or similar outlining the company\u2019s responses to various concerns that have being raised in a similar manner to what was done previously with shareholder updates. I assume that would be easier than the group going through the process of asking for a meeting. People are only asking to be kept up to date with what is happening with their company.\u201d As of yet I have not had a reply from Mr Brown or any other board members. So to summarise the board believes that shareholders are kept up to date. I beg to differ and will the board do as they stated in the annual report talk to major shareholders if we as a group show we are the second largest shareholders? Do we need to go through the process of asking Apex for a general meeting? Thanks T",

          "content": "As I thought yesterday I got this from Google (not sure if AI generated, I am guessing it is) Yes, a group of shareholders can absolutely request a general meeting, typically requiring at least 5% of voting rights (or sometimes fewer members if they hold significant capital) under the UK's Companies Act 2006; they can requisition the directors to call one, and if directors fail to act, the shareholders themselves can call the meeting and recover reasonable expenses from the company. How it Works (UK Companies Act 2006): Threshold: Shareholders holding at least 5% of the company's paid-up share capital with voting rights can require directors to call a general meeting (Section 303). The Requisition: It must be in writing and deposited at the company's registered office. It must state the \"objects\" (purpose) of the meeting, meaning the resolutions they want to propose (e.g., removing directors, specific actions). Director's Duty: Directors must call the meeting within 21 days of receiving the requisition, and the meeting must be held within 28 days of the notice being sent out. Shareholder Action (If Directors Fail): If directors don't comply, the shareholders who made the request (or those representing over half the voting rights of all requisitionists) can call the meeting themselves. Expenses: The company must reimburse the shareholders for their reasonable expenses in holding the meeting, and these costs can be deducted from directors' pay if they were in default, notes CMS LAW-NOW. So the company registrars are Apex in Jersey, and have the same address as our registered office I believe. Confusingly our website says it is the address of Imaging Biometrics not IBAI. Do we hold more than 5%? So far I know of 8m shares we need 12.5m. Not sure how many people have emailed in their amounts. For the record I have been told Brett is out of the office until Thursday Thanks",

Any new investors looking in here would not invest a penny/cent with tb and his cronies still around. It would be nice if the board would release a statement or shareholder letter providing reassurance that investors that are 90% down on their investments might one day see a return. And provide some sort of plan moving forward so we at least know what we\u2019re likely to see a return in? It\u2019s not much to ask as a long term suffering shareholder is it. Rather than shout just sell up it would be nice to hear some constructive feedback because as it stands this looks like it\u2019s going out of business in roughly 6 months. It would also be nice if the bod share their reasoning on why they thought it best to secure the company\u2019s op against something they valued at. Zero just months prior?

Kane I seriously think we as shareholders have 3 options 1, think it is all a bunch of lies in which case I also would cash in 2, not want to risk any more and cut your losses and again cash in 3, currently, believe in the BoD, stay invested and see what happens over the next 3 months. Whatever we discuss on here isn\u2019t going to change what happens. We can argue, comment negatively etc about the BoD but if people feel that strongly then why stay? Investors have to make their own decisions based on their own thoughts and circumstances. I am firmly in option 3, whether I stay like that will depends on what happens in the future. The sp seems to have stabilised at this level and I can\u2019t see it varying until we get another RNS. Things that influence my option \u2022hopefully an indication of greater revenue \u2022possibly the sale of part of IB tech \u2022the phase 1 results, which are out of IB\u2019s control. \u2022GaM could still be a possibility saleable asset as Max has pointed out True and KS are suffering with their investments as well. We all hope there is a plan and as TB said we will hopefully get a comprehensive update in February. Until we have more information I can see no point in much more discussions. I hate to say it but I think it was semantic who quoted WB I believe and talked about not checking on the too often. Thanks",

Everything I have found about GaM suggests a positive result and helped to form a strong investment case, outweighing the obvious negatives that we have discussed ad infinitum. The idea of concentrating on the imaging side is something we have all heard before, I remember the \u2018step change\u2019 comment. I agree the imaging products are very good but they need to translate this into revenue and quickly, there are plenty of competitors in this space. The balance sheet is largely the result of the ill thought out decisions of two years ago, it could have been very different for everyone. I wish you all well and hope that this turns out good. Also I hope that a properly resourced and financed organisation progresses GaM as that is the real shame here. All the best, Shrek",

So the bit that people want to hear The company has being trying to engage with partners for a phase 2 partner. One of the technical issues has been the trial was being extended and one patient is still enrolled. I think that is great news for the patient. We do own the data but MCW will publish the results. These results haven\u2019t been completed yet, patient still alive. Possible partners obviously want the phase 1 results which have not been fully written up yet and Mr Brown couldn\u2019t give a definitive date for when they would be. It is MCW not IB that is publishing the data. The cost of the trial was hoped to be $2.5m with a start date of approximately in a year\u2019s time and taking about 3 years to complete. Which the company did  also look at self funding. The company has been talking to an institution/hospital about partnering with the trial. However, the other people never actually committed and a decision kept being delayed. What I hadn\u2019t realised is how the clinical trial process is quite competitive with oncologist\u2019s deciding who to refer their patient for a trial. As GBM is quite a niche disease (thankfully) and there being other trials available it is quite competitive. So last week at a board meeting and the non decision from the prospective partner a decision was taken to concentrate on the core business as this has been suffering due to the GBM trial. (We have commented previously how MS is trying to do too much) So my understanding is due to the lack of commitment from a prospective partner, the results still not being published, the competitiveness of clinical trials, oncologists choice, time the trial would take to complete we have stopped it to concentrate on the core IB business. (As stated in the RNS this could change I assume, let\u2019s see how much interest the results generate I would guess) We do own the data. After hearing this I personally agree with that decision. Truetide - discussed briefly and TB believes this is a wise future investment for the company. The board are hoping to share a comprehensive strategy update soon, hopefully February. Mr Brown has subsequently messaged  (after the meeting) to say the EAP is ongoing for now. Did I believe Mr Brown, the simple answer is yes I do. Do I now think the right decision was made re the trial, yes I do. Do I now wish we had been given more information in the last update, yes but they were rushing after the board meeting to update us with regards their decision. Will I keep investing in IBAI, yes Have I bought the Porsche yet, no I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brown for giving me the chance to talk to him. I hope I have given an accurate account of our conversation. Apologies if I have got any details wrong. I hope members of this board find this new information helpful. Personall",

TB funded this company at the outset and wants his pound of flesh if it comes good. I am sitting on my hands until the CLN/placing and I will then add accordingly.

I am not sure about how many people have said how many shares they own via email to BB but we have over the 3% to be classed as a group as a significant shareholder.

For both personal reasons, that some on the board are aware of, and me believing we need somebody with a far better understanding of how businesses work and the regulations I will stop posting incessantly and hope others take up the mantle to hold the board accountable whilst I take more of a back seat. I have tried to collate all the questions I could think of and the contacts for all the people I could think of. Will these people respond, my honest feeling is I don\u2019t know but if anything does happen in the future the more people we can say who asked questions the better. Yrek said he complained to the FCA previously so tha will be logged.  The company secretary Apex should have but they haven\u2019t replied to me yet.

That said I do think a couple  of TRUE's small investments are likely to perform better than  it's larger ones, which TB seems to have more control over.",

Several people have always said the imaging side was the money generator. I didn\u2019t believe them and hoped it was the trial (it may still be). I was wrong. I think we will just keep getting small fluctuations in the sp and people quietly building a position whilst we await the shareholder update, trial results, annual report and anything else we don\u2019t know about.

Kane I seriously think we as shareholders have 3 options 1, think it is all a bunch of lies in which case I also would cash in 2, not want to risk any more and cut your losses and again cash in 3, currently, believe in the BoD, stay invested and see what happens over the next 3 months. Whatever we discuss on here isn\u2019t going to change what happens. We can argue, comment negatively etc about the BoD but if people feel that strongly then why stay? Investors have to make their own decisions based on their own thoughts and circumstances. I am firmly in option 3, whether I stay like that will depends on what happens in the future. The sp seems to have stabilised at this level and I can\u2019t see it varying until we get another RNS. Things that influence my option \u2022hopefully an indication of greater revenue \u2022possibly the sale of part of IB tech \u2022the phase 1 results, which are out of IB\u2019s control. \u2022GaM could still be a possibility saleable asset as Max has pointed out True and KS are suffering with their investments as well. We all hope there is a plan and as TB said we will hopefully get a comprehensive update in February. Until we have more information I can see no point in much more discussions.

Everything I have found about GaM suggests a positive result and helped to form a strong investment case, outweighing the obvious negatives that we have discussed ad infinitum. The idea of concentrating on the imaging side is something we have all heard before, I remember the \u2018step change\u2019 comment. I agree the imaging products are very good but they need to translate this into revenue and quickly, there are plenty of competitors in this space. The balance sheet is largely the result of the ill thought out decisions of two years ago, it could have been very different for everyone. I wish you all well and hope that this turns out good. Also I hope that a properly resourced and financed organisation progresses GaM as that is the real shame here. All the best, Shrek",

So the bit that people want to hear The company has being trying to engage with partners for a phase 2 partner. One of the technical issues has been the trial was being extended and one patient is still enrolled. I think that is great news for the patient. We do own the data but MCW will publish the results. These results haven\u2019t been completed yet, patient still alive. Possible partners obviously want the phase 1 results which have not been fully written up yet and Mr Brown couldn\u2019t give a definitive date for when they would be. It is MCW not IB that is publishing the data. The cost of the trial was hoped to be $2.5m with a start date of approximately in a year\u2019s time and taking about 3 years to complete. Which the company did  also look at self funding. The company has been talking to an institution/hospital about partnering with the trial. However, the other people never actually committed and a decision kept being delayed. What I hadn\u2019t realised is how the clinical trial process is quite competitive with oncologist\u2019s deciding who to refer their patient for a trial. As GBM is quite a niche disease (thankfully) and there being other trials available it is quite competitive. So last week at a board meeting and the non decision from the prospective partner a decision was taken to concentrate on the core business as this has been suffering due to the GBM trial. (We have commented previously how MS is trying to do too much) So my understanding is due to the lack of commitment from a prospective partner, the results still not being published, the competitiveness of clinical trials, oncologists choice, time the trial would take to complete we have stopped it to concentrate on the core IB business. (As stated in the RNS this could change I assume, let\u2019s see how much interest the results generate I would guess) We do own the data. After hearing this I personally agree with that decision. Truetide - discussed briefly and TB believes this is a wise future investment for the company. The board are hoping to share a comprehensive strategy update soon, hopefully February. Mr Brown has subsequently messaged  (after the meeting) to say the EAP is ongoing for now. Did I believe Mr Brown, the simple answer is yes I do. Do I now think the right decision was made re the trial, yes I do. Do I now wish we had been given more information in the last update, yes but they were rushing after the board meeting to update us with regards their decision. Will I keep investing in IBAI, yes Have I bought the Porsche yet, no I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brown for giving me the chance to talk to him. I hope I have given an accurate account of our conversation. Apologies if I have got any details wrong. I hope members of this board find this new information helpful. Personall",

I knew the risks and possible pitfalls with regard to the current ownership and invested because I believed that the imaging technology could one day be ground breaking. Virtually all boards of directors care about shareholders in the same way a race horse owner thinks of punters betting on his horse in the 3.15 at Ascot. TB funded this company at the outset and wants his pound of flesh if it comes good. I am sitting on my hands until the CLN/placing and I will then add accordingly. Good luck to everybody and if this share is causing you too mush grief and anger as seems to be the case with some holders (not you Tyke you are being proactive) perhaps better to take the hit and move on.",

I am not sure about how many people have said how many shares they own via email to BB but we have over the 3% to be classed as a group as a significant shareholder. Do we have enough to be over 5% to call for a general, I don\u2019t know? For both personal reasons, that some on the board are aware of, and me believing we need somebody with a far better understanding of how businesses work and the regulations I will stop posting incessantly and hope others take up the mantle to hold the board accountable whilst I take more of a back seat. I have tried to collate all the questions I could think of and the contacts for all the people I could think of. Will these people respond, my honest feeling is I don\u2019t know but if anything does happen in the future the more people we can say who asked questions the better. Yrek said he complained to the FCA previously so tha will be logged.  The company secretary Apex should have but they haven\u2019t replied to me yet. That\u2019s why we need somebody far better acquainted with these rules and regulations to take this further. I invested in IBAI so shows how much I know!

          "content": "The last sentence! \u201cINTRODUCTION We previously reported that gallium maltolate (GaM) monotherapy has a profound cytotoxic effect on glioblastoma (GBM) cells in vitro and in vivo. Recent in vitro data suggests that GaM may act as a radiosensitizer, which could dramatically change how brain tumors are treated. These findings prompted further investigation into the potential neurotoxic effects of GaM alone and in combination with radiation therapy (RT). METHODS Athymic rats were inoculated intracranially with treatment-resistant U87MG GBM cells. After tumor confirmation on MRI, animals received oral GaM 50mg/kg/day or vehicle. A pilot cohort received RT (21 Gy) 28 days later. MRI was performed on a 9.4T Bruker preclinical scanner using our custom acquisition protocol that included pre- and post-contrast anatomical T1 and T2 sequences, and DSC perfusion imaging. Longitudinal MR spectroscopy was collected from 2mm3 voxels placed in enhancing and non-enhancing areas. MRI studies were repeated every 10-14 days. Data was processed using Imaging Biometrics and Bruker Paravision analysis software, as well as custom-made MATLAB scripts. RESULTS Brain microvascular cells were unaffected by GaM therapy in vitro and in vivo. Advanced MRI biomarkers, such as fractional tumor burden maps, highlighted the cytotoxic effect of GaM on xenograft tumors but not on surrounding brain parenchyma. The addition of a subclinical RT dose did not alter these findings. Absence of necrosis-marking vinyl and lactate peaks on MR spectra, as well as histology, confirmed the safety profile of combination GaM+RT. Additionally, MR spectra of non-tumor brain following acute (14 days of GaM) were comparable to those of chronic (47 days of GaM) treatment, indicating no metabolic changes. Finally, absence of sensorimotor deficits provided further evidence of GaM\u2019s safety. These results are being validated currently in a larger cohort of animals. CONCLUSION GaM therapy does not cause overt neurotoxicity and is associated with excellent quality of life.\u201d From https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397501606_EXTH-134_The_oral_iron_mimetic_gallium_maltolate_is_neurologically_safe_in_a_rat_xenograft_model_of_glioblastoma_multimodal_assessment But what will the phase 1 show? The possibility of vouchers may interest some if they could be done by 2029 but \u201cexcellent quality of life\u201d may create more of a buzz and maybe even a bidding war when the phase 1 results are published. Or then again it might not. Thanks",

All this was distracting from the imaging work So the decision to not start the phase 2 trial which would take approx 1 year to prepare and a further 3 years to complete was taken. If we look at from the perspective of get some sales for imaging, build some momentum as MS can concentrate on just that side. If we self funded would we have to dilute further to raise the capital (2.5m) so that raises the prospect of \u201cshenanigans\u201d again. We still own the data and all the designations so surely that is worth an amount surely? Let\u2019s see what happens when the results are finally released is it the magical cancer elixir? Hopefully this month we will get a comprehensive update and possibly phase 1 results. Maybe an update on signed new contracts. How is the revenue of our new partnership going? We don\u2019t know for definite. What we do know is Mike has to start showing this world leading tech can generate increased revenues. If he can\u2019t then will TB jettison IB? I reckon we should know far more within the next 3 months, update, phase 1 and annual results. The board can\u2019t hide from them and need to demonstrate a cohesive plan going forward.

Plus we need MS to start informing us of any signed contracts and their possible valuations/revenues. We have the world leading tech and possible magical elixir for cancer treatment but we are only valued at \u00a31.3m. We need to create a buzz about our products and start to get noticed.

Kane I seriously think we as shareholders have 3 options 1, think it is all a bunch of lies in which case I also would cash in 2, not want to risk any more and cut your losses and again cash in 3, currently, believe in the BoD, stay invested and see what happens over the next 3 months. Whatever we discuss on here isn\u2019t going to change what happens. We can argue, comment negatively etc about the BoD but if people feel that strongly then why stay? Investors have to make their own decisions based on their own thoughts and circumstances. I am firmly in option 3, whether I stay like that will depends on what happens in the future. The sp seems to have stabilised at this level and I can\u2019t see it varying until we get another RNS. Things that influence my option \u2022hopefully an indication of greater revenue \u2022possibly the sale of part of IB tech \u2022the phase 1 results, which are out of IB\u2019s control. \u2022GaM could still be a possibility saleable asset as Max has pointed out True and KS are suffering with their investments as well. We all hope there is a plan and as TB said we will hopefully get a comprehensive update in February. Until we have more information I can see no point in much more discussions. I hate to say it but I think it was semantic who quoted WB I believe and talked about not checking on the too often. Thanks",

Everything I have found about GaM suggests a positive result and helped to form a strong investment case, outweighing the obvious negatives that we have discussed ad infinitum. The idea of concentrating on the imaging side is something we have all heard before, I remember the \u2018step change\u2019 comment. I agree the imaging products are very good but they need to translate this into revenue and quickly, there are plenty of competitors in this space. The balance sheet is largely the result of the ill thought out decisions of two years ago, it could have been very different for everyone. I wish you all well and hope that this turns out good. Also I hope that a properly resourced and financed organisation progresses GaM as that is the real shame here. All the best, Shrek",

So the bit that people want to hear The company has being trying to engage with partners for a phase 2 partner. One of the technical issues has been the trial was being extended and one patient is still enrolled. I think that is great news for the patient. We do own the data but MCW will publish the results. These results haven\u2019t been completed yet, patient still alive. Possible partners obviously want the phase 1 results which have not been fully written up yet and Mr Brown couldn\u2019t give a definitive date for when they would be. It is MCW not IB that is publishing the data. The cost of the trial was hoped to be $2.5m with a start date of approximately in a year\u2019s time and taking about 3 years to complete. Which the company did  also look at self funding. The company has been talking to an institution/hospital about partnering with the trial. However, the other people never actually committed and a decision kept being delayed. What I hadn\u2019t realised is how the clinical trial process is quite competitive with oncologist\u2019s deciding who to refer their patient for a trial. As GBM is quite a niche disease (thankfully) and there being other trials available it is quite competitive. So last week at a board meeting and the non decision from the prospective partner a decision was taken to concentrate on the core business as this has been suffering due to the GBM trial. (We have commented previously how MS is trying to do too much) So my understanding is due to the lack of commitment from a prospective partner, the results still not being published, the competitiveness of clinical trials, oncologists choice, time the trial would take to complete we have stopped it to concentrate on the core IB business. (As stated in the RNS this could change I assume, let\u2019s see how much interest the results generate I would guess) We do own the data. After hearing this I personally agree with that decision. Truetide - discussed briefly and TB believes this is a wise future investment for the company. The board are hoping to share a comprehensive strategy update soon, hopefully February. Mr Brown has subsequently messaged  (after the meeting) to say the EAP is ongoing for now. Did I believe Mr Brown, the simple answer is yes I do. Do I now think the right decision was made re the trial, yes I do. Do I now wish we had been given more information in the last update, yes but they were rushing after the board meeting to update us with regards their decision. Will I keep investing in IBAI, yes Have I bought the Porsche yet, no I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brown for giving me the chance to talk to him. I hope I have given an accurate account of our conversation. Apologies if I have got any details wrong. I hope members of this board find this new information helpful. Personall",

TB funded this company at the outset and wants his pound of flesh if it comes good. I am sitting on my hands until the CLN/placing and I will then add accordingly.

I am not sure about how many people have said how many shares they own via email to BB but we have over the 3% to be classed as a group as a significant shareholder.

For both personal reasons, that some on the board are aware of, and me believing we need somebody with a far better understanding of how businesses work and the regulations I will stop posting incessantly and hope others take up the mantle to hold the board accountable whilst I take more of a back seat. I have tried to collate all the questions I could think of and the contacts for all the people I could think of. Will these people respond, my honest feeling is I don\u2019t know but if anything does happen in the future the more people we can say who asked questions the better. Yrek said he complained to the FCA previously so tha will be logged.  The company secretary Apex should have but they haven\u2019t replied to me yet.

That said I do think a couple  of TRUE's small investments are likely to perform better than  it's larger ones, which TB seems to have more control over.",

Several people have always said the imaging side was the money generator. I didn\u2019t believe them and hoped it was the trial (it may still be). I was wrong. I think we will just keep getting small fluctuations in the sp and people quietly building a position whilst we await the shareholder update, trial results, annual report and anything else we don\u2019t know about.

Recent in vitro data suggests that GaM may act as a radiosensitizer, which could dramatically change how brain tumors are treated. These findings prompted further investigation into the potential neurotoxic effects of GaM alone and in combination with radiation therapy (RT). METHODS Athymic rats were inoculated intracranially with treatment-resistant U87MG GBM cells. After tumor confirmation on MRI, animals received oral GaM 50mg/kg/day or vehicle. A pilot cohort received RT (21 Gy) 28 days later. MRI was performed on a 9.4T Bruker preclinical scanner using our custom acquisition protocol that included pre- and post-contrast anatomical T1 and T2 sequences, and DSC perfusion imaging. Longitudinal MR spectroscopy was collected from 2mm3 voxels placed in enhancing and non-enhancing areas. MRI studies were repeated every 10-14 days. Data was processed using Imaging Biometrics and Bruker Paravision analysis software, as well as custom-made MATLAB scripts. RESULTS Brain microvascular cells were unaffected by GaM therapy in vitro and in vivo. Advanced MRI biomarkers, such as fractional tumor burden maps, highlighted the cytotoxic effect of GaM on xenograft tumors but not on surrounding brain parenchyma. The addition of a subclinical RT dose did not alter these findings. Absence of necrosis-marking vinyl and lactate peaks on MR spectra, as well as histology, confirmed the safety profile of combination GaM+RT. Additionally, MR spectra of non-tumor brain following acute (14 days of GaM) were comparable to those of chronic (47 days of GaM) treatment, indicating no metabolic changes. Finally, absence of sensorimotor deficits provided further evidence of GaM\u2019s safety. These results are being validated currently in a larger cohort of animals. CONCLUSION GaM therapy does not cause overt neurotoxicity and is associated with excellent quality of life.\u201d From https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397501606_EXTH-134_The_oral_iron_mimetic_gallium_maltolate_is_neurologically_safe_in_a_rat_xenograft_model_of_glioblastoma_multimodal_assessment But what will the phase 1 show?

If the results are as good as we hope, the EAP data backs it up, plus use in other possible cancer treatments via (Vivan) then their must be a company out there willing to take a chance on it.

All this was distracting from the imaging work So the decision to not start the phase 2 trial which would take approx 1 year to prepare and a further 3 years to complete was taken. If we look at from the perspective of get some sales for imaging, build some momentum as MS can concentrate on just that side. If we self funded would we have to dilute further to raise the capital (2.5m) so that raises the prospect of \u201cshenanigans\u201d again. We still own the data and all the designations so surely that is worth an amount surely? Let\u2019s see what happens when the results are finally released is it the magical cancer elixir? Hopefully this month we will get a comprehensive update and possibly phase 1 results. Maybe an update on signed new contracts. How is the revenue of our new partnership going? We don\u2019t know for definite. What we do know is Mike has to start showing this world leading tech can generate increased revenues. If he can\u2019t then will TB jettison IB? I reckon we should know far more within the next 3 months, update, phase 1 and annual results. The board can\u2019t hide from them and need to demonstrate a cohesive plan going forward.

Kane I seriously think we as shareholders have 3 options 1, think it is all a bunch of lies in which case I also would cash in 2, not want to risk any more and cut your losses and again cash in 3, currently, believe in the BoD, stay invested and see what happens over the next 3 months. Whatever we discuss on here isn\u2019t going to change what happens. We can argue, comment negatively etc about the BoD but if people feel that strongly then why stay? Investors have to make their own decisions based on their own thoughts and circumstances. I am firmly in option 3, whether I stay like that will depends on what happens in the future. The sp seems to have stabilised at this level and I can\u2019t see it varying until we get another RNS. Things that influence my option \u2022hopefully an indication of greater revenue \u2022possibly the sale of part of IB tech \u2022the phase 1 results, which are out of IB\u2019s control. \u2022GaM could still be a possibility saleable asset as Max has pointed out True and KS are suffering with their investments as well. We all hope there is a plan and as TB said we will hopefully get a comprehensive update in February. Until we have more information I can see no point in much more discussions. I hate to say it but I think it was semantic who quoted WB I believe and talked about not checking on the too often. Thanks",

Everything I have found about GaM suggests a positive result and helped to form a strong investment case, outweighing the obvious negatives that we have discussed ad infinitum. The idea of concentrating on the imaging side is something we have all heard before, I remember the \u2018step change\u2019 comment. I agree the imaging products are very good but they need to translate this into revenue and quickly, there are plenty of competitors in this space. The balance sheet is largely the result of the ill thought out decisions of two years ago, it could have been very different for everyone. I wish you all well and hope that this turns out good. Also I hope that a properly resourced and financed organisation progresses GaM as that is the real shame here. All the best, Shrek",

So the bit that people want to hear The company has being trying to engage with partners for a phase 2 partner. One of the technical issues has been the trial was being extended and one patient is still enrolled. I think that is great news for the patient. We do own the data but MCW will publish the results. These results haven\u2019t been completed yet, patient still alive. Possible partners obviously want the phase 1 results which have not been fully written up yet and Mr Brown couldn\u2019t give a definitive date for when they would be. It is MCW not IB that is publishing the data. The cost of the trial was hoped to be $2.5m with a start date of approximately in a year\u2019s time and taking about 3 years to complete. Which the company did  also look at self funding. The company has been talking to an institution/hospital about partnering with the trial. However, the other people never actually committed and a decision kept being delayed. What I hadn\u2019t realised is how the clinical trial process is quite competitive with oncologist\u2019s deciding who to refer their patient for a trial. As GBM is quite a niche disease (thankfully) and there being other trials available it is quite competitive. So last week at a board meeting and the non decision from the prospective partner a decision was taken to concentrate on the core business as this has been suffering due to the GBM trial. (We have commented previously how MS is trying to do too much) So my understanding is due to the lack of commitment from a prospective partner, the results still not being published, the competitiveness of clinical trials, oncologists choice, time the trial would take to complete we have stopped it to concentrate on the core IB business. (As stated in the RNS this could change I assume, let\u2019s see how much interest the results generate I would guess) We do own the data. After hearing this I personally agree with that decision. Truetide - discussed briefly and TB believes this is a wise future investment for the company. The board are hoping to share a comprehensive strategy update soon, hopefully February. Mr Brown has subsequently messaged  (after the meeting) to say the EAP is ongoing for now. Did I believe Mr Brown, the simple answer is yes I do. Do I now think the right decision was made re the trial, yes I do. Do I now wish we had been given more information in the last update, yes but they were rushing after the board meeting to update us with regards their decision. Will I keep investing in IBAI, yes Have I bought the Porsche yet, no I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brown for giving me the chance to talk to him. I hope I have given an accurate account of our conversation. Apologies if I have got any details wrong. I hope members of this board find this new information helpful. Personall",

TB funded this company at the outset and wants his pound of flesh if it comes good. I am sitting on my hands until the CLN/placing and I will then add accordingly.

Does anyone know if the 0.51 buys are actually sells? Unless we get a big sell before the close the sp movement seems a bit weird. If it follows the normal pattern of this week it will probably jump up at close to be blue with a few percentage rise. Thanks",

Recent in vitro data suggests that GaM may act as a radiosensitizer, which could dramatically change how brain tumors are treated. These findings prompted further investigation into the potential neurotoxic effects of GaM alone and in combination with radiation therapy (RT). METHODS Athymic rats were inoculated intracranially with treatment-resistant U87MG GBM cells. After tumor confirmation on MRI, animals received oral GaM 50mg/kg/day or vehicle. A pilot cohort received RT (21 Gy) 28 days later. MRI was performed on a 9.4T Bruker preclinical scanner using our custom acquisition protocol that included pre- and post-contrast anatomical T1 and T2 sequences, and DSC perfusion imaging. Longitudinal MR spectroscopy was collected from 2mm3 voxels placed in enhancing and non-enhancing areas. MRI studies were repeated every 10-14 days. Data was processed using Imaging Biometrics and Bruker Paravision analysis software, as well as custom-made MATLAB scripts. RESULTS Brain microvascular cells were unaffected by GaM therapy in vitro and in vivo. Advanced MRI biomarkers, such as fractional tumor burden maps, highlighted the cytotoxic effect of GaM on xenograft tumors but not on surrounding brain parenchyma. The addition of a subclinical RT dose did not alter these findings. Absence of necrosis-marking vinyl and lactate peaks on MR spectra, as well as histology, confirmed the safety profile of combination GaM+RT. Additionally, MR spectra of non-tumor brain following acute (14 days of GaM) were comparable to those of chronic (47 days of GaM) treatment, indicating no metabolic changes. Finally, absence of sensorimotor deficits provided further evidence of GaM\u2019s safety. These results are being validated currently in a larger cohort of animals. CONCLUSION GaM therapy does not cause overt neurotoxicity and is associated with excellent quality of life.\u201d From https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397501606_EXTH-134_The_oral_iron_mimetic_gallium_maltolate_is_neurologically_safe_in_a_rat_xenograft_model_of_glioblastoma_multimodal_assessment But what will the phase 1 show?

If the results are as good as we hope, the EAP data backs it up, plus use in other possible cancer treatments via (Vivan) then their must be a company out there willing to take a chance on it. The question is how much would TB sell for? We all know he loves a special dividend. Phase 1 results Comprehensive update Results and what sales are we now generating for the IB products? The wait is excruciating but hopefully it will finally be worthwhile. Thanks",

All this was distracting from the imaging work So the decision to not start the phase 2 trial which would take approx 1 year to prepare and a further 3 years to complete was taken. If we look at from the perspective of get some sales for imaging, build some momentum as MS can concentrate on just that side. If we self funded would we have to dilute further to raise the capital (2.5m) so that raises the prospect of \u201cshenanigans\u201d again. We still own the data and all the designations so surely that is worth an amount surely? Let\u2019s see what happens when the results are finally released is it the magical cancer elixir? Hopefully this month we will get a comprehensive update and possibly phase 1 results. Maybe an update on signed new contracts. How is the revenue of our new partnership going? We don\u2019t know for definite. What we do know is Mike has to start showing this world leading tech can generate increased revenues. If he can\u2019t then will TB jettison IB? I reckon we should know far more within the next 3 months, update, phase 1 and annual results. The board can\u2019t hide from them and need to demonstrate a cohesive plan going forward. Just my thoughts based on discussion with Mr Brown. Thanks",

The question would be if TB/MS/KS thinks it better to sell the data (and all the designations) to another company who can afford the phase 2 via MCW? and maybe we could receive further compensation if it does get FDA approval. Plus we need MS to start informing us of any signed contracts and their possible valuations/revenues. We have the world leading tech and possible magical elixir for cancer treatment but we are only valued at \u00a31.3m. We need to create a buzz about our products and start to get noticed.

Kane I seriously think we as shareholders have 3 options 1, think it is all a bunch of lies in which case I also would cash in 2, not want to risk any more and cut your losses and again cash in 3, currently, believe in the BoD, stay invested and see what happens over the next 3 months. Whatever we discuss on here isn\u2019t going to change what happens. We can argue, comment negatively etc about the BoD but if people feel that strongly then why stay? Investors have to make their own decisions based on their own thoughts and circumstances. I am firmly in option 3, whether I stay like that will depends on what happens in the future. The sp seems to have stabilised at this level and I can\u2019t see it varying until we get another RNS. Things that influence my option \u2022hopefully an indication of greater revenue \u2022possibly the sale of part of IB tech \u2022the phase 1 results, which are out of IB\u2019s control. \u2022GaM could still be a possibility saleable asset as Max has pointed out True and KS are suffering with their investments as well. We all hope there is a plan and as TB said we will hopefully get a comprehensive update in February. Until we have more information I can see no point in much more discussions. I hate to say it but I think it was semantic who quoted WB I believe and talked about not checking on the too often. Thanks",

Everything I have found about GaM suggests a positive result and helped to form a strong investment case, outweighing the obvious negatives that we have discussed ad infinitum. The idea of concentrating on the imaging side is something we have all heard before, I remember the \u2018step change\u2019 comment. I agree the imaging products are very good but they need to translate this into revenue and quickly, there are plenty of competitors in this space. The balance sheet is largely the result of the ill thought out decisions of two years ago, it could have been very different for everyone. I wish you all well and hope that this turns out good. Also I hope that a properly resourced and financed organisation progresses GaM as that is the real shame here. All the best, Shrek",

So the bit that people want to hear The company has being trying to engage with partners for a phase 2 partner. One of the technical issues has been the trial was being extended and one patient is still enrolled. I think that is great news for the patient. We do own the data but MCW will publish the results. These results haven\u2019t been completed yet, patient still alive. Possible partners obviously want the phase 1 results which have not been fully written up yet and Mr Brown couldn\u2019t give a definitive date for when they would be. It is MCW not IB that is publishing the data. The cost of the trial was hoped to be $2.5m with a start date of approximately in a year\u2019s time and taking about 3 years to complete. Which the company did  also look at self funding. The company has been talking to an institution/hospital about partnering with the trial. However, the other people never actually committed and a decision kept being delayed. What I hadn\u2019t realised is how the clinical trial process is quite competitive with oncologist\u2019s deciding who to refer their patient for a trial. As GBM is quite a niche disease (thankfully) and there being other trials available it is quite competitive. So last week at a board meeting and the non decision from the prospective partner a decision was taken to concentrate on the core business as this has been suffering due to the GBM trial. (We have commented previously how MS is trying to do too much) So my understanding is due to the lack of commitment from a prospective partner, the results still not being published, the competitiveness of clinical trials, oncologists choice, time the trial would take to complete we have stopped it to concentrate on the core IB business. (As stated in the RNS this could change I assume, let\u2019s see how much interest the results generate I would guess) We do own the data. After hearing this I personally agree with that decision. Truetide - discussed briefly and TB believes this is a wise future investment for the company. The board are hoping to share a comprehensive strategy update soon, hopefully February. Mr Brown has subsequently messaged  (after the meeting) to say the EAP is ongoing for now. Did I believe Mr Brown, the simple answer is yes I do. Do I now think the right decision was made re the trial, yes I do. Do I now wish we had been given more information in the last update, yes but they were rushing after the board meeting to update us with regards their decision. Will I keep investing in IBAI, yes Have I bought the Porsche yet, no I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brown for giving me the chance to talk to him. I hope I have given an accurate account of our conversation. Apologies if I have got any details wrong. I hope members of this board find this new information helpful. Personall",

Virtually all boards of directors care about shareholders in the same way a race horse owner thinks of punters betting on his horse in the 3.15 at Ascot. TB funded this company at the outset and wants his pound of flesh if it comes good. I am sitting on my hands until the CLN/placing and I will then add accordingly. Good luck to everybody and if this share is causing you too mush grief and anger as seems to be the case with some holders (not you Tyke you are being proactive) perhaps better to take the hit and move on.",

I am not sure about how many people have said how many shares they own via email to BB but we have over the 3% to be classed as a group as a significant shareholder. Do we have enough to be over 5% to call for a general, I don\u2019t know? For both personal reasons, that some on the board are aware of, and me believing we need somebody with a far better understanding of how businesses work and the regulations I will stop posting incessantly and hope others take up the mantle to hold the board accountable whilst I take more of a back seat. I have tried to collate all the questions I could think of and the contacts for all the people I could think of. Will these people respond, my honest feeling is I don\u2019t know but if anything does happen in the future the more people we can say who asked questions the better. Yrek said he complained to the FCA previously so tha will be logged.  The company secretary Apex should have but they haven\u2019t replied to me yet.

If you don\u2019t like the company and people being well mannered that is your choice but I will keep saying have a good weekend because I actually mean that to people on here including you. Again, I hope you have a good weekend everybody. Thanks",

Several people have always said the imaging side was the money generator. I didn\u2019t believe them and hoped it was the trial (it may still be). I was wrong. I think we will just keep getting small fluctuations in the sp and people quietly building a position whilst we await the shareholder update, trial results, annual report and anything else we don\u2019t know about. For those posters who have left, goodbye and thank you. For those new to the board or are still hanging in there let\u2019s see what we hear in the next 3 months or so. And good luck.
