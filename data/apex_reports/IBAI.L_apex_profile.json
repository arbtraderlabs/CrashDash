          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 4979S\nImaging Biometrics Limited\n11 February 2026\nImaging Biometrics Limited\n(\"IBAI\" or the \"Company\")\nCompany Update\nIB Nimble Webinar - 27 February 2026\nImaging Biometrics Limited ('IBAI') comprises two subsidiary businesses, Imaging Biometrics LLC and Kirkstall Limited. In 2018, Imaging Biometrics, LLC ('IB') was acquired by Flying Brands Limited - now Imaging Biometrics Limited - and Kirkstall became part of the group in October last year.\nIn the subsequent eight years IB advanced several innovative technologies -including StoneChecker, LSN, and IB Zero G.\nThough substantial technical and developmental progress has been made over these years, it has not resulted in a concomitant commercial and revenue reward for shareholders. After considerable analysis we believe that this has been the consequence of pursuing too many projects with limited resources. One further consequence has been that we have invested less in the core legacy products that, in retrospect, we should have.\nWith the current market capitalisation of approximately \u00a31.2m, our focus will be on how to address and correct the wide gap between market perception and our actual and anticipated operational performance. As a first step we hereby provide a comprehensive and concise update on our live projects:\nThe last major release of\nIB Clinic\n, announced last fall, has seen initial adoption. Several existing clinical sites have upgraded to FTB Express processing, indicating interest in faster, more automated tumor-response metrics. Longitudinal reporting, identified as a useful quality enhancement by the neurosurgical community, will be added to improve the utility of IB Neuro and FTB maps. These updates further substantiate IB Clinic as the cornerstone of the product portfolio and position it for broader clinical adoption.\nThe next version of\nIB Nimble\nis nearing completion and includes integrated DICOM viewing, a feature requested by customers. This allows imaging data to be viewed directly within IB Nimble, facilitating the process from review to interpretation to clinical decision-making. To support this release and inform users, we will host a webinar on February 27, where the team will demonstrate the new capabilities and interact with customers.\nQSMetric\n, the platform for producing FDA-cleared, patented quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM), has attracted initial interest. The system accepts data directly from MRI scanners and generates QSM maps using a proprietary algorithm. It is now being prepared for distribution to trial sites.\nIB Zero G\nis a patented piece of intellectual property with potential long-term applications. However, advancing this technology requires significant resources and development time that affect focus on our primary products. In line with our strategy, IB Zero G will remain on hold until the Company's resources allow progress without impacting core business priorities.\nIB played a central role in advancing the\ngallium maltolate (GaM)\nprogramme through the successful completion of its Phase 1 clinical trial; the results of which have now been submitted for publication. As previously communicated, the scope and scale of a Phase 2 trial would require resources beyond what IB can provide independently. While we are proud of the significant milestones achieved-including FDA Fast Track designation, two Rare Pediatric Disease designations, and two Orphan Drug Designations-the long\u2011term development pathway for GaM would divert focus and resources from the continued year\u2011over\u2011year growth of IB's core portfolio. For these reasons, we will not focus on advancing the programme at this time. We do have commercialisation rights to the Phase 1 trial data and will remain alert for potential commercial opportunities.\nKirkstall Limited:\nDriven by the growing adoption of the improved QV1200 system and the expansion of our international distribution network, sales were \u00a3123k in 2025 compared with \u00a367k in 2024, an increase of 84%.\nIn 2025 distributors were contracted in three strategically important markets:\nChina\n,\nSouth Korea\nand the\nUnited States\n, with the appointment of MB Research Labs (\"MBR\"). With over 50 years of expertise in toxicology, MBR was one of the first CROs to offer\nin vitro\nand alternative testing methodologies and brings strong credibility and new market access.\nRelevance of UK and US government policies\nThe UK adheres to the \"3Rs\" (replace, reduce, refine) principle, overseen by the NC3Rs. In November 2025, a strategy was launched to phase out animal testing, with \u00a375 million funding for alternatives including organ-on-a-chip systems-microfluidic devices mimicking human organs using real cells to test drug effects without animals. Key timelines: end skin/eye irritation testing by 2026, botulinum toxin potency testing on mice by 2027, and reduce dog/primate use in pharmacokinetic studies by at least 35% by 2030. Organ-on-a-chip is highlighted for human-relevant results in areas like vaccine development and toxicity assessment.\nUS agencies like FDA, EPA, and NIH promote \"new approach methodologies\" (NAMs). The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 (2022) allowed alternatives to animal testing for drugs, enabling sponsors to use methods such as cell-based assays and computer models rather than requiring animal studies. In April 2025, FDA announced phasing out animal tests initially for monoclonal antibodies, prioritising organoids and computational models to assess drug safety. EPA targets eliminating mammalian testing by 2035. NIH funds human-based tech, establishing a centre for organoids in 2025 to reduce animal reliance. Organ-on-a-chip and organoid technologies are key for predicting human responses more accurately than animal models.\nCustomer Highlights\nGent University (Belgium):\nPublished research from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences has demonstrated that models of three organs can be connected using our system to explore gut-brain barrier communication. Notably, Gent University evaluated two competing organ-on-a-chip systems before selecting QV1200 for their research programme.\nBlood-Brain Barrier Research:\nProfessor\u202fCave and his team at Nottingham Trent University are developing next generation blood-brain barrier (BBB) organ on a chip system by combining their advanced nanofiber tissue scaffold inserts with Kirkstall's Quasi Vivo\u00ae platform to recreate realistic blood flow and neurovascular interactions. By growing the three key BBB cell types (endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes) inside the QV1200 system, which continuously circulates nutrients like real blood, the team has shown that the cells form stronger, intercellular connections and behave much more like they do in the human body. Importantly, the new scaffolds allow the cells to grow into their natural three-dimensional tissue structures, unlike conventional two-dimensional cell culture models where cells sit on flat plastic membranes without flow, limiting their physiological behavior. The QV1200 system's flowing, dynamic environment helps the BBB develop faster and far more effectively than older, static methods that lack real world physiological conditions. As a result, the platform offers a powerful, lifelike system for high throughput testing of new neurological treatments, enabling more reliable predictions of drug delivery and neuroprotective effects.\nProfessor Cave commented, \"Our partnership with Kirkstall and their Quasi Vivo\u00ae technology is enabling us to build BBB models that are closer to human physiology than ever before. By combining dynamic flow with our nanofiber scaffolds, we are creating a three-dimensional tissue platform that will transform how new neurological therapies are discovered and evaluated.\"\nTrevor Brown\nCEO of IBAI commented. \"We recognise and share the frustration and disappointment experienced by shareholders in recent years and are determined to find a new modus operandi for the future. In the current year we are projecting a small profit and importantly, expect to have sufficient working capital without the need to approach shareholders for new funds before this year end and hopefully beyond.\"\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact:\nImaging Biometrics Ltd\nTrevor Brown/Brett Skelly/Michael Schmainda\nTel: 020 7469 0930\nAlbR Capital Limited\n(Broker)\nLucy Williams\nTel: 020 7220 9797\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

While the trial remains open as one patient continues to receive treatment, enrollment was formally closed in November. The study authors are currently preparing the Phase 1 results for submission to a peer\u2011reviewed journal.\nThe directors believe it is no longer in shareholders' interests to embark on\na Phase 2 clinical trial of gallium maltolate\nas previously intended\n.\nThe financial\nand operational resources\nwould be better employed to concentrate upon nearer-term commercial objectives of our imaging solutions.\nT\nhe Company continues to hold two orphan drug designations, two rare pediatric disease designations, and an FDA Fast Track designation, all of which remain valuable assets that preserve future optionality.\nWe also acknowledge the GABRIEL pediatric trial-Gallium Maltolate for Better Outcomes in Relapsed/Refractory Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor and High\u2011Grade Glioma-\nplanned a\nt Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Imaging Biometrics is not formally involved in this study, but we\nwill\nclosely monitor its progress\nfor\nany scientific insights that may emerge. Developments from this trial may help inform the broader landscape of research related to gallium maltolate, and we will continue to follow it with interest.\nOur decision reflects a disciplined commitment to focus-ensuring that we invest where we can deliver the greatest value for patients, clinicians, and shareholders in the near term. The imaging business is\npromising\nstrong\ner\ncommercial performance, expanding clinical adoption, and increasing recognition for its technological differentiation.
