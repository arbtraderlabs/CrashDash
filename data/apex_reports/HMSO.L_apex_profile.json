Rob is an established and proven real estate leader who brings a wealth of experience and a track record of delivering shareholder value. Through a rigorous recruitment process, Rob stood out from a strong field of candidates as someone who was able to translate strategic insight into shareholder value creation through exceptional leadership. On behalf of the Board, I welcome Rob to Hammerson and look forward to working with him when he joins the business in December.\"\nRob Wilkinson added\n: \"I am honoured to have been appointed as CEO of Hammerson and look forward to working with the team. Under Rita-Rose's leadership the company has completed a major turnaround of the portfolio and restructured the balance sheet, firmly establishing Hammerson in a new phase of growth. I am excited to continue this journey, advancing the company's unique portfolio of prime retail and leisure anchored city destinations.\"\nNotes\nOther information\nRob Wilkinson is a Non-Executive Director of Derwent London plc, where he is a member of the Audit and Nominations Committees.

We continue to invest in destination repositioning and leasing to drive returns while our JV buyouts have enabled us to take full control of our assets and grow income. Demand for our prime space is robust, as evidenced by the operational performance we drove over the summer.
