The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta\u2019s website\nshortly (\nwww.voltafinance.com\n).\nPerformance and Portfolio Activity\nDear Investors,\nIn November, Volta Finance posted a net return of -0.6%, taking the year-to-date performance to +2.3%. For comparison, US High Yield bonds returned +7.8%*** and Euro High Yield bonds achieved +4.8% over the same period, while the Morningstar Leveraged Loan indices were up +5.2%*** in the US and +3.6% in Europe.\nThis month, financial markets became more unpredictable. Many investors worried that technology company shares, especially those linked to artificial intelligence (AI), might be overvalued. For example, after Nvidia\u2019s earnings report, there were concerns that investments in AI are not yet delivering strong profits. This led to a sharp drop in technology share prices and increased market volatility. Some companies with a lot of AI exposure, like Oracle, saw the cost of insuring their debt (through credit default swap) go up.\nAt the same time, economic data was mixed. The US economy showed some strength, but growth outside the technology sector was weak, and the job market continued to soften. Global events, such as political tensions and government decisions in the UK and Japan, also affected investor confidence. The US central bank kept interest rates steady and did not signal any cuts for December. However, as consumer confidence and retail sales weakened later in the month, many investors began to expect that interest rates might be cut soon.\nTurning to loans, the Morningstar LSTA Leveraged Loan Indices recorded returns of +0.32% in the US*** and +0.58% in Europe. While the European loan index had a relatively flat performance in terms of price variation, US Loans were slightly down although carry helped smooth their price impact. CLO tranches saw spreads stabilise for senior while Mezzanine tranches experienced spread widening, especially in Europe. European BB-rated CLOs reached +600 basis points notably for Reset Primary deals, while single-B from similar transactions reached +900 basis points. Regarding CLO Equity, credit concerns regarding tail in portfolios remained a focus in the context of Loan repricing squeezing value for Equity holders, although we noticed that distributions started to stabilise following a few quarters of steady decline.\nVolta Finance continued to invest actively in November, buying about \u20ac5.5 million worth of new investments. Most purchases were in new issues, which offered better value than in the secondary market. We invested in BB-rated and single-B rated tranches respectively in the +550bps context (US CLOs) and +925bps context (European CLOs) and participated in a European Equity tranche already owned by the fund. As a result, Volta Finance\u2019s cash position decreased down to 13% of its assets. The fund generated about \u20ac26 million in cash flow, which is about 20% of November\u2019s NAV on an annualized basis.\nIn terms of performance breakdown, Volta\u2019s CLO Equity tranches returned -1.5%** while CLO Debt tranches returned +0.8% performance**.\nAs of end of November 2025, Volta\u2019s NAV* was \u20ac263.6m, i.e. \u20ac7.21 per share.\n*It should be noted that approximately 0.14% of Volta\u2019s NAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta\u2019s NAV has already been published. Volta\u2019s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta\u2019s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently, such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The equivalent % proportions of Volta\u2019s NAV as of 30 September and 31 August were 0.07% and 0.07%, respectively.\n** \u201cperformances\u201d of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket, taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends, payments received from the assets over the period, and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless, some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.\n*** These figures are presented in USD.
