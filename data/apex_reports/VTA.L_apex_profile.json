      "Zero volatility metrics (ATR=0, StdDev=0) are statistically impossible for an active share; this pattern is typical of a suspended or delisted security.",
      "The 0.00p entry price is an outlier that often appears when a company undergoes a reverse split to 1:10 or 1:100, effectively wiping out the nominal price without changing the underlying value.",
      "The simultaneous drop in Google Trends momentum (-77%) and the 'DEAD_TICKER' signal suggests a coordinated removal from search results, a common tactic for companies that are being wound down or removed from the exchange."

    "contrarian_signals": [
      "If the ticker is indeed undergoing a reverse split, the nominal price of 0.00p could be a precursor to a re\u2011listing or a new issuance at a low base price, creating a rare, high\u2011risk entry point for contrarian traders."
