    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [
      "While conventional wisdom would treat a 0.00p ticker as dead, a contrarian view could consider that the company may still be listed but has not yet released a formal announcement; thus, a short\u2011term buy\u2011the\u2011dip (or short) could be viable if the ticker is reinstated with a minimal price.",

    "risk_warnings": [
      "Liquidity risk: with no market trades, any attempt to transact would likely be impossible or require an extraordinary price.",

    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If the ticker is re\u2011listed or a new RNS emerges, a rapid re\u2011entry strategy could capitalize on the initial low price, but only after confirming the company\u2019s legal status.",
