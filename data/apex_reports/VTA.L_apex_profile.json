      "Contradiction between a *dead_ticker* status and a sharp upward momentum \u2013 a classic sign of a \u201cflash\u201d or algorithmic trade on an inactive symbol.",
      "Zero volatility paired with a large momentum swing indicates a single block trade or spoofing rather than organic price discovery.",
      "The crash bottom score of 12/21, combined with no risk flags, hides the fact that the company may have been suspended for regulatory reasons, a risk not captured by the standard risk flag set."

    "contrarian_signals": [
      "The +333% momentum on a dead ticker could signal a rebound if the company is re\u2011listed or merged, offering a contrarian entry point for a high\u2011risk, high\u2011reward play.",

    "risk_warnings": [
      "High likelihood of delisting or suspension \u2013 trading may be halted with no further price action.",
      "Zero volatility and lack of fundamentals expose the asset to manipulation; any price movement may be illiquid and non\u2011reversible.",

    "opportunity_flags": [

    "narrative_summary": "VTA.L appears to be an inactive or delisted AIM listing, yet it experienced a sudden 333% price surge likely due to low liquidity or spoofing. The absence of fundamentals, zero volatility, and an extreme crash bottom suggest a distressed or liquidating entity, making any trading highly speculative. Traders should view the spike as a potential contrarian play if a revival is imminent, but must remain wary of delisting risks and manipulation."
