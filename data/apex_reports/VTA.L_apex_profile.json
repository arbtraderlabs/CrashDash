      "The stock has suffered a 99.1% drawdown to a nominal price of 0.00p, indicating a likely delisting, bankruptcy, or regulatory suspension.",

    "hidden_patterns": [
      "The contradictory combination of a \u2018DEAD_TICKER\u2019 flag with an \u2018UP\u2019 interpretation and a positive momentum surge suggests a data\u2011glitch or algorithmic re\u2011entry pattern that is often missed by manual checks.",

      "Zero liquidity: With ATR and volatility at zero, any price movement would be driven by a handful of trades and is subject to extreme manipulation or slippage.",

The absence of public catalysts and zero volatility create substantial liquidity and regulatory risks, but the unexpected positive momentum offers a contrarian play for highly risk\u2011tolerant investors who are willing to act on a speculative catalyst."
