      "All signals (price, Google Trends, sentiment, RNS, volatility) uniformly flag VTA.L as a dead ticker: 99% drawdown, zero volatility, no social or search interest, and no recent filings.",
      "The entry price of 0.00p and zero ATR/StdDev are typical placeholders used by automated risk engines to mark a suspended or delisted stock rather than an active market instrument.",

    "hidden_patterns": [
      "Perfect alignment of zero activity across trends, sentiment, and volatility is a classic signature of a ticker that has been delisted or suspended but still appears in legacy feeds.",
      "The crash signal\u2019s use of 0.00p as the entry price is a hidden flag used by risk systems to denote a non\u2011existent or non\u2011tradeable instrument."

      "Despite the 'dead' status, the 99% drawdown from a previous peak indicates a recent liquidation event; distressed investors sometimes target such stocks for reverse takeovers or asset recovery."

      "High probability of trading suspension or delisting: liquidity is effectively zero and positions cannot be exited.",
      "Data integrity risk: zero ATR and StdDev may stem from feed errors; relying on this ticker for any strategy is perilous.",

    "narrative_summary": "VTA.L displays the textbook profile of a dead ticker: zero activity across all metrics, a 99% drawdown, and no recent corporate announcements. The data flags a likely delisting or suspension, making normal trading impossible. However, the dramatic price collapse hints at a recent liquidation event, creating a narrow window for distressed investors to acquire assets at a fraction of their intrinsic value, albeit with severe liquidity and regulatory risks."
