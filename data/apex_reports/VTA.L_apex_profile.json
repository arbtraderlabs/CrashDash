      "The base risk score of 12/21 does not reflect the lack of liquidity or data, suggesting the algorithmic model is mis\u2011aligned with the real\u2011world trading environment."

      "Contradiction between the 'DEAD_TICKER' signal and the 'UP' momentum suggests either a data feed anomaly or a coordinated hype campaign for a dormant company.",

      "No liquidity (ATR 0, StdDev 0) means orders would be executed at extreme prices or not at all; the security behaves like paper rather than a tradable asset.",

This mismatch hints at a potential speculative rally tied to a pending corporate event, but the absence of liquidity and formal filings makes any trade highly speculative. Traders should monitor regulatory filings closely for signs of relisting or takeover before committing capital."
