ADX holds the remaining 49.2% shareholding in Danube via its wholly owned subsidiary ADX Energy Panonia SRL (\"Panonia\"), and is the operator of Parta.\nPanonia has been unable to perform the work plan in Parta due to regulatory constraints, delays and operational access restrictions.\nADX was reluctant to enter into exploration phase 2, with additional significant commitments, due to the inability to perform the phase 1 program despite its reasonable efforts.\nAs a result ADX has been in discussions with the Romanian Regulatory Authorities regarding an extension of the Parta licence. Despite repeated requests,\nthe Regulatory Authority has advised that the exploration phase 1 of the licence has expired. Additionally, the Regulatory Authority has issued Panonia with invoices totalling EUR 4.2 million relating to alleged expenditures relating to the unperformed exploration commitments applicable to Parta.\nADX, on behalf of Panonia, will formally dispute these invoices\non the basis of having incurred significant costs to address the unforeseen challenges attributable to the work program, as well as due to the regulatory delays and access restrictions which have prevented Panonia from entirely fulfilling the work program, and denied Panonia the ability to benefit from the potential upside from making a discovery.\nFurther details can be found in the ADX Energy Ltd ASX release published on 24 October 2025 -\nhttps://investors.adx-energy.com/announcements/7225646\n.\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nCavendish - Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK version of the market abuse regulation (EU No. 596/2014) as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nNotes to Editors\nReabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects. Reabold's strategy is to invest in low-risk, near-term projects which it considers to have significant valuation uplift potential, with a clear monetisation plan, where receipt of such proceeds will be returned to shareholders and re-invested into further growth projects.

Additionally, Reabold will receive new shares in Beacon, and will subscribe for additional shares as part of the Placing (as defined below), to take it's shareholding to approximately 29% of the enlarged capital of Beacon. The Proposed Transaction will complete in two phases, as detailed below.\nStephen Williams, Co-CEO of Reabold, commented:\n\"Through this transaction, Reabold has successfully crystalised value from the Colle Santo gas project, both through the Earn Out mechanism and the receipt of Beacon shares, whilst protecting Reabold shareholders from any further funding requirement, increased development costs or dilution in the asset. The Earn Out, which has a value of up to\n\u20ac\n16 million, offers Reabold and its shareholders a significant uplift in value from initial investment and ensures that Reabold shareholders will continue to benefit from the attractive cash flow generated from the project.\n\"In a similar way to the Victory project, which recently came onstream as an important supplier of indigenous gas to the UK, this is the Reabold strategy in action; unlocking strategic gas discoveries\nwhich have considerable valuation uplift potential by securing funding to bring projects to the next stage of development.\n\"We are pleased to partner with Beacon, which recognises the value of the Colle Santo project and its strategic importance in Italy\u00a0in securing national gas supply.\n\"As previously announced, a number of funding solutions are being progressed by LN Energy to enable the development of Colle Santo, including the prepay and offtake agreement with Gunvor, vendor financing agreements with Italfluid, and the potential for Italian government grants. With the positive regulatory decision announced last month, we are confident that the project will be brought into production with first gas in 2027.\"\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nEarn Out value of up to\n\u20ac16 million\n\u00b7\nAttractive cash flow stream:\nReabold will receive 25% of its pro rata share of cash flow from the Colle Santo project once on production, capped at\n\u20ac\n16 million\n\u00b7\nNear-term monetisation:\nActive work programme designed to achieve FID in mid-2026 and first gas in 2027\n\u00b7\nAdvanced financing plan\n: Additional financing options are in place with non-binding funding agreements with Italfluid for a vendor financing agreement and Gunvor through a prepay and offtake agreement; potential government grants are also being explored\nBeacon will be seeking to admit its shares to trading on AIM and to carry out a placing to new and existing investors (\"Placing\") to raise approximately \u00a33.5 million to finance the Colle Santo project through FID and towards first production,\u00a0as well as the associated required working capital. Reabold has agreed to support the Placing by participating with an investment of \u00a3750,000.

Reabold holds a c.69.9% economic interest in West Newton and PEDL 183 via its c.79.8% shareholding in Rathlin, which, in turn, has a 66.67% interest in PEDL 183. In addition, Reabold has a 16.665% direct licence interest in PEDL 183.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nFeasibility study and evaluation of the potential for an early development and monetisation strategy at West Newton\n\u00b7\nThe potential use of gas produced from the existing wells to generate on-site electricity and power crypto mining activities\n\u00b7\nEntered a non-binding LOI with 360 Energy to scope and design a potential bitcoin mining solution at West Newton, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals\n\u00b7\nProvides early production and cash flow in advance of planned full field gas development, offering a significant near-term value generating opportunity\nBitcoin Mining Evaluation\nRathlin has been evaluating ways of generating additional value through early production schemes ahead of the planned longer term full field development at West Newton. In particular, Rathlin has been looking at development concepts that would co-locate gas-powered generators and crypto mining equipment at the West Newton A and West Newton B sites, which would be fuelled by the natural gas produced from the existing wells at those sites, namely; West Newton A-2 (WNA-2), West Newton A-1 (WNA-1) and West Newton B-1z (WNB-1z).\nReabold is pleased to announce that Rathlin has entered a non-binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with 360 Energy, Inc. (\"360 Energy\"), a natural gas offtake and monetisation solutions provider, headquartered in Austin, TX. Under the terms of the LOI, Rathlin will work with 360 Energy to scope, design, and subject to regulatory and third party approvals, deploy 360 Energy's proven In-Field Computing (\"IFC\") technology, which is a natural gas offtake solution, designed to convert produced natural gas directly into electricity to power 360 Energy's on-site data centres, generating revenues from bitcoin production. While this engagement is at an early stage, this relationship has the potential to enable Rathlin to realise significant returns from natural gas volumes from wells that would not otherwise contribute to either the early production scheme or the full field development, and Rathlin's preliminary economic estimates indicate that cryptocurrency mining could deliver very attractive returns.\nThe LOI envisages the IFC initially being deployed at the West Newton A site, converting produced natural gas from the WNA-2 well into bitcoin, and subsequently being rolled out for the WNA-1 and WNB-1z wells.\nAs such, bitcoin mining development plans will compliment both the early production scheme and the full field development. As announced on\u00a013 June 2024, the pre-tax NPV(10) of the West Newton project was calculated to be\u00a0US$179 million\u00a0net to Reabold under the full field development plan.\nRathlin intends to incorporate IFC technology into its existing operations, as well as in its asset evaluation processes and capital allocation strategy moving forward. The parties are working towards entering a binding, definitive agreement that is expected to be based on the terms outlined in the LOI.\nSachin Oza, Co-CEO of Reabold Resources commented:\n\"We are delighted to announce this initial step as an additional element of value creation from the West Newton field. Generating early revenue from the existing well stock also moves the West Newton project further forward in unlocking the full value of this significant natural gas resource.\nWe believe that the creation and accumulation of new Bitcoin through mining operations offers a significantly enhanced, sustainable return, and one which is superior to simple cash purchases and accumulation of Bitcoin on the balance sheet, popularly referred to as a Bitcoin treasury strategy.\nThe accumulation of mined Bitcoin, taking advantage of Rathlin's access to extremely low cost energy, is both a precursor and supplement to the unlocking of the substantial low-cost natural gas at West Newton, which we believe will play an invaluable role in UK energy security in the years ahead.\nIn addition, the UK government's\u00a0AI\u00a0Opportunities Action Plan, announced in January this year, set out new measures that will create dedicated\u00a0AI\u00a0Growth Zones. We believe that AI/data centres will be a key growth area of the UK economy in the coming years, and that West Newton's onshore setting and low operating costs also ",

Acquisition completed in January 2025, taking Reabold's shareholding in Rathlin to 79.8% and its economic interest in West Newton to 69.9%.\n\u00b7\nCash and cash equivalents up 15% at \u00a36.2 million as at 31 December 2024, compared with \u00a35.4 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\u00b7\nFinal tranche cash proceeds of \u00a34.4 million for the sale of Corallian, received from Shell in January 2024.\n\u00b7\nIncreased interest in LNEnergy Limited (\"LNEnergy\") by 3.1% in 2024 taking interest to 29.2% at December 31, 2024. LNEnergy is the manager and owner of LNEnergy S.R.L., the Italian company which has applied for the Colle Santo gas field concession, a highly material gas resource with an estimated 65Bcf of 2P reserves1. In May 2025, Reabold increased its interest in LNEnergy to 45.1% via the conversion of \u00a3500,000 of loan notes.\n\u00b7\nExecution of a non-binding Heads of Agreement between\u00a0Gunvor International B.V. (\"Gunvor\") and\u00a0LNEnergy for the purchase of Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") by Gunvor from LNEnergy from the Colle Santo gas field.\no\nAgreement provides for a potential prepayment for a portion of the first five years of deliveries to help fund the development.\n\u00b7\nAt West Newton, a Gas Export Feasibility study completed by independent energy consultants, CNG Services Limited, concluded that as a precursor to the intended West Newton full field development, an initial single well development and gas export plan can accelerate production and cash flow whilst requiring limited capital expenditure, giving the joint venture (\"JV\") partnership the ability to drill future wells out of cash flow. See Review of Operations section below for further details.\no\nThe single well development plan benefits from early cash generation with the ability to drill future wells out of cash flow. Following drilling and testing of this horizontal well, first gas is expected after 18 months with an associated development capex estimated to be c.\u00a312 million.\n\u00b7\nThe\u00a0North Sea Transition Authority\u00a0(\"NSTA\") approved a revised work programme for PEDL 183 onshore\u00a0UK, which contains the West Newton field. The JV partnership for PEDL 183 is expected to approve a forward plan, which will initially consist of the re-entry and recompletion of the West Newton A-2 well in order to establish sustained gas flow. The JV partnership believes this is a low risk and low cost approach to derisk the project.\n1\u00a0RPS estimate,\u00a0September 2022\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nCavendish - Broker and Nominated Adviser\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nNotes to Editors\nReabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects.

With our strict investment criteria, we aim to support Europe's energy supply and security by unlocking the value of undeveloped domestic gas resources that are substantially de-risked from a technical perspective. Our two core gas assets, West Newton (UK onshore) & Colle Santo (Italy onshore), are highly material gas resources that have the potential to significantly increase energy supply and security in the UK and Italy respectively, at a time when geopolitical tension, conflict and market volatility have made the critical need for home grown, secure energy sources a priority for governments who remains acutely aware of exposure to external gas supply risks. Early in the year, we received the final tranche of the payment from Shell U.K. Limited (\"Shell\") for the sale of the Victory gas project, which represented a significant moment in the delivery of Reabold's strategy and business model. We now seek to replicate this success at West Newton and Colle Santo and realise the value of our core assets.\nAt West Newton we were pleased to announce that the ",

Paul has a deep understanding of the technical, regulatory and commercial environment in the UK and this experience will be invaluable in progressing West Newton\"\nPaul Harris added:\n\"I believe strongly in securing the UK's energy supply and the economic, fiscal and environmental case for doing this with domestically produced gas has never been stronger. As the largest undeveloped onshore gas field in the UK, West Newton is an important UK gas asset which I look forward to helping the team progress forward to production.\"\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nCavendish - Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nNotes to Editors\nReabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects.

Following drilling and testing of this horizontal well, first gas is expected after 18 months with an associated development capex estimated to be ca. \u00a312 million.\no\nNew initial phase, based upon a single well development, materially reduces the financial hurdle to reach production and retains the potential for full development.\nSachin Oza, Co-CEO of Reabold, commented:\n\"We are thrilled to be further increasing our interest in Rathin as it delivers the upcoming work programme, which would de-risk the West Newton development plans. Furthermore, Reabold will also be increasing its exposure to the broader PEDL 183 licence area which, we believe, has significant running room beyond West Newton, and on highly attractive terms.\n\"The UK budget has provided much needed fiscal clarity and against this more stable backdrop, we are confident in our ability to progress the West Newton work programme and bring this important UK gas asset to the next stage of development and monetisation. As the energy transition in the UK moves forward, the economic, fiscal, energy security and environmental case for using indigenous gas has never been stronger.\"\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nCavendish - Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nNotes to Editors\nReabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects.

Following this conversion, Reabold will hold approximately 29.2% of LNEnergy's enlarged share capital.\nLNEnergy is the manager and owner of a 20% interest in LNEnergy S.R.L.

The results are included below and are also available at\nwww.reabold.com\n.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nCash and cash equivalents up 41% at \u00a37.6 million as at 30 June 2024, compared with \u00a35.4 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\u00b7\nFinal tranche cash proceeds of \u00a34.4 million for the sale of Corallian, received from Shell in January 2024.\n\u00b7\nIn August 2024, agreed to further increase interest in LNEnergy Limited (\n\"LNEnergy\") taking Reabold's total shareholding to approximately 27.1% of LNEnergy's enlarged share capital. LNEnergy is the manager of LNEnergy S.R.L., the Italian company which has applied for the Colle Santo gas field concession, a highly material gas resource with an estimated 65Bcf of 2P reserves1.\n\u00b7\nExecution of a non-binding Heads of Agreement between\u00a0Gunvor International B.V. (\"Gunvor\") and\u00a0LNEnergy for the purchase of Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") by Gunvor from LNEnergy from the Colle Santo gas field.\no\nHoA provides for a potential prepayment for a portion of the first five years of deliveries to help fund the development.\n\u00b7\nAt West Newton, a Gas Export Feasibility study completed by independent energy consultants, CNG Services Limited, concluded that as a precursor to the intended West Newton full field development, an initial single well development and gas export plan can accelerate production and cash flow whilst requiring limited capital expenditure, giving the joint venture (\"JV\") partnership the ability to drill future wells out of cash flow. See Review of Operations section below for further details.\no\nThe single well development plan benefits from early cash generation with the ability to drill future wells out of cash flow. Following drilling and testing of this horizontal well, first gas is expected after 18 months with an associated development capex estimated to be c.\u00a312 million.\n\u00b7\nThe\u00a0North Sea Transition Authority\u00a0(\"NSTA\") approved a revised work programme for PEDL 183 onshore\u00a0UK, which contains the West Newton field. The JV partnership for PEDL 183 is expected to approve a forward plan, which will initially consist of the re-entry and recompletion of an existing West Newton well in order to establish sustained gas flow. The JV partnership believes this is a low risk and low cost approach to derisk the project.\n1\nRPS estimate,\u00a0September 2022\nSachin Oza and Stephen Williams, Co-CEOs of Reabold, commented:\n\"\nReabold enters the second half of the year with a strong balance sheet and a number of exciting catalysts on the horizon.\nThe Company is excited by the potential of the Colle Santo gas project, which holds significant gas reserves, and the regulatory process continues to be encouraging. We are pleased LNEnergy has established a strong relationship with Gunvor in the context of a gas offtake partner.\n\"\nThe revised work programme for PEDL 183 confirms that significant value can be unlocked at West Newton through the early production plan, which is technically robust and economically attractive due to a low capex requirement, and the JV remains focused on delivering this strategic UK gas project.\n\"\nWe look forward to replicating the success of the Corallian sale elsewhere in the portfolio as we carry out the Reabold strategy to create value for shareholders.\"\nEnquiries:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited - Nominated & Financial Adviser\nJames Spinney\nJames Dance\nRob Patrick\nCavendish - Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nreaboldenquiries@camarco.co.uk\nForward looking statements\nThis disclosure contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the business of Reabold and certain of the plans and objectives of Reabold that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties.

The Study has concluded that as a precursor to the intended West Newton full field development, an initial single\nwell development and gas export plan could accelerate production and cash flow whilst requiring limited capital expenditure.\nIn addition, the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\") has approved a revised work programme for PEDL 183 onshore UK, which contains the West Newton field.\nThe Feasibility Study:\n\u00b7\nConfirms the technical and economic viability of a single well development plan, with:\no\nInitial gas production from a single horizontal well\no\nGas processing through a modular plant, and\no\nSales gas tied in from the West Newton A site to the National Transmission System at an existing above the ground installation via a 3.5 kilometre pipeline\n\u00b7\nConcludes a single well development has excellent project economics benefitting from:\no\nEarly cash flow with the ability to drill\nfuture development wells out of cash flow generated\no\nLow c\napex for the associated project infrastructure, estimated at ca. \u00a312m, and\no\nAn attractive NPV(10) of ca. \u00a333m and an associated IRR of 29%\n\u00b7\nFirst gas soon after drilling and completing a producer well, to be within 18 months from completion of drilling the next well at West Newton\nAlthough the early production demonstrates highly attractive standalone economics, it is envisaged that it will be a precursor to the full field conceptual development plan as previously disclosed, which, under current conditions, has an associated pre-tax NPV(10) of ca. US$179m (approximately \u00a3140m), net to Reabold.\nNSTA Approved Revised Minimum Required Work Programme for PEDL 183:\n\u00b7\nRe-enter and recomplete or sidetrack one of the currently suspended wells on or before 30 June 2026\n\u00b7\nRe-enter and recomplete or sidetrack one of the remaining suspended wells or drill and complete a new deviated or horizontal well on or before 30 June 2027, and\n\u00b7\nSubmit a field development plan on or before 30 June 2027\nThe joint venture (\"JV\") partnership for PEDL 183 is likely to approve a forward plan, which will initially consist of the re-entry and recompletion of an existing West Newton well in order to establish sustained gas flow. The JV partnership believes this is a low risk and low cost approach to derisk the project and Reabold will update the market on the planned activity at West Newton.\nThe JV is fully funded for re-entry and recompletion and operational activity is anticipated to commence during 2024. Further updates will be provided in due course.\nReabold holds a ca. 56% economic interest in West Newton and PEDL 183 via its ca. 59.5% shareholding in Rathlin, which, in turn, has a 66.67% interest in PEDL 183. In addition, Reabold has a 16.665% direct licence interest in PEDL 183.\nSachin Oza, Co-CEO of Reabold, commented:\n\"\nT\nhe CNG Feasibility Study highlights the opportunity to unlock significant near-term value from the West Newton project through the early production plan. The study confirms that the early production plan is both technically robust and economically attractive with a low capex requirement.\n\"This phased development plan allows g\nas production to be brought to market within months of drilling, generating significant early cash flow whilst we progress the full field development plan. With the industry currently suffering from a lack of available development capital, the ability to achieve early production with limited capex is strategically extremely valuable.\n\"With the necessary approval from the NSTA for the revised work programme for PEDL 183 secured, Reabold can continue to progress this important UK gas project in the most optimal manner.\n\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK version of the market abuse regulation (EU No. 596/2014) as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nENDS\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nStrand\u00a0Hanson Limited\u00a0- Nominated & Financial Adviser\nJames Spinney\nJames Dance\nRob Patrick\nCavendish - Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nNotes to Editors\nReabold\nReabold Resources plc\u00a0has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects.

Reabold's strategy is to invest in low-risk, near-term projects which it considers to have significant valuation uplift potential, with a clear monetisation plan, where receipt of such proceeds will be returned to shareholders and re-invested into further growth projects. This strategy is illustrated by the recent sale of the undeveloped Victory gas field to Shell, the proceeds of which are being returned to shareholders and re-invested.\nStrategic Report\nChair's letter\nIn the financial year ended 31 December 2023, Reabold continued with its strategy of identifying, investing in, maturing and monetising undeveloped gas discoveries with significant resources and near-term production potential. Our emphasis is on investing in UK and European gas assets to enhance domestic energy supply and security, which has been exposed in recent years by the Ukraine war. The sale of the Victory strategic gas project to Shell U.K. Limited (\"Shell\") in late 2022 reaffirmed our view that there is further opportunity for value creation by applying our strategy to similar assets. Portfolio activity undertaken in 2023 reflects this approach; Reabold reinvested some of the proceeds from the Victory transaction into a significant new opportunity in Italy, the Colle Santo onshore gas field, and continued to commit resources to and develop the attractive prospects of the PEDL183 onshore licence at West Newton in the UK. Other investments in the Reabold portfolio, such as the Romanian licences, continue to hold attractive optional value in the long-term but were not a capital allocation priority in 2023.\nAt West Newton, we were pleased to receive approval permits from the Environment Agency, a key step forward in enabling further licence activity. We were however disappointed with the delay in drilling of the first development well, which had been targeted for the second half of 2023. Rathlin, the site operator, was unable to resolve funding for its own share in 2023, which we believe is a consequence of the fiscal and political instability in the UK. With a strong balance shee",

The report on the Carbon Intensity of the West Newton Field can be found at the following link:\nhttps://reabold.com/investors/reports-presentations/\nReabold holds a ca. 56% economic interest in West Newton and PEDL183 via its 16.665% licence interest in PEDL183 and a 59% shareholding in Rathlin\nEnergy (UK) Limited (\"\nRathlin\n\")\n, the operator of the Joint Venture,\nwhich, in turn, has a 66.67% interest in PEDL183\n.\nThe GaffneyCline study highlighted the following:\n\u00b7\nThe West Newton project has an AA rating for Carbon Intensity for its potential upstream gas and condensate production, the lowest possible carbon intensity rating category on GaffneyCline's scale\n\u00b7\nThe West Newton field has a Carbon Intensity significantly lower than the UK average and onshore and offshore analogues. It is also significantly lower than the average imported liquified natural gas (LNG), based on the NSTA Natural Carbon Footprint Analysis published in July 2023\n\u00b7\nBased on the study, GaffneyCline estimates that West Newton could produce the equivalent of just 2.87 grams of CO\n2\nper megajoule of energy developed (gCO\n2\neq./MJ)\n\u00b7\nAs the development proceeds and project knowledge increases, there is potential to improve the Carbon Intensity by further reducing fugitive, flaring and venting emissions and by gas-to-grid development, reducing on site gas and condensate processing, and using the shortest possible route to the National Grid\nCarbon Intensity Rating for West Newton Gas Development Concept\nSource: GaffneyCline\nReabold is focused on minimising carbon emissions and the environmental footprint of the projects it invests in, whilst continuing to develop strategic gas assets to secure domestic gas supply and energy security.\nThe demand for energy is increasing and the challenge to meet the world's energy needs sustainably and efficiently requires managing and reducing harmful emissions. Hydrocarbons will continue to play an ongoing part in ensuring a secure and affordable supply of energy in the UK, while building the clean energy system of the future.\nReabold believes that domestically produced gas is significantly cleaner and supports the drive to net zero greenhouse gas emissions more than imported hydrocarbons.\nSachin Oza, Co-CEO of Reabold, commented:\n\"Reabold takes its commitment to responsible hydrocarbon production very seriously and we are therefore pleased to publish the excellent results of the West Newton Carbon Intensity study. The AA rating demonstrates the low carbon credentials of the West Newton project and is an example of the opportunities available in the UK to power the country through lower carbon, home grown energy, rather than relying on expensive and more carbon intensive imports.\n\"We believe West Newton is an important strategic asset to the UK as the country looks to secure domestic energy supply for secure and affordable energy, at a time when the country is exposed to potentially significant gas supply disruptions. The study proves that the operator, Rathlin, is a responsible hydrocarbon producer complying with best environmental practice to produce much needed UK hydrocarbons in the most efficient and environmentally friendly way possible.\n\"Reabold is committed to the highest standards of environmental processes and we incorporate these responsibilities into our operational decision-making and investments.\"\nThe Carbon Intensity study\nThe Carbon Intensity study on the West Newton gas development project was calculated by GaffneyCline, using a tool called the Oil Production Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimator (\"\nOPGEE\n\"), developed at Stanford University with support from GaffneyCline. This tool is used, amongst other applications, by the California Air Resources Board for regulation of transport fuel related Green House Gas (\"GHG\") emissions.\nThe OPGEE tool selects parameters from a range of 'smart' defaults, however, these are not always optimal for specific fields.\nGaffneyCline was then able to harness appropriate parameters available from its proprietary Global database of Carbon Intensity evaluations for over 9,000 gas and oil fields, categorised with metadata for analogue field identification, and a classification system for recovery mechanism.\nAnalysis of the results of this GaffneyCline study concludes that a West Newton gas development will have carbon intensities significa",

(\"\nGunvor\n\")\nand LNEnergy Limited (\"\nLNEnergy\n\") for the purchase of liquefied natural gas (\"\nLNG\n\") by Gunvor from LNEnergy from the Colle Santo gas field, located onshore Italy\n. LNEnergy has the exclusive right to acquire a 90% interest in Colle Santo and Reabold owns a 26.1% equity interest in LNEnergy.\nThe HoA provides the terms on which Gunvor will purchase LNG from LNEnergy at its planned small-scale LNG production facility at the Colle Santo gas field. Gunvor will purchase approximately 44,000 tonnes of LNG per annum. The point of sale will be the truck loading flange at the small-scale LNG plant, and the LNG will then be delivered by truck in Italy. The price for the LNG will be aligned with the Italian PSV price. The contract term will be for an indefinite period with a minimum term of five years.\nThe HoA also provides for a potential prepayment by Gunvor for a portion of the first five years of deliveries, with such amounts subject to prepayment being a total of approximately 66,000 tonnes of LNG, or 999,000 MWh. The average forward Italian PSV gas price for the years 2025-2030 is currently approximately \u20ac30 / MWh. The prepayment is conditional on agreeing definitive transaction documentation and LNEnergy obtaining the required permits to construct and operate the LNG production facility.\nOn the basis of the HoA, LNEnergy and Gunvor intend to negotiate a fully-termed LNG sale and purchase agreement over the next six months. During such time, LNEnergy will exclusively discuss the sale and purchase of LNG from Colle Santo with Gunvor.\nFurther announcements will be made in due course.\nAbout Gunvor Group\nGunvor is one of the world's largest independent commodities trading houses by turnover, creating logistics solutions that safely and efficiently move physical energy from where it is sourced and stored to where it is demanded most. Gunvor has strategic investments in industrial infrastructure - refineries, pipelines, storage and terminals - that complement our core trading activity and generate sustainable value across the global supply chain for our customers. The company, which in 2023 generated US$127 billion in revenue on 177 million MT of volumes, is the leading independent global trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nStephen Williams, Co-CEO of Reabold commented:\n\"We are delighted with this progress towards an extremely significant milestone for our LNG project at Colle Santo in Italy. The agreement envisages a counterparty of the highest quality potentially providing both offtake and a prepay, which is extremely valuable for the project in these times of capital scarcity in the industry.\n\"In keeping with Reabold's broader strategy, Colle Santo has the potential to provide significant, reliable and low carbon energy into the Italian market, improving European energy security whilst contributing to an efficient energy transition.\"\nENDS\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nStrand\u00a0Hanson Limited\u00a0- Nominated & Financial Adviser\nJames Spinney\nJames Dance\nRob Patrick\nCavendish - Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited\u00a0- Joint Broker\nCallum Stewart\nSimon Mensley\nAshton Clanfield\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7600\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nNotes to Editors\nReabold\nReabold Resources plc\u00a0has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects.

In this regard, the Company identified, matured and sold the strategic Victory gas project to Shell U.K. Limited (\"Shell\") for \u00a332m (\u00a312.7m net to Reabold). Reabold's current focus is on its two key gas assets that have strong parallels with Victory, namely West Newton in the UK and Colle Santo in Italy,\nwhere the Company plans to apply the same successful strategy demonstrated with Victory.\nFollowing the receipt of the final tranche payment from Shell for the sale of Victory in January 2024, Reabold now holds \u00a39.1m net cash and is therefore financially well positioned to progress these key assets, as well as distributing excess cash to shareholders.\nWest Newton\nHighlights\nA proposed well (\"WN-A3\") planned to be drilled during 2024 will be twinned with the West Newton A-1 discovery well (\"WN-A1\") which was not tested\n\u00b7\nThe WN-A1 well is interpreted as having a 27 metre gas column within the Kirkham Abbey formation (\"KA Formation\"), indicated on well logs\n\u00b7\nThe WN-A3 well will be drilled as a directional, high angle well, offering significant cost savings compared with the previously planned horizontal well\n\u00b7\nAn additional material target in the deeper Permian Rotliegend Sandstone (\"Rotliegend\") will also be evaluated\n\u00b7\nFeasibility study underway for a single well development plan for possible development of WN-A3 well to follow successful testing and well completion\n\u00b7\nPlanning is already in place to drill and produce from the A Site and other approvals are being accelerated\n\u00b7\nRevised drilling plan is cost-effective with a high chance of success, offering a rapid early-stage development scenario\nDrilling of a first development well (WN-A3) at West Newton (56.3% economic interest net to Reabold), potentially one of the largest ever UK onshore gas discoveries, is planned for 2024, subject to the operator, Rathlin (UK) Energy Limited (\"Rathlin\"), securing sufficient funding to drill and test the well. There is an active process underway to assess options to source funding for Rathlin's share of the cost, including through a farmout, or through further investment from Reabold, which, following the receipt of the proceeds from Shell, the Company could potentially provide, in addition to funding its own share.\nDiscovery in the Kirkham Abbey Formation Principal Target\nThe WN-A1 well, drilled in 2013, is interpreted as having encountered 27 metres of potential gas pay at the top of the KA Formation. This figure was calculated from the Computer Petrophysical Interpretation (\"CPI\"), using electrical and mud logs over the interval.\nThe KA Formation was perforated and cleaned using 15% hydrochloric acid. After removal of the acidizing work-string and during preparation to run the production work-string, the well started to flow fluid and the blind rams were closed for safety reasons to establish control of the well.\nThe WN-A1 well was subsequently shut in and suspended in accordance with normal operational and safety procedures after numerous attempts to clean up were unsuccessful.\nThe conclusion drawn from these well operations was that due to the severe damage to the KA Formation, it was not possible to obtain a valid hydrocarbon production test to surface of the 27 metre pay-zone shown on the CPI log.\nDeeper Material Rotliegend Zone Secondary Target\nA re-evaluation of the downhole logs of the WN-A1 well by the Joint Venture's technical teams indicate a possible seven metre gas column in the Rotliegend, the main reservoir for the prolific UK Southern North Sea Gas Basin gas fields.\nThe gas is sourced from the underlying Westphalian and Namurian sediments and is trapped in structures sealed by the overlying Zechstein evaporites.\nPreliminary mapping of the base Zechstein at West Newton indicates low-relief structures as observed offshore.\nThe nearest offshore Rotliegend field is the depleted Amethyst complex centred on block 47/14a within the Southern North Sea Gas Basin, which contained 1.2 tcf of original gas in place, and produced approximately 795 bcf of gas and 5.4 mmbbl of condensate, from a series of low-relief structures trending South-East to North-West.\nWithin the UK onshore, the Caythorpe field, approximately 30 kilometres from West Newton produced 6.67 bcf of gas with associated condensate from the Rotliegend, displaying porosities up to 19% and permeability up to 500md, with gas also being produced from the overlying Zechstein.\nCalculations for the Rotliegend zone in the WN-A1 well indicat",

Yes I also looked at that scenario playing out in California as they were producing small amounts of gas and condensate alongside the oil. To be fair they did very well (no pun intended) in California every well they drilled was a producer and they did them in a matter of weeks and at only about $50k per well if they had managed to get the waste water well drilled before they were stopped they would have been producing it at $13-$14 dollars per barrel rather than the 36$ this will all be  accounted for in their damages and the lost production since they shut in the wells they had about ten on the go if I remember correctly and the oil prices were far higher than today, went up to a high of $120 per barrel for a short time. There will be a lot of compensation there at some of it will flow directly to RBD as it was before the merger with DBRM, it would be the icing on the cake if Rohan sets up over there to.

Stephen covers how Reabold has successfully executed this strategy in the past, including the Victory gas project, where a modest initial investment was ultimately sold to Shell for \u00a332 million. The team also explains its deliberate focus on European gas assets, highlighting the backdrop of declining indigenous supply alongside resilient demand across the region. The latter part of the discussion introduces West Newton, one of the largest onshore gas discoveries in the UK and Western Europe, with an estimated 200 bcf resource. Reabold sets out the investment case, the scale of the opportunity, and the range of exit options available, from a potential sale through to self-development, offering greater strategic optionality than previous projects.\" https://reabold.com/activity-updates/rvQage-business-overview",

Zoom out to the monthly chart and the view is about as good as things can get - breaking out from multiple year downtrend with high volume. Last weeks volume was most for 5 years and that is very impressive - more than just a pump and usually that signifies the beginning of a change in long-term trend. Happy to buy and hold!",

If it was to be a passive stake then, I am sure there are better situations around in which to invest. This is just my opinion which is capable of being as wrong as anyone else, but I can't see Rohan Oza just sitting there and doing nothing. The two CEO's are quite capable of doing that.

Stephen covers how Reabold has successfully executed this strategy in the past, including the Victory gas project, where a modest initial investment was ultimately sold to Shell for \u00a332 million. The team also explains its deliberate focus on European gas assets, highlighting the backdrop of declining indigenous supply alongside resilient demand across the region. The latter part of the discussion introduces West Newton, one of the largest onshore gas discoveries in the UK and Western Europe, with an estimated 200 bcf resource. Reabold sets out the investment case, the scale of the opportunity, and the range of exit options available, from a potential sale through to self-development, offering greater strategic optionality than previous projects.\" https://reabold.com/activity-updates/rvQage-business-overview",

My thesis is that Oza's buying in such a large amount will at least amount to attracting more interest from the US (where all the money is at right now) and with such a poultry market cap here, it doesn't take much to move things up by multiples! Zoom out to the monthly chart and the view is about as good as things can get - breaking out from multiple year downtrend with high volume. Last weeks volume was most for 5 years and that is very impressive - more than just a pump and usually that signifies the beginning of a change in long-term trend. Happy to buy and hold!",

I have very little confidence in the two CEO's who have achieved absolutely nothing in the last two years, so I should probably have sold before now. The current situation is, however, quite intriguing. Why would an apparently activist investor take a stake in a company like Reabold? If it was to be a passive stake then, I am sure there are better situations around in which to invest. This is just my opinion which is capable of being as wrong as anyone else, but I can't see Rohan Oza just sitting there and doing nothing. The two CEO's are quite capable of doing that. What I don't know is what form any action would take if anything happens. A passive investment in Reabold isn't going to enhance his reputation as a smart investor.",

In many areas, grid operators are telling Big Tech to plan their data centers together with a power source to serve the facility's electricity demand.",

SO we must use common sense.  Why invest in a \u00a312m CAP company unless you are serious?  Does he want to make money - Answer YES.  I am not interested in ramping.  But if I think that Rohan is a honest and genuine investor, if you agree then climb aboard and enjoy the ride. If you don't agree then don't invest.  I have filled my boots at this level to reduce my average buying price to 0.50p (no kidding) that is a fact.  YES, I got stung by not cashing in earlier but now I'm here to I hope enjoy the ride?

Odins I read through some of the old RNS'S on Cali  and double checked the figures with AI (I love this new AI stuff) and we should be due back a fair bit of compensation . Daily Production: During late 2021, prior to the acquisition of the entity by Daybreak Oil and Gas in October 2021, Reabold California's production was reported at approximately 70 barrels of oil per day. Assets: Reabold California operated 10 producing wells in the Sacramento Basin with proved reserves of 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Based on Reabold Resources' interim report for the period ending June 30, 2020, the estimated cash operating cost for their California assets was approximately US$14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). Key details regarding Reabold's California production costs (circa 2019-2020): Operating Costs: The company reported an operating cost of roughly $13-$14 per boe. Production Volume: In the first half of 2020, they produced 36,991 gross boe (18,496 net). Revenue & Pricing: During the same H1 2020 period, they generated US$38.1 per boe in revenue ($30.5 net of royalties). Impact of Shut-ins: Reports indicated that if a wastewater well had been successfully drilled before operational pauses, the production costs could have been sustained at lower levels, potentially around $13-$14 per barrel.",

To be fair they did very well (no pun intended) in California every well they drilled was a producer and they did them in a matter of weeks and at only about $50k per well if they had managed to get the waste water well drilled before they were stopped they would have been producing it at $13-$14 dollars per barrel rather than the 36$ this will all be  accounted for in their damages and the lost production since they shut in the wells they had about ten on the go if I remember correctly and the oil prices were far higher than today, went up to a high of $120 per barrel for a short time. There will be a lot of compensation there at some of it will flow directly to RBD as it was before the merger with DBRM, it would be the icing on the cake if Rohan sets up over there to.

Yes it is very \"Yes prime minister\" material  even that lunatic Trump thinks all our politicians of whatever ilk are barking and on that score I can't disagree and all of this makes it more satisfying for me as the two bumbling Clouseau's will beat the system mostly by luck and chance.

The Beacon fiasco also can not be far off resolving and the DBRM debacle has dragged on so long we will win as the politics in California have done a 100% uturn.

West Newton Development (PEDL183 - 16.665% interest) West Newton is situated onshore UK, north of the River Humber, encompassing the town of Beverley, East Yorkshire.  The licence area is within the western sector of the Southern Zechstein Basin. The West Newton drilling programmes have yielded substantial hydrocarbon discoveries within the Kirkham Abbey formation and an independent resource assessment by RPC indicates the presence of a contingent resource of 198 billion cubic feet of gas. The Company`s technical team has further identified targets within the licence area which indicate volumetrically significant prospective gas resources in an untested formation. The operator, Rathlin Energy (UK) Ltd (\"Rathlin\") has an ambitious work programme planned for this project during 2026, subject to receipt of regulatory consents. David Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack, commented: \"Union Jack holds numerous valuable assets on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The potential revenues from an expansion at Wressle and a development at West Newton are expected to be material to the Company.  I have no doubt that the current attitude towards fossil fuels will change for the better in the UK and it is a waiting game for the significant commercial and strategic costs of the energy transition to become evident compared to the many merits of maintaining and encouraging domestic oil and gas production.",

Odins I read through some of the old RNS'S on Cali  and double checked the figures with AI (I love this new AI stuff) and we should be due back a fair bit of compensation . Daily Production: During late 2021, prior to the acquisition of the entity by Daybreak Oil and Gas in October 2021, Reabold California's production was reported at approximately 70 barrels of oil per day. Assets: Reabold California operated 10 producing wells in the Sacramento Basin with proved reserves of 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Based on Reabold Resources' interim report for the period ending June 30, 2020, the estimated cash operating cost for their California assets was approximately US$14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). Key details regarding Reabold's California production costs (circa 2019-2020): Operating Costs: The company reported an operating cost of roughly $13-$14 per boe. Production Volume: In the first half of 2020, they produced 36,991 gross boe (18,496 net). Revenue & Pricing: During the same H1 2020 period, they generated US$38.1 per boe in revenue ($30.5 net of royalties). Impact of Shut-ins: Reports indicated that if a wastewater well had been successfully drilled before operational pauses, the production costs could have been sustained at lower levels, potentially around $13-$14 per barrel.",

To be fair they did very well (no pun intended) in California every well they drilled was a producer and they did them in a matter of weeks and at only about $50k per well if they had managed to get the waste water well drilled before they were stopped they would have been producing it at $13-$14 dollars per barrel rather than the 36$ this will all be  accounted for in their damages and the lost production since they shut in the wells they had about ten on the go if I remember correctly and the oil prices were far higher than today, went up to a high of $120 per barrel for a short time. There will be a lot of compensation there at some of it will flow directly to RBD as it was before the merger with DBRM, it would be the icing on the cake if Rohan sets up over there to.

The Beacon fiasco also can not be far off resolving and the DBRM debacle has dragged on so long we will win as the politics in California have done a 100% uturn.

Incredible how those men change the goal posts to fund their pockets. It doesnt even have planning in place an the other wells in the UK ( Most weird they dont mention West Newton on what I was researching) will all need proppanting. For a newbie you would wonder what we are batting on about. If this does pull off for you guys then very well done but I see it as VERY high risk.",

Now, considering you don't need a ton of barG to run a data centre.  This could well play out to be a very smart move. If oil and condensate happen to be a by product of the gas extraction, then RBD & UJO have played a blinder. They get what they wanted all along.  Just in a round about fashion.

The very sharp fall in gold and silver, although no directly related, seems to have spooked investors in the smaller stocks. Stephen Williams hasn't helped with his recent party political broadcast. He seems to think that their business model is working with just one completed transaction in eight years, and that one at a valuation well below what the market was expecting. It doesn't help that Colle Santo, which they describe as a good deal, just kicks the repayment can from Beacon well down the road, and without any certainty of getting the sort of return expected. Beacon itself should have completed part of the deal in November, but haven't yet produced the prospectus for the deal and attached fund raise. It doesn't seem such a great deal selling to a cash shell, with no other business, and having to fund part of the deal yourself, even if you get shares of unknown future value. The only bright spot is the recent purchase by Rohan Oza. I originally though that it might lead to something interesting, but that excitement has died down, and we will have to wait and see. If things have to rely on delivery by Stephen Williams and Sachin Oza, then we are all doomed.",

West Newton Development (PEDL183 - 16.665% interest) West Newton is situated onshore UK, north of the River Humber, encompassing the town of Beverley, East Yorkshire.  The licence area is within the western sector of the Southern Zechstein Basin. The West Newton drilling programmes have yielded substantial hydrocarbon discoveries within the Kirkham Abbey formation and an independent resource assessment by RPC indicates the presence of a contingent resource of 198 billion cubic feet of gas. The Company`s technical team has further identified targets within the licence area which indicate volumetrically significant prospective gas resources in an untested formation. The operator, Rathlin Energy (UK) Ltd (\"Rathlin\") has an ambitious work programme planned for this project during 2026, subject to receipt of regulatory consents. David Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack, commented: \"Union Jack holds numerous valuable assets on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The potential revenues from an expansion at Wressle and a development at West Newton are expected to be material to the Company.  I have no doubt that the current attitude towards fossil fuels will change for the better in the UK and it is a waiting game for the significant commercial and strategic costs of the energy transition to become evident compared to the many merits of maintaining and encouraging domestic oil and gas production.",

Odins I read through some of the old RNS'S on Cali  and double checked the figures with AI (I love this new AI stuff) and we should be due back a fair bit of compensation . Daily Production: During late 2021, prior to the acquisition of the entity by Daybreak Oil and Gas in October 2021, Reabold California's production was reported at approximately 70 barrels of oil per day. Assets: Reabold California operated 10 producing wells in the Sacramento Basin with proved reserves of 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Based on Reabold Resources' interim report for the period ending June 30, 2020, the estimated cash operating cost for their California assets was approximately US$14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). Key details regarding Reabold's California production costs (circa 2019-2020): Operating Costs: The company reported an operating cost of roughly $13-$14 per boe. Production Volume: In the first half of 2020, they produced 36,991 gross boe (18,496 net). Revenue & Pricing: During the same H1 2020 period, they generated US$38.1 per boe in revenue ($30.5 net of royalties). Impact of Shut-ins: Reports indicated that if a wastewater well had been successfully drilled before operational pauses, the production costs could have been sustained at lower levels, potentially around $13-$14 per barrel.",

To be fair they did very well (no pun intended) in California every well they drilled was a producer and they did them in a matter of weeks and at only about $50k per well if they had managed to get the waste water well drilled before they were stopped they would have been producing it at $13-$14 dollars per barrel rather than the 36$ this will all be  accounted for in their damages and the lost production since they shut in the wells they had about ten on the go if I remember correctly and the oil prices were far higher than today, went up to a high of $120 per barrel for a short time. There will be a lot of compensation there at some of it will flow directly to RBD as it was before the merger with DBRM, it would be the icing on the cake if Rohan sets up over there to.

On the other hand, DBRM and the upcoming compensation award is a bit of an interesting one. They have ex RBD wells capable of producing gas in California.  Where not only is there a shortage of crude oil, but also gas to power data centres. Makes you wonder if Rohan is looking at the whole package. Some of which is on his home turf.  Doesn't it.",

Here's my take on WN - the EA consultation ended 06.10.25 - imo a decision will be announced in Q1 2026 - the NSTA deadline for re-entering is 30.06.26 If the permit is refused the sp will collapse If the permit is granted, a legal challenge will be launched immediately - the sp will fall sharply as a Judicial Review will take many months - well past the NSTA deadline I suspect a placing will happen soon, probably before the decision. they need to refill the coffers if only to maintain the gravy train for a few more years Finally, simon's LSE post \"Don't forget the final C.S approval approx 16 million euro's heading our way over the next couple of years.\" is complete bollux, he clearly doesnt understand the mechanics of the deal ...beware the rampers, they will lose you money",

As oil fell out of fashion, a gas play was then suggested, (following core samples) but the well bore would need a good wash down and a propant squeeze to get the gas flowing at commercial rates. ..After the wrong drilling mud was used. Now, considering you don't need a ton of barG to run a data centre.  This could well play out to be a very smart move. If oil and condensate happen to be a by product of the gas extraction, then RBD & UJO have played a blinder. They get what they wanted all along.  Just in a round about fashion. Rohan Oza is not invested in a tiny company like RBD for the fun of it.  Something is in the offing.",

The very sharp fall in gold and silver, although no directly related, seems to have spooked investors in the smaller stocks. Stephen Williams hasn't helped with his recent party political broadcast. He seems to think that their business model is working with just one completed transaction in eight years, and that one at a valuation well below what the market was expecting. It doesn't help that Colle Santo, which they describe as a good deal, just kicks the repayment can from Beacon well down the road, and without any certainty of getting the sort of return expected. Beacon itself should have completed part of the deal in November, but haven't yet produced the prospectus for the deal and attached fund raise. It doesn't seem such a great deal selling to a cash shell, with no other business, and having to fund part of the deal yourself, even if you get shares of unknown future value. The only bright spot is the recent purchase by Rohan Oza. I originally though that it might lead to something interesting, but that excitement has died down, and we will have to wait and see. If things have to rely on delivery by Stephen Williams and Sachin Oza, then we are all doomed.",

West Newton Development (PEDL183 - 16.665% interest) West Newton is situated onshore UK, north of the River Humber, encompassing the town of Beverley, East Yorkshire.  The licence area is within the western sector of the Southern Zechstein Basin. The West Newton drilling programmes have yielded substantial hydrocarbon discoveries within the Kirkham Abbey formation and an independent resource assessment by RPC indicates the presence of a contingent resource of 198 billion cubic feet of gas. The Company`s technical team has further identified targets within the licence area which indicate volumetrically significant prospective gas resources in an untested formation. The operator, Rathlin Energy (UK) Ltd (\"Rathlin\") has an ambitious work programme planned for this project during 2026, subject to receipt of regulatory consents. David Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack, commented: \"Union Jack holds numerous valuable assets on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The potential revenues from an expansion at Wressle and a development at West Newton are expected to be material to the Company.  I have no doubt that the current attitude towards fossil fuels will change for the better in the UK and it is a waiting game for the significant commercial and strategic costs of the energy transition to become evident compared to the many merits of maintaining and encouraging domestic oil and gas production.",

Odins I read through some of the old RNS'S on Cali  and double checked the figures with AI (I love this new AI stuff) and we should be due back a fair bit of compensation . Daily Production: During late 2021, prior to the acquisition of the entity by Daybreak Oil and Gas in October 2021, Reabold California's production was reported at approximately 70 barrels of oil per day. Assets: Reabold California operated 10 producing wells in the Sacramento Basin with proved reserves of 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Based on Reabold Resources' interim report for the period ending June 30, 2020, the estimated cash operating cost for their California assets was approximately US$14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). Key details regarding Reabold's California production costs (circa 2019-2020): Operating Costs: The company reported an operating cost of roughly $13-$14 per boe. Production Volume: In the first half of 2020, they produced 36,991 gross boe (18,496 net). Revenue & Pricing: During the same H1 2020 period, they generated US$38.1 per boe in revenue ($30.5 net of royalties). Impact of Shut-ins: Reports indicated that if a wastewater well had been successfully drilled before operational pauses, the production costs could have been sustained at lower levels, potentially around $13-$14 per barrel.",

To be fair they did very well (no pun intended) in California every well they drilled was a producer and they did them in a matter of weeks and at only about $50k per well if they had managed to get the waste water well drilled before they were stopped they would have been producing it at $13-$14 dollars per barrel rather than the 36$ this will all be  accounted for in their damages and the lost production since they shut in the wells they had about ten on the go if I remember correctly and the oil prices were far higher than today, went up to a high of $120 per barrel for a short time. There will be a lot of compensation there at some of it will flow directly to RBD as it was before the merger with DBRM, it would be the icing on the cake if Rohan sets up over there to.

Incredible how those men change the goal posts to fund their pockets. It doesnt even have planning in place an the other wells in the UK ( Most weird they dont mention West Newton on what I was researching) will all need proppanting.

As oil fell out of fashion, a gas play was then suggested, (following core samples) but the well bore would need a good wash down and a propant squeeze to get the gas flowing at commercial rates. ..After the wrong drilling mud was used. Now, considering you don't need a ton of barG to run a data centre.  This could well play out to be a very smart move. If oil and condensate happen to be a by product of the gas extraction, then RBD & UJO have played a blinder. They get what they wanted all along.  Just in a round about fashion. Rohan Oza is not invested in a tiny company like RBD for the fun of it.  Something is in the offing.",

The very sharp fall in gold and silver, although no directly related, seems to have spooked investors in the smaller stocks. Stephen Williams hasn't helped with his recent party political broadcast. He seems to think that their business model is working with just one completed transaction in eight years, and that one at a valuation well below what the market was expecting. It doesn't help that Colle Santo, which they describe as a good deal, just kicks the repayment can from Beacon well down the road, and without any certainty of getting the sort of return expected. Beacon itself should have completed part of the deal in November, but haven't yet produced the prospectus for the deal and attached fund raise. It doesn't seem such a great deal selling to a cash shell, with no other business, and having to fund part of the deal yourself, even if you get shares of unknown future value. The only bright spot is the recent purchase by Rohan Oza. I originally though that it might lead to something interesting, but that excitement has died down, and we will have to wait and see. If things have to rely on delivery by Stephen Williams and Sachin Oza, then we are all doomed.",

West Newton Development (PEDL183 - 16.665% interest) West Newton is situated onshore UK, north of the River Humber, encompassing the town of Beverley, East Yorkshire.  The licence area is within the western sector of the Southern Zechstein Basin. The West Newton drilling programmes have yielded substantial hydrocarbon discoveries within the Kirkham Abbey formation and an independent resource assessment by RPC indicates the presence of a contingent resource of 198 billion cubic feet of gas. The Company`s technical team has further identified targets within the licence area which indicate volumetrically significant prospective gas resources in an untested formation. The operator, Rathlin Energy (UK) Ltd (\"Rathlin\") has an ambitious work programme planned for this project during 2026, subject to receipt of regulatory consents. David Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack, commented: \"Union Jack holds numerous valuable assets on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The potential revenues from an expansion at Wressle and a development at West Newton are expected to be material to the Company.  I have no doubt that the current attitude towards fossil fuels will change for the better in the UK and it is a waiting game for the significant commercial and strategic costs of the energy transition to become evident compared to the many merits of maintaining and encouraging domestic oil and gas production.",

Odins I read through some of the old RNS'S on Cali  and double checked the figures with AI (I love this new AI stuff) and we should be due back a fair bit of compensation . Daily Production: During late 2021, prior to the acquisition of the entity by Daybreak Oil and Gas in October 2021, Reabold California's production was reported at approximately 70 barrels of oil per day. Assets: Reabold California operated 10 producing wells in the Sacramento Basin with proved reserves of 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Based on Reabold Resources' interim report for the period ending June 30, 2020, the estimated cash operating cost for their California assets was approximately US$14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). Key details regarding Reabold's California production costs (circa 2019-2020): Operating Costs: The company reported an operating cost of roughly $13-$14 per boe. Production Volume: In the first half of 2020, they produced 36,991 gross boe (18,496 net). Revenue & Pricing: During the same H1 2020 period, they generated US$38.1 per boe in revenue ($30.5 net of royalties). Impact of Shut-ins: Reports indicated that if a wastewater well had been successfully drilled before operational pauses, the production costs could have been sustained at lower levels, potentially around $13-$14 per barrel.",

To be fair they did very well (no pun intended) in California every well they drilled was a producer and they did them in a matter of weeks and at only about $50k per well if they had managed to get the waste water well drilled before they were stopped they would have been producing it at $13-$14 dollars per barrel rather than the 36$ this will all be  accounted for in their damages and the lost production since they shut in the wells they had about ten on the go if I remember correctly and the oil prices were far higher than today, went up to a high of $120 per barrel for a short time. There will be a lot of compensation there at some of it will flow directly to RBD as it was before the merger with DBRM, it would be the icing on the cake if Rohan sets up over there to.

Incredible how those men change the goal posts to fund their pockets. It doesnt even have planning in place an the other wells in the UK ( Most weird they dont mention West Newton on what I was researching) will all need proppanting.

As oil fell out of fashion, a gas play was then suggested, (following core samples) but the well bore would need a good wash down and a propant squeeze to get the gas flowing at commercial rates. ..After the wrong drilling mud was used. Now, considering you don't need a ton of barG to run a data centre.  This could well play out to be a very smart move. If oil and condensate happen to be a by product of the gas extraction, then RBD & UJO have played a blinder. They get what they wanted all along.  Just in a round about fashion. Rohan Oza is not invested in a tiny company like RBD for the fun of it.  Something is in the offing.",

The very sharp fall in gold and silver, although no directly related, seems to have spooked investors in the smaller stocks. Stephen Williams hasn't helped with his recent party political broadcast. He seems to think that their business model is working with just one completed transaction in eight years, and that one at a valuation well below what the market was expecting. It doesn't help that Colle Santo, which they describe as a good deal, just kicks the repayment can from Beacon well down the road, and without any certainty of getting the sort of return expected. Beacon itself should have completed part of the deal in November, but haven't yet produced the prospectus for the deal and attached fund raise. It doesn't seem such a great deal selling to a cash shell, with no other business, and having to fund part of the deal yourself, even if you get shares of unknown future value. The only bright spot is the recent purchase by Rohan Oza. I originally though that it might lead to something interesting, but that excitement has died down, and we will have to wait and see. If things have to rely on delivery by Stephen Williams and Sachin Oza, then we are all doomed.",

West Newton Development (PEDL183 - 16.665% interest) West Newton is situated onshore UK, north of the River Humber, encompassing the town of Beverley, East Yorkshire.  The licence area is within the western sector of the Southern Zechstein Basin. The West Newton drilling programmes have yielded substantial hydrocarbon discoveries within the Kirkham Abbey formation and an independent resource assessment by RPC indicates the presence of a contingent resource of 198 billion cubic feet of gas. The Company`s technical team has further identified targets within the licence area which indicate volumetrically significant prospective gas resources in an untested formation. The operator, Rathlin Energy (UK) Ltd (\"Rathlin\") has an ambitious work programme planned for this project during 2026, subject to receipt of regulatory consents. David Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack, commented: \"Union Jack holds numerous valuable assets on both sides of the Atlantic. \"The potential revenues from an expansion at Wressle and a development at West Newton are expected to be material to the Company.  I have no doubt that the current attitude towards fossil fuels will change for the better in the UK and it is a waiting game for the significant commercial and strategic costs of the energy transition to become evident compared to the many merits of maintaining and encouraging domestic oil and gas production.",

Odins I read through some of the old RNS'S on Cali  and double checked the figures with AI (I love this new AI stuff) and we should be due back a fair bit of compensation . Daily Production: During late 2021, prior to the acquisition of the entity by Daybreak Oil and Gas in October 2021, Reabold California's production was reported at approximately 70 barrels of oil per day. Assets: Reabold California operated 10 producing wells in the Sacramento Basin with proved reserves of 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Based on Reabold Resources' interim report for the period ending June 30, 2020, the estimated cash operating cost for their California assets was approximately US$14.40 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). Key details regarding Reabold's California production costs (circa 2019-2020): Operating Costs: The company reported an operating cost of roughly $13-$14 per boe. Production Volume: In the first half of 2020, they produced 36,991 gross boe (18,496 net). Revenue & Pricing: During the same H1 2020 period, they generated US$38.1 per boe in revenue ($30.5 net of royalties). Impact of Shut-ins: Reports indicated that if a wastewater well had been successfully drilled before operational pauses, the production costs could have been sustained at lower levels, potentially around $13-$14 per barrel.",

To be fair they did very well (no pun intended) in California every well they drilled was a producer and they did them in a matter of weeks and at only about $50k per well if they had managed to get the waste water well drilled before they were stopped they would have been producing it at $13-$14 dollars per barrel rather than the 36$ this will all be  accounted for in their damages and the lost production since they shut in the wells they had about ten on the go if I remember correctly and the oil prices were far higher than today, went up to a high of $120 per barrel for a short time. There will be a lot of compensation there at some of it will flow directly to RBD as it was before the merger with DBRM, it would be the icing on the cake if Rohan sets up over there to.
