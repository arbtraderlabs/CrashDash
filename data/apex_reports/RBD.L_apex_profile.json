ADX holds the remaining 49.2% shareholding in Danube via its wholly owned subsidiary ADX Energy Panonia SRL (\"Panonia\"), and is the operator of Parta.\nPanonia has been unable to perform the work plan in Parta due to regulatory constraints, delays and operational access restrictions.\nADX was reluctant to enter into exploration phase 2, with additional significant commitments, due to the inability to perform the phase 1 program despite its reasonable efforts.\nAs a result ADX has been in discussions with the Romanian Regulatory Authorities regarding an extension of the Parta licence. Despite repeated requests,\nthe Regulatory Authority has advised that the exploration phase 1 of the licence has expired. Additionally, the Regulatory Authority has issued Panonia with invoices totalling EUR 4.2 million relating to alleged expenditures relating to the unperformed exploration commitments applicable to Parta.\nADX, on behalf of Panonia, will formally dispute these invoices\non the basis of having incurred significant costs to address the unforeseen challenges attributable to the work program, as well as due to the regulatory delays and access restrictions which have prevented Panonia from entirely fulfilling the work program, and denied Panonia the ability to benefit from the potential upside from making a discovery.\nFurther details can be found in the ADX Energy Ltd ASX release published on 24 October 2025 -\nhttps://investors.adx-energy.com/announcements/7225646\n.\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nCavendish - Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK version of the market abuse regulation (EU No. 596/2014) as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nNotes to Editors\nReabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects. Reabold's strategy is to invest in low-risk, near-term projects which it considers to have significant valuation uplift potential, with a clear monetisation plan, where receipt of such proceeds will be returned to shareholders and re-invested into further growth projects. This strategy is illustrated by the recent sale of the undeveloped Victory gas field to Shell, the proceeds of which are being returned to shareholders and re-invested.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Additionally, Reabold will receive new shares in Beacon, and will subscribe for additional shares as part of the Placing (as defined below), to take it's shareholding to approximately 29% of the enlarged capital of Beacon. The Proposed Transaction will complete in two phases, as detailed below.\nStephen Williams, Co-CEO of Reabold, commented:\n\"Through this transaction, Reabold has successfully crystalised value from the Colle Santo gas project, both through the Earn Out mechanism and the receipt of Beacon shares, whilst protecting Reabold shareholders from any further funding requirement, increased development costs or dilution in the asset. The Earn Out, which has a value of up to\n\u20ac\n16 million, offers Reabold and its shareholders a significant uplift in value from initial investment and ensures that Reabold shareholders will continue to benefit from the attractive cash flow generated from the project.\n\"In a similar way to the Victory project, which recently came onstream as an important supplier of indigenous gas to the UK, this is the Reabold strategy in action; unlocking strategic gas discoveries\nwhich have considerable valuation uplift potential by securing funding to bring projects to the next stage of development.\n\"We are pleased to partner with Beacon, which recognises the value of the Colle Santo project and its strategic importance in Italy\u00a0in securing national gas supply.\n\"As previously announced, a number of funding solutions are being progressed by LN Energy to enable the development of Colle Santo, including the prepay and offtake agreement with Gunvor, vendor financing agreements with Italfluid, and the potential for Italian government grants. With the positive regulatory decision announced last month, we are confident that the project will be brought into production with first gas in 2027.\"\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nEarn Out value of up to\n\u20ac16 million\n\u00b7\nAttractive cash flow stream:\nReabold will receive 25% of its pro rata share of cash flow from the Colle Santo project once on production, capped at\n\u20ac\n16 million\n\u00b7\nNear-term monetisation:\nActive work programme designed to achieve FID in mid-2026 and first gas in 2027\n\u00b7\nAdvanced financing plan\n: Additional financing options are in place with non-binding funding agreements with Italfluid for a vendor financing agreement and Gunvor through a prepay and offtake agreement; potential government grants are also being explored\nBeacon will be seeking to admit its shares to trading on AIM and to carry out a placing to new and existing investors (\"Placing\") to raise approximately \u00a33.5 million to finance the Colle Santo project through FID and towards first production,\u00a0as well as the associated required working capital. Reabold has agreed to support the Placing by participating with an investment of \u00a3750,000. The Directors of Beacon also intend to participate in the Placing.\nTransaction Structure\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, Beacon will acquire all of Reabold's interest in LNEnergy, which is currently 46.2%, in two phases.\nBeacon will initially acquire approximately 49\n%\nof Reabold's holding in LNEnergy (\"First Acquisition\"). The First Acquisition is anticipated to complete in November 2025 and\nis conditional upon, inter alia, the following:\n\u00b7\nBeacon and Reabold entering into a placing agreement as part of Beacon's Placing; and\n\u00b7\nBeacon successfully readmitting its shares to trading on AIM with the resolutions relating to the Proposed Transaction and to its readmission having been passed at Beacon's general meeting.\nThe First Acquisition long stop date is 4 months from the execution of the Agreement, which can be extended by mutual agreement between Reabold and Beacon.\nBeacon will subsequently acquire the balance of Reabold's holding in LNEnergy (\"Second Acquisition\").\nThe Second Acquisition is anticipated to complete in mid-2026 and is conditional upon, inter alia, the following:\n\u00b7\nGranting of the Colle Santo production concession; and\n\u00b7\nGranting of approval by the relevant Italian ministry, if required, in relation to the indirect change in control of LN Energy S.r.l. (LNEnergy's 100% owned Italian subsidiary with rights to the Colle Santo concession) resulting from the Second Acquisition.\nThe Second Acquisition long stop date is 12 months from the execution of the Agreement, which can be extended by mutual agreement between Reabold and Beacon.\nUpon completion of the Second Acquisition, Beacon, as the largest shareholder in LN Energy, intends to make funding available to the company to finance the Colle Santo project, with such funding anticipated to be provided through future subscriptions by Beacon for new shares in LNEnergy.\nConsideration\nReabold will receive contingent consideration, in the form of the Earn-Out, based on the future\nnet cash flow\nof LNEnergy. The Earn-Out is calculated as 25\n%\nof Reabold's pro-rata share of net cash flow from Colle Santo, subject to a cap of approximately \u20ac16 million.\nIn addition, under the terms of the SPA, Reabold will receive new shares in Beacon equal to approximately 29\n%\nof the enlarged share capital of the Company. Of the approximate 29\n%\n, approximately 14\n%\nrelates to Consideration Shares and 15\n%\nrelates to Reabold's participation in the Placing.\nThe Consideration Shares held by Reabold on admission to AIM will be subject to\u00a0both lock-in terms and a relationship agreement, full details of which will be set out in the Beacon's Admission Document.\nFor further information, contact:\nReabold Resources plc\nSachin Oza\nStephen Williams\nc/o Camarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nCavendish - Nominated & Financial Adviser and Broker\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nSam Morris\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nNotes to Editors\nReabold Resources\nReabold Resources plc has a diversified portfolio of exploration, appraisal and development oil & gas projects.
