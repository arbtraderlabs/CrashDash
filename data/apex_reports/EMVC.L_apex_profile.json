A business update on Sofant also follows.\nFundraising\nThis is a seminal funding round for Sofant, as the company transitions from multi-year R&D into a commercial launch and production.\nThe Fundraising was led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (\nEMVCP\n), the Group's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. EMVCP played a central role in structuring the round, anchoring it with c.\u00a30.75 million of new equity investment, managing loan conversions and aligning all major stakeholders. The round includes significant participation by Scottish Enterprise, the National Security Strategic Investment Fund and other investors. The Fundraising comprises of c.\u00a31.1 million of new equity investment together with the conversion of approximately \u00a34.7 million of existing loans and accrued interest under convertible loan agreements and approximately \u00a3430,000 of advance subscriptions. As part of the transaction, a portion of fees owed to EMVCP were converted into equity, further increasing the Group's direct stake.\nProceeds from the Fundraising will support the scaling of Sofant's operations, final qualification of its first commercial products, and preparation for early customer deployments in satellite communications, defence and advanced wireless markets.\nFollowing completion of the Fundraising, the Group's fully diluted equity holding in Sofant is 1.2 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a30.6 million. This represents a c.9.3 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Sofant by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Sofant will represent 27.0 per cent. of the fully diluted share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a313.0 million. This represents a c.10.5 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a311.8 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nThe Fundraising follows a period of strong technical and commercial momentum for Sofant. In October 2025, the company achieved a major industry breakthrough by successfully demonstrating the world's first fully functioning Ka-band transmit array using its proprietary RF MEMS beamforming IC. This milestone showcased Sofant's ability to achieve the integration of its proprietary technology into a complete transmit array, significantly reducing power consumption, size and thermal demands compared with traditional semiconductor-based systems.\nSupported by programmes with the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency, Sofant has advanced the development of its next-generation satellite communication terminal, designed to provide users with high-speed, low-latency satellite connectivity. The technology eliminates the need for complex cooling systems which is a key barrier to scaling modern SatCom and defence platforms.\nTo support the transition to a scale-up company, Sofant recently appointed Will Whitehorn OBE as Chair, who brings extensive experience in aerospace, satellite communications and commercial scaling. His appointment reflects the company's shift toward international expansion.\nDavid Wither, CEO of Sofant Technologies, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have secured this significant investment from our existing shareholder base, and to welcome NSSIF as a new strategic shareholder. This support is a testament to the disruptive potential of Sofant's technology and the remarkable progress our team has made in recent months. With this additional capital, we are positioned to accelerate our commercial deployment and redefine what is possible in wireless communications.\n\"EMVC has supported Sofant through several phases of development, and we would like to thank them for leading this round and for their continued support and guidance, along with our wider shareholder base.\"\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Sofant Investor Director, added:\n\"EMV Capital's anchoring of this pivotal funding round reflects our continued confidence in Sofant's breakthrough low-power RF MEMS technology, which we believe represents a step-change in the architecture of next-generation wireless systems, with the potential to reshape products across defence, aerospace, satellite communications and high-performance enterprise markets.\n\"This investment fits closely with our investment thesis of providing decisive hands-on support at key value inflection points of our portfolio companies, and to help attract strategic finance.\n\"We look forward to working closely with the Sofant team as they scale into global markets and unlock the significant value we believe this technology can create.\"\n-Ends-\nFor more information, please contact:\nEMV Capital plc\nvia Rosewood\nIlian Iliev, CEO\nPanmure Liberum (UK) Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Freddy Crossley / Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\nRosewood\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West /\nLlewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nAbout EMV Capital plc (EMVC)\nEMV Capital plc, is a deep tech and life sciences venture capital investment group with an international portfolio of high-growth companies.\nWith a strategic focus on generating superior returns for investors from the fast-growing sectors and technologies that will define our future; EMV Capital invests in, manages and strengthens early-stage IP-rich companies.\nEMV Capital holds both direct equity stakes and carried interest in its portfolio companies, creating an evergreen structure that supports extensive growth and value creation.

The additional capital will ensure Wanda can maintain its rapid execution pace while meeting rising demand for better chronic disease management and sustainable alternatives to rising drug costs in the US healthcare market.\nFollowing the completion of the Fundraising, the Group's total equity holding in Wanda is 16.5 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.7 million. This represents a c.15 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Wanda by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Wanda is 29.6 per cent. of Wanda's share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c. \u00a33.1 million. This represents a c.43 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a32.1 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nCommercial momentum\nDuring 2025 Wanda experienced a period of significant commercial progress, driven by rising interest from US health plans, employers and PBMs, who are seeking sustainable approaches to managing cardiometabolic disease and GLP-1 medication use. Over the past year, the company has launched its GLP-1 weight-management programme, released its enhanced cardiometabolic mobile app, and deployed its new Insights Engine, which is an analytics and AI layer that transforms all platform, device and coaching data into clear, actionable insights.\nThe company has out-competed several billion-dollar competitors to win multi-million-dollar contracts, has achieved consistent double-digit month on month growth, and expects to exceed $5 million ARR by the end of 2026.\nWanda's CEO, Tom Smith, presented a detailed update on the company's commercial traction and 2026 outlook at EMV Capital's\nMeet the Portfolio\nevent. The full presentation and investor Q&A can be accessed at:\nhttps://emvcapital.com/news/media/\nMarket Outlook\nWanda operates in one of the largest and fastest-growing healthcare markets globally. Chronic conditions account for 90% of total US healthcare spend, and GLP-1 drugs have become the fastest-growing category in the market, now averaging more than $10,000 per member per year. These sectors represent multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the US alone, and the global Remote Patient Monitoring market is forecast to reach around $110.7 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 19.8% from 2025 to 2033\u00b9. With increasing demand and a platform designed for scale, Wanda is well positioned to capture long-term value in this rapidly expanding sector.\n[1 Grand View Research, \"Remote Patient Monitoring System Market Report,\" 2024.]\nAppointment of New Chair\nTo support its next stage of growth, Wanda recently appointed Michael Steel as Chair. Michael brings a unique combination of operational leadership, board experience, and healthcare scale-up expertise. He founded Greenbrook Healthcare, a respected provider of urgent care services to the NHS and grew it into a \u00a340m+ revenue organisation employing more than 700 staff.\nAs Chair, Michael will work closely with the leadership team to advance commercial execution, accelerate strategic partnerships, and support the rollout of Wanda's platform.\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Wanda Investment Director, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to see Wanda complete this fundraise at a time when demand for sustainable virtual-care solutions is rising sharply across the US healthcare market. Over the past year, Wanda has demonstrated strong commercial traction, a clear value proposition for payers, and the ability to compete successfully against major market leaders. We look forward to supporting Wanda through EMV Capital's Venture Build programme as it continues building scale and delivering meaningful value to healthcare systems and patients in the US and beyond.\"\n-Ends-\nFor more information, please contact:\nEMV Capital plc\nvia Rosewood\nIlian Iliev, CEO\nPanmure Liberum (UK) Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Freddy Crossley / Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\nRosewood\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West /\nLlewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nAbout EMV Capital plc (EMVC)\nEMV Capital plc, is a deep tech and life sciences venture capital investment group with an international portfolio of high-growth companies.\nWith a strategic focus on generating superior returns for investors from the fast-growing sectors and technologies that will define our future; EMV Capital invests in, manages and strengthens early-stage IP-rich companies.\nEMV Capital holds both direct equity stakes and carried interest in its portfolio companies, creating an evergreen structure that supports extensive growth and value creation.
