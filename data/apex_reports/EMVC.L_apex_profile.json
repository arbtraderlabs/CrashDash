It assumes all portfolio companies are treated as investments rather than as subsidiaries and therefore excludes portfolio company operating revenues while including fundraising and other fees charged by EMV Capital core. EMV Capital core\ncomprises EMV Capital plc, EMV Capital Partners Limited and other EMV Capital operating companies in the Group.\nOutlook\nEMV Capital continues to see high-quality opportunities across its portfolio and pipeline despite market conditions for venture capital and exits remaining challenging. Structural tailwinds across deep tech, life sciences and sustainability, including healthcare demand, defence and security priorities, and industrial and supply-chain realignment all continue to strengthen. Whilst no major exits occurred during the period, several portfolio companies have been and continue to be engaged in potential M&A and other strategic partnership discussions, evidencing a greater market appetite for corporate transactional activities and growth.\nThe Group remains focused on disciplined capital deployment, proactive portfolio management and the continued scaling of its Funds and Venture Building platforms. The Board believes EMV Capital is well positioned to navigate ongoing market uncertainty and to benefit from a recovery in capital markets as sentiment improves.\nKey Portfolio Highlights2\nDuring 2025, a number of portfolio companies made strong strategic, commercial and technical progress, advancing towards key value inflection points despite a selective funding environment. Selected highlights include:\nNote (2): Portfolio holdings and fair values below are stated on a fully diluted basis (including share options and warrants but excluding convertible loans).\nWanda Health\nOperates in the rapidly expanding US Remote Patient Monitoring market, forecast to reach c.US$110.7 billion by 2033 (CAGR 19.8% from 2025-2033).Secured multi-million-dollar contracts in the US, out-competing larger industry players and delivering consistent double-digit month-on-month revenue growth.Completed a \u00a30.86 million fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners, to support continued commercial expansion.\nEMV Capital holds a 16.5% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a31.7 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 30.2% interest (valued at c.\u00a33.5 million (unaudited)).\nEpiBone\nUS-\nbased\nclinical-stage regenerative medicine specialist focused on skeletal reconstruction.\nCompleted a US$4 million fundraising in 2025, in which EMV Capital Partners played a lead role in syndicating a US$0.75 million co-investment, significantly increasing its direct and indirect stakes in the company and gaining a board observer seat.The proceeds of the funding are to be deployed to accelerate clinical development of its key products and further corporate development.\nEMV Capital holds a 1.7% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a31.3 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 5.3% interest (valued at c.\u00a34.2 million (unaudited)).\nAMR Bio\nNew addition to the Venture Building programme, formed following the acquisition in September 2025 of key intellectual property and clinical assets relating to the XF-73 drug platform from Destiny Pharma Limited, an ex-AIM quoted biotechnology company.AMR Bio, was created to develop the assets and plan a route to commercialisation, with a focus on preparing the company for a Phase 3 clinical trial.The transaction was structured with \u00a3475,000 upfront cash consideration and deferred milestone-linked payments, while introducing third-party capital through EMV Capital Partners and establishing a new venture within the portfolio.\nEMV Capital holds a 30.0% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a30.6 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 70.0% interest (valued at c.\u00a31.3 million (unaudited)).\nDeeptech Recycling Technologies\nProprietary, patented chemical recycling technology converting hard-to-recycle plastic waste into synthetic oil and wax products (Plaxx\u00ae).Strong pipeline of commercial projects progressing toward execution, including a 9,000 tpa plant in Norway supported by c.\u00a311 million of Norwegian government debt financing programme (to be provided subject to matched-funding, which it is anticipated will be provided by project counterparties).Completed a c.\u00a31.22 million equity fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners, to support commercial deployment.\nEMV Capital holds a 18.0% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a32.8 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 29.7% interest (valued at c.\u00a34.7 million (unaudited)).\nSofant Technologies\nAchieved a major industry milestone in October 2025 with the successful demonstration of the world's first fully functioning Ka-band transmit array using proprietary RF MEMS beamforming technology.Supported by programmes with the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency, advancing toward commercial launch.Completed a c.\u00a36.25 million equity fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital, Partners, as the company transitions from R&D into early production and commercial sales.\nEMV Capital holds a 1.1% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a30.5 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 24.1% interest (valued at c.\u00a312.5 million (unaudited)).\nQ-Bot\nUK-based robotics and AI company that provides robotic underfloor insulation and building surveying technologies.Completed a c.\u00a31.1 million fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners, to support Q-Bot's growth strategy, following its recent transition to a lean technology business.\nEMV Capital holds a 27.1% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a31.4 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 53.0% interest (valued at c.\u00a33.5 million (unaudited)).\nMartlet Capital\nDuring the year, EMV Capital completed the full operational integration of Martlet Capital Management into the Group. The Martlet portfolio demonstrated resilience and fair value progression, supported by selective follow-on investments and an initial secondary exit that delivered proceeds of approximately \u00a3320k and a 2.5x return. The integration has strengthened the Group's Funds practice and expanded its opportunity set for recurring management fees, carried interest and third-party AUM growth.\nIn line with Group strategy, EMV Capital's EIS practice has co-invested in Martlet portfolio companies, Xampla (bioplastics) and OctaiPipe (AI datacentre software), and intends to increase its co-investments within the Martlet portfolio. This will deepen the fund's presence in the Cambridge cluster, provide investors with greater diversity, and increase sources of carried interest available to the Group.\nCommenting on the update, Dr Ilian Iliev, Chief Executive Officer of EMV Capital plc, said:\n\"EMV Capital has continued to make steady progress during 2025. We have maintained AUM above \u00a3100 million, completed the integration of Martlet Capital, advanced our Venture Building programme and supported a number of existing and new portfolio companies through important funding and commercial milestones.\n\"Our focus remains on capital efficiency, active portfolio management and building a resilient platform that can deliver long-term value for shareholders. Our operational 'core' income growth is demonstrating the potential of our differentiated strategy to deliver revenue growth even in the absence of liquidity events. Whilst we remain cautious in the near term, we believe the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our operating model position the Group well for further growth as market conditions normalise, and the M&A market improves.\"\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Ed Hooper, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Company.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE UK VERSION OF REGULATION (EU) NO 596/2014 WHICH IS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED.

As part of the transaction, a portion of fees owed to EMVCP were converted into equity, further increasing the Group's direct stake.\nProceeds from the Fundraising will support the scaling of Sofant's operations, final qualification of its first commercial products, and preparation for early customer deployments in satellite communications, defence and advanced wireless markets.\nFollowing completion of the Fundraising, the Group's fully diluted equity holding in Sofant is 1.2 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a30.6 million. This represents a c.9.3 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Sofant by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Sofant will represent 27.0 per cent. of the fully diluted share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a313.0 million. This represents a c.10.5 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a311.8 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nThe Fundraising follows a period of strong technical and commercial momentum for Sofant. In October 2025, the company achieved a major industry breakthrough by successfully demonstrating the world's first fully functioning Ka-band transmit array using its proprietary RF MEMS beamforming IC. This milestone showcased Sofant's ability to achieve the integration of its proprietary technology into a complete transmit array, significantly reducing power consumption, size and thermal demands compared with traditional semiconductor-based systems.\nSupported by programmes with the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency, Sofant has advanced the development of its next-generation satellite communication terminal, designed to provide users with high-speed, low-latency satellite connectivity. The technology eliminates the need for complex cooling systems which is a key barrier to scaling modern SatCom and defence platforms.\nTo support the transition to a scale-up company, Sofant recently appointed Will Whitehorn OBE as Chair, who brings extensive experience in aerospace, satellite communications and commercial scaling. His appointment reflects the company's shift toward international expansion.\nDavid Wither, CEO of Sofant Technologies, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have secured this significant investment from our existing shareholder base, and to welcome NSSIF as a new strategic shareholder. This support is a testament to the disruptive potential of Sofant's technology and the remarkable progress our team has made in recent months. With this additional capital, we are positioned to accelerate our commercial deployment and redefine what is possible in wireless communications.\n\"EMVC has supported Sofant through several phases of development, and we would like to thank them for leading this round and for their continued support and guidance, along with our wider shareholder base.\"\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Sofant Investor Director, added:\n\"EMV Capital's anchoring of this pivotal funding round reflects our continued confidence in Sofant's breakthrough low-power RF MEMS technology, which we believe represents a step-change in the architecture of next-generation wireless systems, with the potential to reshape products across defence, aerospace, satellite communications and high-performance enterprise markets.\n\"This investment fits closely with our investment thesis of providing decisive hands-on support at key value inflection points of our portfolio companies, and to help attract strategic finance.\n\"We look forward to working closely with the Sofant team as they scale into global markets and unlock the significant value we believe this technology can create.\"\n-Ends-\nFor more information, please contact:\nEMV Capital plc\nvia Rosewood\nIlian Iliev, CEO\nPanmure Liberum (UK) Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Freddy Crossley / Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\nRosewood\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West /\nLlewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nAbout EMV Capital plc (EMVC)\nEMV Capital plc, is a deep tech and life sciences venture capital investment group with an international portfolio of high-growth companies.\nWith a strategic focus on generating superior returns for investors from the fast-growing sectors and technologies that will define our future; EMV Capital invests in, manages and strengthens early-stage IP-rich companies.\nEMV Capital holds both direct equity stakes and carried interest in its portfolio companies, creating an evergreen structure that supports extensive growth and value creation.

A business update on Wanda also follows.\nFundraising\nThe Fundraising was led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (\nEMVCP\n), the Group's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. Wanda also is supported through EMV Capital's Venture Build programme.\nThe Fundraising includes \u00a30.60 million of equity investment and \u00a30.26 million through a loan facility. In addition, warrants have been exercised over shares worth \u00a30.60 million. The proceeds from the Fundraising will be used to accelerate Wanda's scale-up of operations with key customers in the US, further product development, and further execution of its commercial strategy. The additional capital will ensure Wanda can maintain its rapid execution pace while meeting rising demand for better chronic disease management and sustainable alternatives to rising drug costs in the US healthcare market.\nFollowing the completion of the Fundraising, the Group's total equity holding in Wanda is 16.5 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.7 million. This represents a c.15 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Wanda by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Wanda is 29.6 per cent. of Wanda's share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c. \u00a33.1 million. This represents a c.43 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a32.1 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nCommercial momentum\nDuring 2025 Wanda experienced a period of significant commercial progress, driven by rising interest from US health plans, employers and PBMs, who are seeking sustainable approaches to managing cardiometabolic disease and GLP-1 medication use. Over the past year, the company has launched its GLP-1 weight-management programme, released its enhanced cardiometabolic mobile app, and deployed its new Insights Engine, which is an analytics and AI layer that transforms all platform, device and coaching data into clear, actionable insights.\nThe company has out-competed several billion-dollar competitors to win multi-million-dollar contracts, has achieved consistent double-digit month on month growth, and expects to exceed $5 million ARR by the end of 2026.\nWanda's CEO, Tom Smith, presented a detailed update on the company's commercial traction and 2026 outlook at EMV Capital's\nMeet the Portfolio\nevent. The full presentation and investor Q&A can be accessed at:\nhttps://emvcapital.com/news/media/\nMarket Outlook\nWanda operates in one of the largest and fastest-growing healthcare markets globally. Chronic conditions account for 90% of total US healthcare spend, and GLP-1 drugs have become the fastest-growing category in the market, now averaging more than $10,000 per member per year. These sectors represent multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the US alone, and the global Remote Patient Monitoring market is forecast to reach around $110.7 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 19.8% from 2025 to 2033\u00b9. With increasing demand and a platform designed for scale, Wanda is well positioned to capture long-term value in this rapidly expanding sector.\n[1 Grand View Research, \"Remote Patient Monitoring System Market Report,\" 2024.]\nAppointment of New Chair\nTo support its next stage of growth, Wanda recently appointed Michael Steel as Chair. Michael brings a unique combination of operational leadership, board experience, and healthcare scale-up expertise. He founded Greenbrook Healthcare, a respected provider of urgent care services to the NHS and grew it into a \u00a340m+ revenue organisation employing more than 700 staff.\nAs Chair, Michael will work closely with the leadership team to advance commercial execution, accelerate strategic partnerships, and support the rollout of Wanda's platform.\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Wanda Investment Director, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to see Wanda complete this fundraise at a time when demand for sustainable virtual-care solutions is rising sharply across the US healthcare market. Over the past year, Wanda has demonstrated strong commercial traction, a clear value proposition for payers, and the ability to compete successfully against major market leaders. We look forward to supporting Wanda through EMV Capital's Venture Build programme as it continues building scale and delivering meaningful value to healthcare systems and patients in the US and beyond.\"\n-Ends-\nFor more information, please contact:\nEMV Capital plc\nvia Rosewood\nIlian Iliev, CEO\nPanmure Liberum (UK) Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Freddy Crossley / Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\nRosewood\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West /\nLlewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nAbout EMV Capital plc (EMVC)\nEMV Capital plc, is a deep tech and life sciences venture capital investment group with an international portfolio of high-growth companies.\nWith a strategic focus on generating superior returns for investors from the fast-growing sectors and technologies that will define our future; EMV Capital invests in, manages and strengthens early-stage IP-rich companies.\nEMV Capital holds both direct equity stakes and carried interest in its portfolio companies, creating an evergreen structure that supports extensive growth and value creation.

As part of the transaction, a portion of fees owed to EMVCP were converted into equity, further increasing the Group's direct stake.\nProceeds from the Fundraising will support the scaling of Sofant's operations, final qualification of its first commercial products, and preparation for early customer deployments in satellite communications, defence and advanced wireless markets.\nFollowing completion of the Fundraising, the Group's fully diluted equity holding in Sofant is 1.2 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a30.6 million. This represents a c.9.3 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Sofant by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Sofant will represent 27.0 per cent. of the fully diluted share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a313.0 million. This represents a c.10.5 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a311.8 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nThe Fundraising follows a period of strong technical and commercial momentum for Sofant. In October 2025, the company achieved a major industry breakthrough by successfully demonstrating the world's first fully functioning Ka-band transmit array using its proprietary RF MEMS beamforming IC. This milestone showcased Sofant's ability to achieve the integration of its proprietary technology into a complete transmit array, significantly reducing power consumption, size and thermal demands compared with traditional semiconductor-based systems.\nSupported by programmes with the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency, Sofant has advanced the development of its next-generation satellite communication terminal, designed to provide users with high-speed, low-latency satellite connectivity. The technology eliminates the need for complex cooling systems which is a key barrier to scaling modern SatCom and defence platforms.\nTo support the transition to a scale-up company, Sofant recently appointed Will Whitehorn OBE as Chair, who brings extensive experience in aerospace, satellite communications and commercial scaling. His appointment reflects the company's shift toward international expansion.\nDavid Wither, CEO of Sofant Technologies, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have secured this significant investment from our existing shareholder base, and to welcome NSSIF as a new strategic shareholder.

A business update on Wanda also follows.\nFundraising\nThe Fundraising was led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (\nEMVCP\n), the Group's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. Wanda also is supported through EMV Capital's Venture Build programme.\nThe Fundraising includes \u00a30.60 million of equity investment and \u00a30.26 million through a loan facility. In addition, warrants have been exercised over shares worth \u00a30.60 million. The proceeds from the Fundraising will be used to accelerate Wanda's scale-up of operations with key customers in the US, further product development, and further execution of its commercial strategy. The additional capital will ensure Wanda can maintain its rapid execution pace while meeting rising demand for better chronic disease management and sustainable alternatives to rising drug costs in the US healthcare market.\nFollowing the completion of the Fundraising, the Group's total equity holding in Wanda is 16.5 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.7 million. This represents a c.15 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Wanda by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Wanda is 29.6 per cent. of Wanda's share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c. \u00a33.1 million. This represents a c.43 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a32.1 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nCommercial momentum\nDuring 2025 Wanda experienced a period of significant commercial progress, driven by rising interest from US health plans, employers and PBMs, who are seeking sustainable approaches to managing cardiometabolic disease and GLP-1 medication use. Over the past year, the company has launched its GLP-1 weight-management programme, released its enhanced cardiometabolic mobile app, and deployed its new Insights Engine, which is an analytics and AI layer that transforms all platform, device and coaching data into clear, actionable insights.\nThe company has out-competed several billion-dollar competitors to win multi-million-dollar contracts, has achieved consistent double-digit month on month growth, and expects to exceed $5 million ARR by the end of 2026.\nWanda's CEO, Tom Smith, presented a detailed update on the company's commercial traction and 2026 outlook at EMV Capital's\nMeet the Portfolio\nevent. The full presentation and investor Q&A can be accessed at:\nhttps://emvcapital.com/news/media/\nMarket Outlook\nWanda operates in one of the largest and fastest-growing healthcare markets globally. Chronic conditions account for 90% of total US healthcare spend, and GLP-1 drugs have become the fastest-growing category in the market, now averaging more than $10,000 per member per year. These sectors represent multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the US alone, and the global Remote Patient Monitoring market is forecast to reach around $110.7 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 19.8% from 2025 to 2033\u00b9. With increasing demand and a platform designed for scale, Wanda is well positioned to capture long-term value in this rapidly expanding sector.\n[1 Grand View Research, \"Remote Patient Monitoring System Market Report,\" 2024.]\nAppointment of New Chair\nTo support its next stage of growth, Wanda recently appointed Michael Steel as Chair. Michael brings a unique combination of operational leadership, board experience, and healthcare scale-up expertise. He founded Greenbrook Healthcare, a respected provider of urgent care services to the NHS and grew it into a \u00a340m+ revenue organisation employing more than 700 staff.\nAs Chair, Michael will work closely with the leadership team to advance commercial execution, accelerate strategic partnerships, and support the rollout of Wanda's platform.\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Wanda Investment Director, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to see Wanda complete this fundraise at a time when demand for sustainable virtual-care solutions is rising sharply across the US healthcare market. Over the past year, Wanda has demonstrated strong commercial traction, a clear value proposition for payers, and the ability to compete successfully against major market leaders. We l",

Both changes are expected to take effect from 1 December 2025.\nThe creation of these two distinct roles reflects EMVC's development into a business with over \u00a3100 million of Assets Under Management (AUM) and a portfolio of more than seventy companies, supported by multiple revenue streams across corporate finance, fund management, and value-creation services. As the Group has scaled, the scope of the finance function has naturally evolved, requiring a dedicated Group-focused CFO and a separate senior role focused exclusively on supporting portfolio company growth.\nAnesh Patel is an accomplished strategic finance leader with over twenty years of relevant experience. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Ernst & Young and his subsequent experience in investment banking and leadership roles within AIM-quoted life sciences companies closely align with EMVC's core areas of corporate finance, M&A projects, portfolio management and venture development.\nStephen, who has been with the Company for over seven years, will support an orderly handover before concentrating full-time on providing senior financial and accounting services to selected EMVC portfolio companies (paid for by the portfolio companies), ensuring continuity and strengthening of the Group's active portfolio-management model.\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital, commented:\n\"As the Group continues to grow, we are expanding our senior finance leadership. Stephen has been instrumental in helping build EMVC to where it is today, and I am delighted that he will continue to support our portfolio companies in a dedicated capacity. His move into the Portfolio CFO role allows us to deploy his strengths even more directly into supporting our portfolio.\n\"We are equally pleased to welcome Anesh to EMVC. His blend of financial leadership, capital-markets experience and sector expertise makes him exceptionally well aligned to our next phase of growth. He joins the Group at an important time as we continue to build scale across the organisation and drive towards break-even within our core operations.\"\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Ed Hooper, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Company.\n-ends-\nFor more information, please contact:\nEMV Capital plc\nvia Rosewood\nIlian Iliev, CEO\nPanmure Liberum Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Freddy Crossley / Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\nRosewood\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West /\u00a0Llewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nAbout EMV Capital plc (EMVC)\nEMV Capital plc is a deep tech and life sciences venture capital investment group with an international portfolio of high-growth companies.\nWith a strategic focus on generating superior returns for investors from the fast-growing sectors and technologies that will define our future; EMV Capital invests in, manages and strengthens early-stage IP-rich companies.\nEMV Capital holds both direct equity stakes and carried interest in its portfolio companies, creating an evergreen structure that supports extensive growth and value creation.

The consideration, payable by Bidco, for the acquisition includes an initial cash payment of \u00a3475,000 (plus VAT) (\nInitial Consideration\n) and deferred consideration of up to \u00a32 million (plus VAT) (\nDeferred Consideration\n). The Deferred Consideration comprises: (i) \u00a3600,000 payable upon Bidco in the future launching a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Phase 3 clinical trial in respect of XF-73; (ii) a further \u00a3900,000 upon Bidco's receipt of US regulatory approval for the commercial distribution, sale or marketing of the resulting XF-73 product; and up to a further \u00a3500,000 upon Bidco's receipt of a potential one-off milestone fee relating to net sales due under a regional development and commercialisation agreement with the investment arm of a large pharmaceutical company headquartered in Hong Kong.\nFunding of the Initial Consideration, Deferred Consideration and Bidco working capital\nThe Initial Consideration has been funded by third party funding, syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited, the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. Such funding has been provided in the form of a three year term loan with 100 per cent. warrant coverage (\nWarrants\n).\nPrior to any launch of a Phase 3 clinical trial or securing US regulatory approval, Bidco intends to carry out further fundraising activity, including raising sufficient funding as may be required in connection with such milestone activities and also the relevant elements of the Deferred Consideration referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above. The Deferred Consideration described in paragraph (iii) above would be settled from a larger amount of any milestone fee received by Bidco. As such, Bidco intends that it will in all cases be in a position to fund the Deferred Consideration prior to it falling due.\nEMV Capital Partners has also led an equity fundraising round for Bidco to raise up to a further \u00a3725,000 (\nEquity Fundraising\n) for the purposes of Bidco's working capital requirements. The Equity Fundraising is anticipated to complete within September 2025 following some post-acquisition structuring to allow for Bidco to attract Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) investors.\nFollowing completion of the Equity Fundraising (assuming raising a full \u00a3725,000) c.\u00a31.86 million in respect of the value of Bidco shall be added to the Group's assets under management, comprising:\n\u00b7\nthe equity holding of EMV Capital in Bidco, representing 43.8 per cent. of the issued share capital (reducing to 30 per cent. on a fully diluted basis, assuming all Warrants are exercised), which equates to a fair value of c.\u00a3560,000 (which amount is entirely a gain to EMVC minus its initial cash investment of just \u00a3100); and\n\u00b7\nthe Group's third party assets under management with Bidco, representing 56.2 per cent. of the issued share capital (rising to 70 per cent. on a fully diluted basis assuming all Warrants are exercised), which equates to a fair value of c.\u00a31.3 million.\nAbout Destiny Pharma and XF-73\nDestiny Pharma was an AIM-quoted clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialisation of novel medicines to prevent and cure life threatening infections. In particular, its XF-73 programme was focused on the prevention of post-surgical site infections, a major part in the fight against the worldwide epidemic of antibiotic resistant S. aureus (including MRSA). Having been quoted on AIM until 13 August 2024, the company subsequently appointed administrators on 21 August 2024 and liquidators on 1 August 2025.\nKey potential benefits of the XF drug platform acquired by Bidco include:\n\u00b7\nultra-rapid bacteria kill;\n\u00b7\nability to kill bacteria in any growth phase;\n\u00b7\nability to kill bacteria within staphylococcal bacterial biofilms;\n\u00b7\nactive against all Gram positive bacteria tested to date and selected Gram negative bacteria; and\n\u00b7\nno bacterial (MRSA) resistance is seen to emerge.\nPrior to going into administrat",

The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business.\nIn connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot.\nFollowing completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024.\nIn addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Investor Director of Q-Bot, commented:\n\"We are pleased to see this important first closing of Q-Bot's fundraising programme, and to have increased our interest in this exciting business through our capital efficient convertible loans. After a challenging period, we believe Q-Bot is now well-positioned to move towards profitability with a strong team, a robust partner network and pipeline, a well-evolved product offering with a proven application, and a refreshed, lean operating model.\"\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Ed Hooper, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Company.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE UK VERSION OF REGULATION (EU) NO 596/2014 WHICH IS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED.

The presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders.

During the year, we successfully launched our Fund Management practice, having secured FCA authorisation and taken on the management of the Martlet Capital fund. As a result, the Group now benefits from a broader and more resilient revenue mix, comprising: recurring fund management fees; corporate finance and advisory income; board membership compensation; and Value Creation Services.\n\"We have now rebranded all these activities under the 'EMV' umbrella, while continuing to promote the individual identity of funds such as Martlet Capital.\"\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nGroup Performance\n\u00b7\nIn December 2024 EMV Capital Plc successfully executed a \u00a31.5 million placing of ordinary shares (at a 15% premium to the previous closing price), with substantial participation by Directors and management.\n\u00b7\nThe Group's performance includes the operational core of EMV Capital plc, EMV Capital Partners and other EMV Capital operating companies, alongside subsidiary portfolio companies where the Group holds over a 50% shareholding.\n\u00b7\nGroup revenue increased to \u00a32.5 million (2023: \u00a31.4 million), comprising:\no\n\u00a32.0 million from EMV Capital core revenue, a strong increase of 67% (2023: \u00a31.2 million), which covered c.58% of the core Group's costs whilst also providing infrastructure and services to the Group and its portfolio companies;\n\u00a7\nNew recurring fund management fees from Martlet Capital of \u00a30.5 million or c.70% of the 54% annual revenue growth over prior year; and\no\n\u00a30.5 million from ProAxsis (2023: \u00a30.2 million).\n\u00b7\nGroup losses for the year were \u00a33.7 million (2023: \u00a32.9 million), comprising:\no\n\u00a31.5 million attributed to the 'core' of the operations of EMV Capital (2023: \u00a31.1 million); and\no\n\u00a32.2 million attributed to the subsidiary portfolio companies ProAxsis and Glycotest (2023: \u00a31.8 million). The result includes \u00a30.6 million (2023: \u00a30.7 million) of non-cash impairment charges for ProAxsis. In line with our capital efficient investment strategy, ProAxsis and Glycotest were funded by external investors and as such, were not a cash burden to Group operations.\n\u00b7\nTotal assets decreased to \u00a319.5 million (2023: \u00a322.5 million), with net assets decreasing to \u00a314.1 million (2023: \u00a317.1 million), primarily driven by the decrease in value of the direct investments in PDS and Q-Bot.\n\u00b7\nDivestments from PDS Biotech during the period of \u00a30.2 million (2023: \u00a31.4 million from PDS Biotech and Q-Bot).\n\u00b7\nCapital efficient investments during the period of \u00a31.0 million (2023: \u00a30.1 million) through minimal use of cash.\n\u00b7\nCash on the balance sheet was \u00a31.0 million at 31 December 2024 (2023: \u00a30.2 million), with a further \u00a31.4 million in readily realisable quoted securities at 31 December 2024 (2023: \u00a34.3 million). The Group has \u00a31.1 million of cash and \u00a31.0 million as readily realisable quoted securities at 31 May 2025.\nAssets Under Management\n\u00b7\nTotal assets under management (AUM) (including directly held assets included in the audited financial statements and those managed for third parties for which we have carried interest arrangements) increased by 33% to \u00a398.5 million (2023: \u00a374.0 million), comprising:\no\nFair Value of direct holdings increased by 6% to \u00a337.7 million (2023: \u00a335.6 million). These direct holdings may be broken down as follows:\n\u00a7\n\u00a313.4 million of balance sheet investments (2023: \u00a316.4 million), the decrease in fair value is mainly attributable to Q-Bot, PDS and FOx, partly offset by increases in fair value of DeepTech Recycling and Wanda; and\n\u00a7\n\u00a324.3 million of subsidiaries and associates at directors' unaudited valuations (2023: \u00a319.2 million); or\n\u00a7\n\u00a336.3 million for the private unlisted portfolio (2023: \u00a331.3 million) and \u00a31.4 million for the public listed portfolio (NASDAQ-listed PDS) (2023: \u00a34.3 million).\n\u00a7\nThere was \u00a31.9 million of new investments by EMV Capital across the portfol",

We are pleased to announce that site activation is progressing, and that Mayo Clinic sites have recently been added to the trial. HPV16-positive HNSCC represents a large, rapidly growing patient population in need of targeted therapies to treat the underlying cause of the cancer, and our Versamune\u00ae HPV investigational therapy is currently the only targeted therapy in a Phase 3 trial specifically for HPV-16 positive tumours.\"\nClinical and Corporate Update\n\u00b7\nOn April 23, 2025, PDS Biotech announced that three abstracts on Versamune\u00ae HPV (PDS0101) were selected for presentation at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, to be held May 30-June 3, 2025, in Chicago, IL.\n\u00b7\nOn May 8, 2025, PDS Biotech announced that preclinical efficacy and immune response data with a novel investigational Infectimune\u00ae based universal flu vaccine were featured in two presentations on universal influenza vaccines, including an oral symposium at the American Association of Immunologists' IMMUNOLOGY2025\u2122 Annual Meeting, held May 3-7, 2025, in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\u00b7\nOn March 13, 2025, PDS Biotech announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") clearance of an Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application for the combination of Versamune\u00ae MUC1 and PDS01ADC to treat MUC1-positive unresectable, metastatic colorectal carcinoma in patients who failed previous treatment. The National Cancer Institute (\"NCI\"), under its Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (\"CRADA\"), will lead the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of Versamune\u00ae MUC1 + PDS01ADC in recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\u00b7\nOn March 7, 2025, PDS Biotech announced the initiation of its VERSATILE-003 Phase 3 trial in HPV16-positive first-line recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC.\n\u00b7\nTrial is designed to include approximately 350 patients\n\u00b7\nPDS Biotech is aligned with the FDA on the design of the registrational trial and clinical endpoints.\n\u00a7\nTwo-arm controlled trial with 2:1 randomisation\n\u00a7\nMedian overall survival is the primary endpoint\n\u00a7\nInterim readouts included in the study design\n\u00b7\nPDS Biotech received FDA Fast Track designation for the combination of Versamune\u00ae HPV and pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC.\n\u00b7\nFor more information on VERSATILE-003, visit\nClinicalTrials.gov\n(Identifier:\nNCT06790966\n).\n\u00b7\nOn February 27, 2025, PDS Biotech announced that it had entered into securities purchase agreements with new and existing healthcare-focused institutional investors, as well as participation from certain directors of PDS, for the purchase and sale of 7,330,121 shares of its common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,330,121 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules at a combined purchase price of $1.50 for the institutional investors and $1.66 for certain directors of PDS. Approximately $11 million was funded upon the closing of the offering, and up to an additional $11 million may be funded upon full cash exercise of the warrants.\nFirst Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nReported net loss was approximately $8.5 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $10.6 million, or $0.30 per basic share and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was due to increased benefit from income taxes and lower operating expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower clinical trial expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to $3.4 million for the three months",

It has also launched a fundraising programme to raise up to \u00a3800,000 (\nFundraising\n), to deliver commercial progress towards profitability, following a significant reduction in losses.\nProAxsis leverages its proprietary protease-targeted technology and NEATstik platform to address unmet needs in chronic respiratory disease diagnostics.\nSummary of financial and operational progress\n1. Revenue growth and efficiency\n\u00b7\n31 December 2024 full-year revenues increased by 92% to \u00a3470,000 (provisional, unaudited)\n\u00b7\nReduced staff costs by 40% and overall operating costs by 28%\n\u00b7\nLosses reduced to \u00a3718,000, down by 47% from 2023 results (provisional, unaudited)\n2. Market expansion and partnerships\n\u00b7\nStrong sales pipeline for 2025, including provisional orders of \u00a3650,000\n\u00b7\nAdvanced plans for a clinical study in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in partnership with Imperial College London, targeted at expanding clinical trials\n\u00b7\nStrengthened partnerships with Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi, and University of Dundee\n\u00b7\nWithin the Innovate UK-funded NEATstik project, a prototype is anticipated in April 2025\n3. Grant funding as previously announced\n\u00b7\nInnovate UK SMART Grant awarded alongside CPI, with \u00a3333,000 allocated to ProAxsis for advancing the second-generation NEATstik platform\n\u00b7\nAdditional grant of \u00a3165,000 from LifeArc\nRefinement of the scope of the \u00a3900k multi-year grant from the Precision Medicine Consortium\nDetails of the Fundraising\nThe Fundraising will be by way of issue of new shares in the capital of ProAxsis to third party existing and new shareholders syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited, the Company's wholly owned VC and corporate finance firm. It is anticipated that the Fundraising will close over a number of tranches during the course of 2025.\nProAxsis has indicated that it intends for the proceeds of the Fundraising (assuming \u00a3800,000 is raised) to be divided as to \u00a3500,000 towards core business activities, and \u00a3300,000 towards advancing a COPD clinical study with Imperial College.\nThe Group's existing total fully diluted equity holding in ProAxsis is 88.5% with other assets under management (third party management funds) of an additional 9.0%. As announced in the Company's interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2024, the fair value (as at 30 June 2024) of the Company's stake in ProAxsis is estimated to be\u00a0\u00a38.0 million, with other assets under management having an additional fair value of \u00a30.8 million. As the Fundraising issue price is intended to be unchanged since the previous fundraising of ProAxsis (announced 15 April 2024) it is anticipated that such fair value amounts will not be affected by the Fundraising.\nIlian Iliev, CEO of EMVC PLC, commented:\n\"During 2024, ProAxsis made significant progress in stabilising the business platform, advancing its commercial development and progressing its clinical trials plans for the COPD space. Through our value creation services programme, EMV Capital helped ProAxsis evolve to a leaner and more focused business. The company is in a good position to enter the next stage of its development. The current fundraise is aimed at delivering critical clinical milestones, commercial traction, and significant future value creation and we look forward to continuing to work alongside ProAxsis to achieve these. \"\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Ed Hooper, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Company.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE UK VERSION OF REGULATION (EU) NO 596/2014 WHICH IS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED.

However, in the absence of significant growth prior to its next equity fundraising, it is anticipated that the fair value of Q-Bot could be materially lower than the previously reported figure (direct equity holding of 17.0 per cent. with a fair value of \u00a32.7 million; and other AUM equity holding of 37.4 per cent. with a fair value of \u00a36.0 million).\nAdmission of Consideration Shares and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made for the Consideration Shares, which will rank pari passu with existing Ordinary Shares, to be admitted to AIM (\nAdmission\n). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will commence at 8.00 a.m. on or around 3 January 2025.\nFollowing Admission, the total issued share capital of the Company will consist of 27,767,391 Ordinary Shares. The Company does not hold any shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 27,767,391 Ordinary Shares. This number may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Ed Hooper, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Company.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE UK VERSION OF REGULATION (EU) NO 596/2014 WHICH IS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED.

This represents a c.21.5x increase on the Group's investment of \u00a362,000 (paid for by in-kind services) earlier in May 2024.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Wanda Health by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Wanda Health is 17.3 per cent. of the fully diluted share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a31.1 million. Such percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nThe Group has also entered into an unsecured convertible loan agreement with Wanda Health for \u00a350,000 (\nCLA\n) by means of exchanging receivables for that value from its in-kind services. The terms of the CLA include interest accruing at 10 per cent. per annum, a two year maturity date with the Group having the ability to convert some or all of the loan into further equity in Wanda Health at a 20 per cent. discount to its next fundraising round.\nDue to investor demand the Fundraising has been extended, with at least a further \u00a3200,000 anticipated to complete within December 2024.\nThe proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Wanda Health with the capital to execute its growth strategy, which includes:\n\u00b7\nEnhancing its AI capabilities by developing disease specific AI algorithms for readmission risk.\n\u00b7\nExpanding its market presence in US markets by targeting 'Fee for Service' and 'Value Based Care' models.\n\u00b7\nDeveloping white label solutions for its growing partner network in order to unlock new revenue streams across market segments.\n\u00b7\nAdvancing regulatory pathways toward FDA clearance for the first outpatient-based adjunctive predictive cardiovascular risk indicator.\nWanda Health recently announced a high-profile partnership with COPD Foundation providing it with access to world leading clinical experts, clinical guideline content, as well as joint marketing and advertising opportunities. This collaboration enhances Wanda Health's ability to refine its disease monitoring platform, particularly for conditions like COPD, which affects over 400 million people globally.\nWanda Health, a spinout from UCLA, is a leading remote patient monitoring and virtual care platform operating in the UK and US. Delivered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, it is cloud-hosted with proprietary machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Wanda Health empowers healthcare providers and payers by enabling early detection of health exacerbations across acute, chronic, and specialty disease spaces, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.\nWanda Health operates in a high-growth sector, with RPM projected to grow to $175 billion by 2027, Remote Therapeutic Management estimated to reach $17 billion by 2030, and Chronic Care Management predicted to reach $32 billion by 2033\u00b9. With a robust pipeline of growth opportunities, Wanda Health is well-positioned to lead the way in RPM and Virtual Care.\n1\n6Wresearch Market Research Report, September 2024\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Chair of Wanda\nHealth, commented:\n\"We are delighted to see Wanda Health successfully close this fundraising. This is a pivotal moment for Wanda Health as it continues to grow its leadership position in the rapidly expanding RPM market, building on its trans-Atlantic presence in the UK and US. EMV Capital is proud to have contributed strategic and investment support through our Venture Building programme. We look forward to seeing Wanda\nHealth's impact grow as it scales its operations in the US and beyond.\"\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Ed Hooper, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Company.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE UK VERSION OF REGULATION (EU) NO 596/2014 WHICH IS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED.

IN ADDITION, MARKET SOUNDINGS (AS DEFINED IN MAR) WERE TAKEN IN RESPECT OF THE FUNDRAISING WITH THE RESULT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS BECAME AWARE OF INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN MAR), AS PERMITTED BY MAR. THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS SET OUT IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THEREFORE, THOSE PERSONS THAT RECEIVED INSIDE INFORMATION IN A MARKET SOUNDING ARE NO LONGER IN POSSESSION OF SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANY AND ITS SECURITIES.\nEMV Capital plc\n(\"\nEMV Capital\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\" or the \"\nGroup\n\")\nProposed Subscription and Retail Offer\nto raise up to \u00a31.5 million\nUpdate on financial operations and the portfolio\nEMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, today announces its intention to raise up to \u00a31.5 million (\nFundraising\n) through a proposed subscription by, and retail offer to, new and existing investors for new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\nNew Shares\n) at an issue price of \u00a30.50 per New Share (\nIssue Price\n). The Issue Price represents a\npremium of approximately 15 per cent. to the closing mid-market price of 43.5 pence per ordinary share in the capital of the Company on 2 December 2024 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this announcement).\nA further announcement will be made by the Company shortly regarding the Retail Offer (as defined below) and its terms. It is expected that the Retail Offer will launch today, 3 December 2024, shortly after this Announcement and will be open for applications up to 4.30 p.m. on 4 December 2024, or such later time and date as the Company and Winterflood Securities Limited (\nWinterflood\n) may agree. The result of the Retail Offer is expected to be announced by the Company on or around 5 December 2024. For the avoidance of doubt, the Retail Offer is in addition to, and conditional upon the completion of, the Subscription. There can be no guarantee that the Retail Offer will be fully subscribed.\nThe Fundraising will be effected pursuant to the existing authorities to allot equity securities granted at the Company's annual general meeting on 10 July 2024.\n1. Background to and reasons for the Fundraising\nEMV Capital is positioning itself to become a leading venture capital (VC) investment group, specialising in the deeptech and life sciences sectors. The Company aims to deliver shareholder value by identifying and investing in companies with transformative technologies both within the UK and internationally.\nThe Group's strategy focuses on achieving capital returns through the profitable exits of selected portfolio companies, as well as generating carried interest from its growing Funds practice. An example of this approach is demonstrated through the strong performance of the Group's Venture Building programme. Over the past two years, this initiative has driven significant growth in the fair value of EMV Capital's direct holdings, notably in the following cohort portfolio companies to a total of \u00a37.1 million, achieved with an initial total investment of just \u00a30.4 million in cash, complemented by \u00a30.4 million of in-kind services.\nThis performance highlights EMV Capital's ability to create significant value with a disciplined and innovative approach to investment.\nPortfolio company\nBusiness sector\nDirect FV increase\nDeeptech Recycling Technologies\nPlastic waste recycling\n\u00a31.8 million\nDName-iT\nLab blood verification\n\u00a31.6 million\nVentive\nHeat pump developer\n\u00a30.9 million\nVortex Biosciences\nLiquid biopsy/oncology\n\u00a32.8 million\nTotal\n-\n\u00a37.1 million\nIn the first half of 2024, EMV Capital achieved a significant milestone, surpassing \u00a3100 million in assets under management (\nAUM\n). This coincided with the successful launch of the Company's Fund Management practice. As announced on 30 September 2024 in its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (\nInterim Results\n), the Company's AUM comprised a fair value of \u00a341 million in directly owned holdings and \u00a365.7 million in managed and third-party holdings. EMV Capital's portfolio now spans over 70 companies, bolstered by the May 2024 mandate to manage the Cambridge-based Martlet Capital portfolio.\nThe Company is progressing its strategy to achieve operational self-sufficiency by covering most, if not all, core costs through recurring fund management fees, value creation services, corporate finance activities, and other income streams. The Directors have identified a route to break-even, targeting recurring annual fund management fees of over \u00a31 million. This will be supported by a targeted increase of \u00a330 million to \u00a350 million (or more) in AUM during 2025/26.\nAs outlined in the annual accounts for the period ending 31 December 2023, the Group, including its subsidiari",

The abstract was granted Basic/Translational Science Award from the\u00a0ASTRO Annual Meeting Steering Committee.\nPDS Biotech is a late-stage immunotherapy company focused on transforming how the immune system targets and kills cancers and the development of infectious disease vaccines\nAnn Klopp, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Radiation Oncology and Head of the Gynecologic Section at MD Anderson said:\n\"HPV is responsible for virtually all cervical cancers and presents an opportunity for immunologic targeting.1 However, there are currently no FDA-approved HPV-targeted immunotherapies to treat cervical cancer. These data suggest that further investigation is warranted into the safety and efficacy of Versamune\u00ae HPV in combination with standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer.\"\nThe IMMUNOCERV Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04580771) evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Versamune\u00ae HPV in combination with standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. The investigator-initiated study enrolled 17 newly diagnosed high-risk patients with large tumours of at least 5 cm in size. Highlights from the presentation include:\n\u00b7\nAll patients received at least 2 doses of Versamune\u00ae HPV.\n\u00b7\nMedian follow-up was 19 months.\n\u00b7\n36-month overall survival (OS) rate was 84.4%, and 100% for the eight patients who received all five doses of Versamune\u00ae HPV. Historical published data show 36-month OS rate with chemoradiation in this population of approximately 64%.2\n\u00b7\n36-month progression free survival (PFS) rate was 74.9%, among all patients and 100% for the eight patients who received all five doses of Versamune\u00ae HPV. Historical published data show 36-month PFS rate with chemoradiation in this population of approximately 61%.2\n\u00b7\nComplete metabolic response (CMR) was achieved in 15/17 (88%) patients.\n\u00b7\nVersamune\u00ae HPV appeared to be safe and well-tolerated. The most common treatment-related toxicities were injection site reactions in twelve patients (71%).\nFrank Bedu-Addo, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of PDS Biotech said:\n\"We are pleased that data from the Phase 2 IMMUNOCERV trial demonstrate compelling clinical activity and a promising safety profile. Based on our continued research in various HPV-positive cancers, Versamune\u00ae HPV appears to work in combination with a variety of therapeutic agents to generate clinical responses and promote improved survival in patients with minimal toxicity. We look forward to the next steps in the development of Versamune\u00ae HPV for locally advanced cervical cancer.\"\n1.

Similarly, the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm, EMV Capital Limited, has changed its name to EMV Capital Partners Limited with immediate effect.\nThe Company confirms that its change of name has been notified to the London Stock Exchange and trading in the Company's shares under the new company name and new TIDM code, \"EMVC\", is expected to commence at 8.00 a.m. on 26 September 2024. The Company's ISIN and SEDOL remain unchanged.\nIn conjunction with its name change, the Company's website address will change to emvcapital.com. All information required by Rule 26 of the AIM Rules for Companies will be located on the \"Investors\" section of the website with effect from 8.00 a.m. on 26 September 2024.\nShareholders rights are unaffected by these changes and existing share certificates should be retained and remain valid.\nBackground to the Company's name change and rebranding\nThe rebranding marks the culmination of NetScientific's strategic evolution, since acquiring EMV Capital in 2020, to a fully integrated venture capital and corporate finance business.\nThe Group has grown substantially in both scale and scope since its inception. In 2019, the Group's portfolio fair value stood at approximately \u00a38 million. Today, through its capital-efficient model and strategic value-creation services, the Group has established itself as a key player in venture capital, spanning deep tech, life sciences, and other innovative sectors. The EMV Capital brand, used by the Group since 2020, is already highly regarded and well established in this space, and as such the name change and rebranding across the Group is a logical step towards unifying the Group's offerings to its stakeholders.\nEMV Capital plc now manages a diversified portfolio of over 70 companies with estimated AUM exceeding \u00a3100 million (as announced on 13 June 2024), significantly expanding beyond its origins and is uniquely positioned to leverage its expertise across fund management, corporate finance, and portfolio growth services to deliver positive returns for investors, even when market conditions remain challenging.\nAs\nEMV Capital plc\n, the Group continues its expansion beyond life sciences into deep tech, including sectors such as sustainability, digital health, and advanced materials. The Company's ability to provide fund management, corporate finance, and syndication services across its portfolio enables it to identify, nurture, and accelerate the growth of early-stage companies. By offering hands-on support through each growth phase, EMV Capital is committed to helping companies scale while delivering meaningful societal impact.\nWith a goal to further grow Assets Under Management, the Group aims to scale its capital-efficient investment model, expand its fund management practice, and enhance the value of its portfolio through targeted investments and value-creation services.\nDr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital plc, commented:\n\"Since acquiring EMV Capital in 2020, we have consolidated our operations, significantly grown our portfolio, and expanded our strategic focus. This new identity for our Group reflects our business today-an agile, multi-sector venture capital firm committed to delivering superior returns from innovative, high-growth companies.\n\"With Assets Under Management having surpassed \u00a3100 million, this milestone highlights our success in navigating a challenging market and underscores our ambitious plans for the future.

A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested.

The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

Worth multiples more when they hit the next funding round if the figures below come in. If the roll out across the USA goes well the sky is the limit for tech/AI valuations. August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

Vortex Biotech Holdings, (\u2018Vortex\u2019, or \u2018the Company\u2019), a leading oncology liquid biopsy company, is pleased to announce the appointment of Nigel Brooksby as Non-Executive Chairman. Nigel is an experienced industry leader with extensive experience chairing and directing public and private companies. His career includes leadership roles in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Notably, he was Chairman and CEO of Sanofi UK, where he helped build the company into one of the top 10 pharmaceutical business globally. Nigel has also held senior positions at GSK and Pfizer International USA. His deep understanding of the financial, operational, and strategic aspects of the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, combined with his exceptional global network, will be invaluable as Vortex enters its next phase of growth. Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

Good news is that ProAxis is part of the consortium so with any luck they should receive their own lump of grant funding. Let's hope they actually release the news rather than keep us in the dark! \u00a355m shot in the arm for precision medicine in Northern Ireland Economy Minister Conor Murphy, Wendy Moore, director of data analytics at Diaceutics plc and Professor Sir Ian Greer, vice chancellor, Queen\u2019s University, Belfast Today at 12:12 Precision medicine in Northern Ireland has received a \u00a355m shot in the arm thanks to a joint effort from industry and academia. Economy Minister Conor Murphy launched the Future Medicines Institute (FMI) at Queen\u2019s University on Wednesday. It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

Economy Minister Conor Murphy launched the Future Medicines Institute (FMI) at Queen\u2019s University on Wednesday. It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

This ignores the recent very good news EMV Capital Recommendation price: 48.1p Current price: 57.5p Technology company adviser and investor EMV Capital EMVC 5.26% performed strongly at the end of the year. A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

Vortex Biotech Holdings, (\u2018Vortex\u2019, or \u2018the Company\u2019), a leading oncology liquid biopsy company, is pleased to announce the appointment of Nigel Brooksby as Non-Executive Chairman. Nigel is an experienced industry leader with extensive experience chairing and directing public and private companies. His career includes leadership roles in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Notably, he was Chairman and CEO of Sanofi UK, where he helped build the company into one of the top 10 pharmaceutical business globally. Nigel has also held senior positions at GSK and Pfizer International USA. His deep understanding of the financial, operational, and strategic aspects of the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, combined with his exceptional global network, will be invaluable as Vortex enters its next phase of growth. Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

          "content": "Liberum updated Broker note .. EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

Economy Minister Conor Murphy launched the Future Medicines Institute (FMI) at Queen\u2019s University on Wednesday. It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

Good news is that ProAxis is part of the consortium so with any luck they should receive their own lump of grant funding.

Economy Minister Conor Murphy launched the Future Medicines Institute (FMI) at Queen\u2019s University on Wednesday. It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

This ignores the recent very good news EMV Capital Recommendation price: 48.1p Current price: 57.5p Technology company adviser and investor EMV Capital EMVC 5.26% performed strongly at the end of the year. A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

          "content": "VORTEX BIOTECH HOLDINGS ANNOUNCES HIGH PROFILE APPOINTMENT Nigel Brooksby appointed as Non-Executive Chairman London, 28 January 2025. Vortex Biotech Holdings, (\u2018Vortex\u2019, or \u2018the Company\u2019), a leading oncology liquid biopsy company, is pleased to announce the appointment of Nigel Brooksby as Non-Executive Chairman. Nigel is an experienced industry leader with extensive experience chairing and directing public and private companies. His career includes leadership roles in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Notably, he was Chairman and CEO of Sanofi UK, where he helped build the company into one of the top 10 pharmaceutical business globally. Nigel has also held senior positions at GSK and Pfizer International USA. His deep understanding of the financial, operational, and strategic aspects of the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, combined with his exceptional global network, will be invaluable as Vortex enters its next phase of growth. Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

Economy Minister Conor Murphy launched the Future Medicines Institute (FMI) at Queen\u2019s University on Wednesday. It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

          "content": "Liberum updated Broker note .. EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

This ignores the recent very good news EMV Capital Recommendation price: 48.1p Current price: 57.5p Technology company adviser and investor EMV Capital EMVC 5.26% performed strongly at the end of the year. A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

Worth multiples more when they hit the next funding round if the figures below come in. If the roll out across the USA goes well the sky is the limit for tech/AI valuations. August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

Vortex Biotech Holdings, (\u2018Vortex\u2019, or \u2018the Company\u2019), a leading oncology liquid biopsy company, is pleased to announce the appointment of Nigel Brooksby as Non-Executive Chairman. Nigel is an experienced industry leader with extensive experience chairing and directing public and private companies. His career includes leadership roles in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Notably, he was Chairman and CEO of Sanofi UK, where he helped build the company into one of the top 10 pharmaceutical business globally. Nigel has also held senior positions at GSK and Pfizer International USA. His deep understanding of the financial, operational, and strategic aspects of the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, combined with his exceptional global network, will be invaluable as Vortex enters its next phase of growth. Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

This ignores the recent very good news EMV Capital Recommendation price: 48.1p Current price: 57.5p Technology company adviser and investor EMV Capital EMVC 5.26% performed strongly at the end of the year. A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

We continue to see the benefit of our AIM quotation, particularly in our ability to selectively issue shares to strategic counterparties and as a differentiator to other VC peers, providing an added layer of 'institution grade' confidence to co-investors and portfolio companies. Staying on Aim, NAV \u00a337.7M vs \u00a311M M CAP. Good and bad news in the results but nothing to warrant a 40p share price.

          "content": "VORTEX BIOTECH HOLDINGS ANNOUNCES HIGH PROFILE APPOINTMENT Nigel Brooksby appointed as Non-Executive Chairman London, 28 January 2025. Vortex Biotech Holdings, (\u2018Vortex\u2019, or \u2018the Company\u2019), a leading oncology liquid biopsy company, is pleased to announce the appointment of Nigel Brooksby as Non-Executive Chairman. Nigel is an experienced industry leader with extensive experience chairing and directing public and private companies. His career includes leadership roles in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Notably, he was Chairman and CEO of Sanofi UK, where he helped build the company into one of the top 10 pharmaceutical business globally. Nigel has also held senior positions at GSK and Pfizer International USA. His deep understanding of the financial, operational, and strategic aspects of the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, combined with his exceptional global network, will be invaluable as Vortex enters its next phase of growth. Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

This ignores the recent very good news EMV Capital Recommendation price: 48.1p Current price: 57.5p Technology company adviser and investor EMV Capital EMVC 5.26% performed strongly at the end of the year. A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

Worth multiples more when they hit the next funding round if the figures below come in. If the roll out across the USA goes well the sky is the limit for tech/AI valuations. August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

It assumes all portfolio companies are treated as investments rather than as subsidiaries and therefore excludes portfolio company operating revenues while including fundraising and other fees charged by EMV Capital core. EMV Capital core\ncomprises EMV Capital plc, EMV Capital Partners Limited and other EMV Capital operating companies in the Group.\nOutlook\nEMV Capital continues to see high-quality opportunities across its portfolio and pipeline despite market conditions for venture capital and exits remaining challenging. Structural tailwinds across deep tech, life sciences and sustainability, including healthcare demand, defence and security priorities, and industrial and supply-chain realignment all continue to strengthen. Whilst no major exits occurred during the period, several portfolio companies have been and continue to be engaged in potential M&A and other strategic partnership discussions, evidencing a greater market appetite for corporate transactional activities and growth.\nThe Group remains focused on disciplined capital deployment, proactive portfolio management and the continued scaling of its Funds and Venture Building platforms. The Board believes EMV Capital is well positioned to navigate ongoing market uncertainty and to benefit from a recovery in capital markets as sentiment improves.\nKey Portfolio Highlights2\nDuring 2025, a number of portfolio companies made strong strategic, commercial and technical progress, advancing towards key value inflection points despite a selective funding environment. Selected highlights include:\nNote (2): Portfolio holdings and fair values below are stated on a fully diluted basis (including share options and warrants but excluding convertible loans).\nWanda Health\nOperates in the rapidly expanding US Remote Patient Monitoring market",

          "content": "Our stake \u00a30.8M back up to \u00a31.4M. Nice to see it going the right way again! Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

Vortex Biotech Holdings, (\u2018Vortex\u2019, or \u2018the Company\u2019), a leading oncology liquid biopsy company, is pleased to announce the appointment of Nigel Brooksby as Non-Executive Chairman. Nigel is an experienced industry leader with extensive experience chairing and directing public and private companies. His career includes leadership roles in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Notably, he was Chairman and CEO of Sanofi UK, where he helped build the company into one of the top 10 pharmaceutical business globally. Nigel has also held senior positions at GSK and Pfizer International USA. His deep understanding of the financial, operational, and strategic aspects of the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, combined with his exceptional global network, will be invaluable as Vortex enters its next phase of growth. Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

Good news is that ProAxis is part of the consortium so with any luck they should receive their own lump of grant funding. Let's hope they actually release the news rather than keep us in the dark! \u00a355m shot in the arm for precision medicine in Northern Ireland Economy Minister Conor Murphy, Wendy Moore, director of data analytics at Diaceutics plc and Professor Sir Ian Greer, vice chancellor, Queen\u2019s University, Belfast Today at 12:12 Precision medicine in Northern Ireland has received a \u00a355m shot in the arm thanks to a joint effort from industry and academia. Economy Minister Conor Murphy launched the Future Medicines Institute (FMI) at Queen\u2019s University on Wednesday. It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

This ignores the recent very good news EMV Capital Recommendation price: 48.1p Current price: 57.5p Technology company adviser and investor EMV Capital EMVC 5.26% performed strongly at the end of the year. A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

Worth multiples more when they hit the next funding round if the figures below come in. If the roll out across the USA goes well the sky is the limit for tech/AI valuations. August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

          "content": "Liberum updated Broker note .. EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

Worth multiples more when they hit the next funding round if the figures below come in. If the roll out across the USA goes well the sky is the limit for tech/AI valuations. August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

          "content": "Our stake \u00a30.8M back up to \u00a31.4M. Nice to see it going the right way again! Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

Vortex Biotech Holdings, (\u2018Vortex\u2019, or \u2018the Company\u2019), a leading oncology liquid biopsy company, is pleased to announce the appointment of Nigel Brooksby as Non-Executive Chairman. Nigel is an experienced industry leader with extensive experience chairing and directing public and private companies. His career includes leadership roles in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Notably, he was Chairman and CEO of Sanofi UK, where he helped build the company into one of the top 10 pharmaceutical business globally. Nigel has also held senior positions at GSK and Pfizer International USA. His deep understanding of the financial, operational, and strategic aspects of the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors, combined with his exceptional global network, will be invaluable as Vortex enters its next phase of growth. Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

Good news is that ProAxis is part of the consortium so with any luck they should receive their own lump of grant funding. Let's hope they actually release the news rather than keep us in the dark! \u00a355m shot in the arm for precision medicine in Northern Ireland Economy Minister Conor Murphy, Wendy Moore, director of data analytics at Diaceutics plc and Professor Sir Ian Greer, vice chancellor, Queen\u2019s University, Belfast Today at 12:12 Precision medicine in Northern Ireland has received a \u00a355m shot in the arm thanks to a joint effort from industry and academia. Economy Minister Conor Murphy launched the Future Medicines Institute (FMI) at Queen\u2019s University on Wednesday. It\u2019s backed by \u00a335m from the NI Executive and \u00a320m from NI companies in diagnostics and therapeutics. The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient. Mr Murphy said: \u201cThis \u00a355m investment in the FMI is a landmark step for precision medicine in the north which will strengthen our life and health sciences sector and reinforce the region\u2019s role in global healthcare innovation. \u201cFMI will foster collaboration across industry, academia, and healthcare to accelerate the development of new drugs and diagnostics, driving growth in our economy. \"It will provide a vital pathway to speed up patient access to personalised treatments, streamline drug development processes, and bring innovative solutions to market at pace.\u201d The \u00a355m is to be used to fund research and development between companies and universities, and to create a shared lab inside Queen\u2019s.",

EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

This ignores the recent very good news EMV Capital Recommendation price: 48.1p Current price: 57.5p Technology company adviser and investor EMV Capital EMVC 5.26% performed strongly at the end of the year. A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

Worth multiples more when they hit the next funding round if the figures below come in. If the roll out across the USA goes well the sky is the limit for tech/AI valuations. August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.

Q-Bot Limited Fundraising EMV Capital plc (AIM: EMVC), the deeptech and life sciences VC investment group, announces that its portfolio company Q-Bot Limited (Q-Bot), the commercial stage robotics company developing solutions for the built environment, has successfully closed an initial tranche of c.\u00a3350,000 of its equity fundraising programme of up to \u00a31 million, alongside the conversion of c.\u00a3865,000 of outstanding convertible loans and associated interest (Fundraising). The Fundraising has been led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (EMV Capital Partners), the Company's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. The first closing of the Fundraising primarily represents investment from Q-Bot's existing loyal shareholder base, with further funding anticipated from new and existing investors as the Fundraising continues with further closings. The proceeds from the Fundraising will provide Q-Bot with the capital to continue the execution of its growth strategy following its recent transition to a lean technology business. In connection with the Fundraising, EMVC exercised its right to convert a convertible loan (and accrued interest thereon), announced on 31 December 2024, at a conversion price per Q-Bot share at a 70 per cent. discount to the Fundraising issue price, thereby protecting EMVC's existing shareholding stake in Q-Bot. Following completion of the Fundraising and anticipated full conversion of the convertible loan, the Group's total equity holding in Q-Bot will be 30.2 per cent of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.4 million. This represents a c.71 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.8 million at 31 December 2024. In addition, following the introduction of additional investors to Q-Bot by EMV Capital Partners, the Group's third party assets under management with Q-Bot is 45.3 per cent. of the issued share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a32.1 million. This represents a c.16 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.8 million at 31 December 2024.",

Nigel Brooksby, incoming Non-Executive Chairman of Vortex, commented, \u201cVortex has a bright future ahead and I am looking forward to contributing to its success. The Company is at the cutting edge of delivering a step-change solution in cancer care. Liquid biopsy technologies utilising circulating tumour cells have the potential to revolutionise how we diagnose and treat cancer, offering the promise of more personalised therapies. I look forward to working alongside the team to continue advancing this critical technology and improving patient outcomes.\u201d Vortex\u2019s Managing Director Paul Reeves, said, \u201cNigel\u2019s appointment is a significant development for Vortex. His expertise in guiding companies from innovation to commercialisation in complex international markets positions us for rapid growth. We are entering a key phase of the business, as we look to build commercial traction for our liquid biopsy offering. With our base at the London Cancer Hub next to the Royal Marsden Hospital, we are ideally situated to lead the field of CTC capture technology and revolutionise therapeutic decision-making.\u201d A key benefit of Vortex\u2019s liquid biopsy platform is that it provides results equivalent to more invasive diagnostic tools, but with the significant advantage of being less invasive and more patient-friendly. By using a blood sample, the liquid biopsy method eliminates the need for more cumbersome and invasive tissue biopsies, ultimately improving the patient experience and comfort. This less intrusive approach has the potential to make cancer diagnosis and monitoring more accessible, faster and less stressful for patients, while still delivering high-accuracy results for clinicians. Nigel Brooksby is taking over from Dr. Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital PLC who was Chair during the Company\u2019s period of development as part of EMV Capital\u2019s Venture Building programme. He noted: \u201cNigel has extensive market knowledge and commercial expertise and I\u2019d like to warmly welcome him t",

The FMI is aimed at driving innovation and production in precision medicine, with the backing of Diaceutics plc, Fusion Antibodies plc, Randox Laboratories, Almac Group, Sonrai Analytics, Exploristics and ProAxsis. Precision medicine is a branch of healthcare which tailors treatment and drugs to the specific needs of a patient.

          "content": "Liberum updated Broker note .. EMVC has continued to display momentum as it migrates towards an operational model which aims to cover a substantial part or all of core costs from recurring fees and value creation services in the core business. The addition of the management mandate from Cambridge-based Martlet Capital offers a tangible near-term boost to recurring revenue generation and AUM, and represents a significant positive step to boosting the sustainability of the strategy. The group now has a diversified and wide portfolio of directly held stakes with the potential for value generation and significant uplift from exits, as well as exposure to carried interest. We also anticipate exits or dilutions in the positions in subsidiaries Glycotest and ProAxsis in the foreseeable future as part of the strategic evolution, and funding needs at both companies are already being met from third party sources. Despite operational progress, the discount at which EMVC\u2019s shares trade to a sum-of-the-parts valuation has deepened to c. -69% (based on live pricing of the listed equity position in PDS Biotechnology); we think this is reflective of domestic market sentiment as opposed to company-specific considerations, and furthermore ignores the potential for highly asymmetric and idiosyncratic value creation from exposure, via direct exposure and carried interest, to over 70 companies. We reiterate our Buy rating,and upgrade our target price to 157p (from 137p)",

A presentation on 1 December concerning investee companies Wanda Health, a remote patient monitoring technology developer, and DeepTech Recycling, which has developed plastic recycling technology, helped attract attention to EMV Capital and boost the share price. Wanda Health subsequently raised \u00a3860,000 in a funding led and syndicated by EMV Capital. Annual recurring revenues could exceed $5 million (\u00a33.7 million) by the end of 2026. The 16.5% stake held by EMV Capital has a value of \u00a31.7 million, up from the \u00a31.5 million valuation at the end of June 2025. The key second-half transaction was the purchase of assets relating to the XF drug platform from the administrator of Destiny Pharma via a new subsidiary for up to \u00a32.475 million. The XF platform reduces the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. This is something that is already well developed with millions of pounds invested. Sector Screener: a review of 2025 and look ahead to 2026 Shares for the future:addressing the oldest investment sin The initial consideration is \u00a3475,000 and the rest depends on the launching of a phase 3 study in the US and regulatory approval, plus receipt of a potential milestone fee relating to a Hong Kong agreement. The deal is funded by a three-year term loan with 100% warrant coverage. EMV Capital led an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) fundraising to provide working capital of \u00a3725,000. EMV Capital will own a 43.8% undiluted stake in the acquisition vehicle for a limited cash cost. Third-party investment under management will have a value of \u00a31.3 million. EMV Capital assets under management (direct and indirect) were \u00a3104.7 million at the end of June 2025, which is a rise of 6%. At the halfway stage the value of the directly owned portfolio increased from \u00a337.7 million to \u00a338.6 million, despite the share price decline in Nasdaq-quoted PDS Biotechnology. There is a spread of healthcare, renewable and technology investments. Core revenues improved 5% to \u00a31.04 million in the first half. EMV Capital is moving towards covering its overheads with its income from advising and raising money for companies, plus fees from managing funds. There is still plenty more value in the portfolio. The timing of any gains is always difficult to predict, though. Still a long-term buy. In my view",

Worth multiples more when they hit the next funding round if the figures below come in. If the roll out across the USA goes well the sky is the limit for tech/AI valuations. August 5, 2025 WANDA SECURES FUNDING PACKAGE As it scales platform across the US We are delighted to announce that portfolio company Wanda Health, the intelligent platform for Remote Patient Monitoring (\u201cRPM\u201d) and Virtual Care, has successfully closed an investment round and made significant commercial progress in the United States. The funding package also includes a \u00a3250,000 loan. Wanda\u2019s platform reduces hospitalisations and readmissions by collecting real-time data from patients at home or in community settings, and alerting clinicians to high-risk individuals. Further investment for growth Wanda has completed a further close of \u00a3834k consisting of EIS investments, a debt facility and CLA conversions, bringing the total closing under this investment round of \u00a31.9m. The investment round was led by EMV Capital Partners Ltd, and the funding will be used to accelerate growth in response to inbound commercial interest. This fundraise follows a period of strong and accelerating commercial performance and further progress towards FDA approval of Wanda\u2019s platform. The \u00a3250,000 loan facility is being implemented to provide growth financing while Wanda delivers on its rapidly scaling customer uptake. Commercial Progress in the US Market Earlier in the year, Wanda secured partnerships with the COPD Foundation and the American Heart Association, strengthening the company\u2019s access to key clinical opinion leaders in core focus areas. Since then, the company has made progress in several market segments. Successful entry in the Pharmacy Benefit Managers segment, accelerating revenues Wanda has now also successfully entered the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (\u201cPBM\u201d) segment. PBMs play a critical role in the US healthcare market by managing prescription drug benefits for over 275 million Americans.[1] In the first half of the year, Wanda closed a new contract with Sav-Rx, a leading US PBM serving a network of over 65,000 pharmacies across the US,[2] and which has the potential to achieve multi-million annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company. Onboarding has already started. Wanda is also developing opportunities with other PBMs. Provider Business Wanda\u2019s Provider Business is performing well, with an additional four new provider sites undertaking Medicare RTM; RPM; and CMM programmes with the company across Sleep Apnoea, Pain Management and General Chronic Disease Management. Assisted Living Wanda has also onboarded a group of assisted living facilities across California, which is a new use case for its team.
