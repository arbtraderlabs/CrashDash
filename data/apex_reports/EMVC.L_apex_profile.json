It assumes all portfolio companies are treated as investments rather than as subsidiaries and therefore excludes portfolio company operating revenues while including fundraising and other fees charged by EMV Capital core. EMV Capital core\ncomprises EMV Capital plc, EMV Capital Partners Limited and other EMV Capital operating companies in the Group.\nOutlook\nEMV Capital continues to see high-quality opportunities across its portfolio and pipeline despite market conditions for venture capital and exits remaining challenging. Structural tailwinds across deep tech, life sciences and sustainability, including healthcare demand, defence and security priorities, and industrial and supply-chain realignment all continue to strengthen. Whilst no major exits occurred during the period, several portfolio companies have been and continue to be engaged in potential M&A and other strategic partnership discussions, evidencing a greater market appetite for corporate transactional activities and growth.\nThe Group remains focused on disciplined capital deployment, proactive portfolio management and the continued scaling of its Funds and Venture Building platforms. The Board believes EMV Capital is well positioned to navigate ongoing market uncertainty and to benefit from a recovery in capital markets as sentiment improves.\nKey Portfolio Highlights2\nDuring 2025, a number of portfolio companies made strong strategic, commercial and technical progress, advancing towards key value inflection points despite a selective funding environment. Selected highlights include:\nNote (2): Portfolio holdings and fair values below are stated on a fully diluted basis (including share options and warrants but excluding convertible loans).\nWanda Health\nOperates in the rapidly expanding US Remote Patient Monitoring market, forecast to reach c.US$110.7 billion by 2033 (CAGR 19.8% from 2025-2033).Secured multi-million-dollar contracts in the US, out-competing larger industry players and delivering consistent double-digit month-on-month revenue growth.Completed a \u00a30.86 million fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners, to support continued commercial expansion.\nEMV Capital holds a 16.5% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a31.7 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 30.2% interest (valued at c.\u00a33.5 million (unaudited)).\nEpiBone\nUS-\nbased\nclinical-stage regenerative medicine specialist focused on skeletal reconstruction.\nCompleted a US$4 million fundraising in 2025, in which EMV Capital Partners played a lead role in syndicating a US$0.75 million co-investment, significantly increasing its direct and indirect stakes in the company and gaining a board observer seat.The proceeds of the funding are to be deployed to accelerate clinical development of its key products and further corporate development.\nEMV Capital holds a 1.7% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a31.3 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 5.3% interest (valued at c.\u00a34.2 million (unaudited)).\nAMR Bio\nNew addition to the Venture Building programme, formed following the acquisition in September 2025 of key intellectual property and clinical assets relating to the XF-73 drug platform from Destiny Pharma Limited, an ex-AIM quoted biotechnology company.AMR Bio, was created to develop the assets and plan a route to commercialisation, with a focus on preparing the company for a Phase 3 clinical trial.The transaction was structured with \u00a3475,000 upfront cash consideration and deferred milestone-linked payments, while introducing third-party capital through EMV Capital Partners and establishing a new venture within the portfolio.\nEMV Capital holds a 30.0% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a30.6 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 70.0% interest (valued at c.\u00a31.3 million (unaudited)).\nDeeptech Recycling Technologies\nProprietary, patented chemical recycling technology converting hard-to-recycle plastic waste into synthetic oil and wax products (Plaxx\u00ae).Strong pipeline of commercial projects progressing toward execution, including a 9,000 tpa plant in Norway supported by c.\u00a311 million of Norwegian government debt financing programme (to be provided subject to matched-funding, which it is anticipated will be provided by project counterparties).Completed a c.\u00a31.22 million equity fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners, to support commercial deployment.\nEMV Capital holds a 18.0% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a32.8 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 29.7% interest (valued at c.\u00a34.7 million (unaudited)).\nSofant Technologies\nAchieved a major industry milestone in October 2025 with the successful demonstration of the world's first fully functioning Ka-band transmit array using proprietary RF MEMS beamforming technology.Supported by programmes with the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency, advancing toward commercial launch.Completed a c.\u00a36.25 million equity fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital, Partners, as the company transitions from R&D into early production and commercial sales.\nEMV Capital holds a 1.1% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a30.5 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 24.1% interest (valued at c.\u00a312.5 million (unaudited)).\nQ-Bot\nUK-based robotics and AI company that provides robotic underfloor insulation and building surveying technologies.Completed a c.\u00a31.1 million fundraising in 2025, led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners, to support Q-Bot's growth strategy, following its recent transition to a lean technology business.\nEMV Capital holds a 27.1% direct interest (valued at c.\u00a31.4 million (unaudited)) and manages third-party capital representing a 53.0% interest (valued at c.\u00a33.5 million (unaudited)).\nMartlet Capital\nDuring the year, EMV Capital completed the full operational integration of Martlet Capital Management into the Group. The Martlet portfolio demonstrated resilience and fair value progression, supported by selective follow-on investments and an initial secondary exit that delivered proceeds of approximately \u00a3320k and a 2.5x return. The integration has strengthened the Group's Funds practice and expanded its opportunity set for recurring management fees, carried interest and third-party AUM growth.\nIn line with Group strategy, EMV Capital's EIS practice has co-invested in Martlet portfolio companies, Xampla (bioplastics) and OctaiPipe (AI datacentre software), and intends to increase its co-investments within the Martlet portfolio. This will deepen the fund's presence in the Cambridge cluster, provide investors with greater diversity, and increase sources of carried interest available to the Group.\nCommenting on the update, Dr Ilian Iliev, Chief Executive Officer of EMV Capital plc, said:\n\"EMV Capital has continued to make steady progress during 2025. We have maintained AUM above \u00a3100 million, completed the integration of Martlet Capital, advanced our Venture Building programme and supported a number of existing and new portfolio companies through important funding and commercial milestones.\n\"Our focus remains on capital efficiency, active portfolio management and building a resilient platform that can deliver long-term value for shareholders. Our operational 'core' income growth is demonstrating the potential of our differentiated strategy to deliver revenue growth even in the absence of liquidity events. Whilst we remain cautious in the near term, we believe the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our operating model position the Group well for further growth as market conditions normalise, and the M&A market improves.\"\nThe person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Ed Hooper, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Company.\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE UK VERSION OF REGULATION (EU) NO 596/2014 WHICH IS PART OF UK LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018, AS AMENDED.

As part of the transaction, a portion of fees owed to EMVCP were converted into equity, further increasing the Group's direct stake.\nProceeds from the Fundraising will support the scaling of Sofant's operations, final qualification of its first commercial products, and preparation for early customer deployments in satellite communications, defence and advanced wireless markets.\nFollowing completion of the Fundraising, the Group's fully diluted equity holding in Sofant is 1.2 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a30.6 million. This represents a c.9.3 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a30.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Sofant by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Sofant will represent 27.0 per cent. of the fully diluted share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c.\u00a313.0 million. This represents a c.10.5 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a311.8 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nThe Fundraising follows a period of strong technical and commercial momentum for Sofant. In October 2025, the company achieved a major industry breakthrough by successfully demonstrating the world's first fully functioning Ka-band transmit array using its proprietary RF MEMS beamforming IC. This milestone showcased Sofant's ability to achieve the integration of its proprietary technology into a complete transmit array, significantly reducing power consumption, size and thermal demands compared with traditional semiconductor-based systems.\nSupported by programmes with the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency, Sofant has advanced the development of its next-generation satellite communication terminal, designed to provide users with high-speed, low-latency satellite connectivity. The technology eliminates the need for complex cooling systems which is a key barrier to scaling modern SatCom and defence platforms.\nTo support the transition to a scale-up company, Sofant recently appointed Will Whitehorn OBE as Chair, who brings extensive experience in aerospace, satellite communications and commercial scaling. His appointment reflects the company's shift toward international expansion.\nDavid Wither, CEO of Sofant Technologies, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have secured this significant investment from our existing shareholder base, and to welcome NSSIF as a new strategic shareholder. This support is a testament to the disruptive potential of Sofant's technology and the remarkable progress our team has made in recent months. With this additional capital, we are positioned to accelerate our commercial deployment and redefine what is possible in wireless communications.\n\"EMVC has supported Sofant through several phases of development, and we would like to thank them for leading this round and for their continued support and guidance, along with our wider shareholder base.\"\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Sofant Investor Director, added:\n\"EMV Capital's anchoring of this pivotal funding round reflects our continued confidence in Sofant's breakthrough low-power RF MEMS technology, which we believe represents a step-change in the architecture of next-generation wireless systems, with the potential to reshape products across defence, aerospace, satellite communications and high-performance enterprise markets.\n\"This investment fits closely with our investment thesis of providing decisive hands-on support at key value inflection points of our portfolio companies, and to help attract strategic finance.\n\"We look forward to working closely with the Sofant team as they scale into global markets and unlock the significant value we believe this technology can create.\"\n-Ends-\nFor more information, please contact:\nEMV Capital plc\nvia Rosewood\nIlian Iliev, CEO\nPanmure Liberum (UK) Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Freddy Crossley / Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\nRosewood\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West /\nLlewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nAbout EMV Capital plc (EMVC)\nEMV Capital plc, is a deep tech and life sciences venture capital investment group with an international portfolio of high-growth companies.\nWith a strategic focus on generating superior returns for investors from the fast-growing sectors and technologies that will define our future; EMV Capital invests in, manages and strengthens early-stage IP-rich companies.\nEMV Capital holds both direct equity stakes and carried interest in its portfolio companies, creating an evergreen structure that supports extensive growth and value creation.

A business update on Wanda also follows.\nFundraising\nThe Fundraising was led and syndicated by EMV Capital Partners Limited (\nEMVCP\n), the Group's wholly owned venture capital and corporate finance firm. Wanda also is supported through EMV Capital's Venture Build programme.\nThe Fundraising includes \u00a30.60 million of equity investment and \u00a30.26 million through a loan facility. In addition, warrants have been exercised over shares worth \u00a30.60 million. The proceeds from the Fundraising will be used to accelerate Wanda's scale-up of operations with key customers in the US, further product development, and further execution of its commercial strategy. The additional capital will ensure Wanda can maintain its rapid execution pace while meeting rising demand for better chronic disease management and sustainable alternatives to rising drug costs in the US healthcare market.\nFollowing the completion of the Fundraising, the Group's total equity holding in Wanda is 16.5 per cent, which equates to a post-investment fair value of \u00a31.7 million. This represents a c.15 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a31.5 million at 30 June 2025.\nIn addition, following the introduction of investors to Wanda by EMVCP, the Group's third party assets under management with Wanda is 29.6 per cent. of Wanda's share capital, which equates to a post-investment fair value of c. \u00a33.1 million. This represents a c.43 per cent. increase compared to the fair value amount of \u00a32.1 million at 30 June 2025.\nThe above percentage holdings are based on fully diluted share capital excluding convertible loan arrangements.\nBusiness update\nCommercial momentum\nDuring 2025 Wanda experienced a period of significant commercial progress, driven by rising interest from US health plans, employers and PBMs, who are seeking sustainable approaches to managing cardiometabolic disease and GLP-1 medication use. Over the past year, the company has launched its GLP-1 weight-management programme, released its enhanced cardiometabolic mobile app, and deployed its new Insights Engine, which is an analytics and AI layer that transforms all platform, device and coaching data into clear, actionable insights.\nThe company has out-competed several billion-dollar competitors to win multi-million-dollar contracts, has achieved consistent double-digit month on month growth, and expects to exceed $5 million ARR by the end of 2026.\nWanda's CEO, Tom Smith, presented a detailed update on the company's commercial traction and 2026 outlook at EMV Capital's\nMeet the Portfolio\nevent. The full presentation and investor Q&A can be accessed at:\nhttps://emvcapital.com/news/media/\nMarket Outlook\nWanda operates in one of the largest and fastest-growing healthcare markets globally. Chronic conditions account for 90% of total US healthcare spend, and GLP-1 drugs have become the fastest-growing category in the market, now averaging more than $10,000 per member per year. These sectors represent multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the US alone, and the global Remote Patient Monitoring market is forecast to reach around $110.7 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 19.8% from 2025 to 2033\u00b9. With increasing demand and a platform designed for scale, Wanda is well positioned to capture long-term value in this rapidly expanding sector.\n[1 Grand View Research, \"Remote Patient Monitoring System Market Report,\" 2024.]\nAppointment of New Chair\nTo support its next stage of growth, Wanda recently appointed Michael Steel as Chair. Michael brings a unique combination of operational leadership, board experience, and healthcare scale-up expertise. He founded Greenbrook Healthcare, a respected provider of urgent care services to the NHS and grew it into a \u00a340m+ revenue organisation employing more than 700 staff.\nAs Chair, Michael will work closely with the leadership team to advance commercial execution, accelerate strategic partnerships, and support the rollout of Wanda's platform.\nDr Ilian Iliev, CEO of EMV Capital and Wanda Investment Director, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to see Wanda complete this fundraise at a time when demand for sustainable virtual-care solutions is rising sharply across the US healthcare market. Over the past year, Wanda has demonstrated strong commercial traction, a clear value proposition for payers, and the ability to compete successfully against major market leaders. We look forward to supporting Wanda through EMV Capital's Venture Build programme as it continues building scale and delivering meaningful value to healthcare systems and patients in the US and beyond.\"\n-Ends-\nFor more information, please contact:\nEMV Capital plc\nvia Rosewood\nIlian Iliev, CEO\nPanmure Liberum (UK) Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nEmma Earl / Will Goode / Freddy Crossley / Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\nRosewood\n(Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 7653 8702\nJohn West /\nLlewellyn Angus / Lily Pearce\nAbout EMV Capital plc (EMVC)\nEMV Capital plc, is a deep tech and life sciences venture capital investment group with an international portfolio of high-growth companies.\nWith a strategic focus on generating superior returns for investors from the fast-growing sectors and technologies that will define our future; EMV Capital invests in, manages and strengthens early-stage IP-rich companies.\nEMV Capital holds both direct equity stakes and carried interest in its portfolio companies, creating an evergreen structure that supports extensive growth and value creation.
