Total revenue for the three months to 31 December 2025 increased by 32% to \u00a364.6m (FY25 Q3: \u00a349.0m), reflecting strong momentum across all geographies. This broad-based growth demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy and the continued appeal of our proposition to customers.\nUK revenue increased 27% to \u00a337.8m, with our York warehouse running close to maximum capacity. As previously announced, plans are in place to expand UK-capacity in FY27 in line with our long-term strategy.\nEuropean and Rest of the World revenue increased 39% to \u00a326.8m, underlining the strength and scalability of our international platform.\nGross margin improved to 29.0% (FY25 Q3: 28.1%), reflecting ongoing pricing discipline and operational execution in improved market conditions. As a result, gross profit increased by \u00a35.0m to \u00a318.7m compared with the prior year period. The Board is encouraged by the quality of this cash-generative growth, which has translated into profitability ahead of consensus market expectations for the full financial year.\nAlongside this strong trading performance, we have continued to make progress against our long-term infrastructure plans. The Group has signed a 15-year lease for a new UK warehouse in Sherburn in Elmet near York, providing the additional capacity and efficiency required to support future UK growth. Following further review, the expected capital expenditure for the new UK automated warehouse has been re-phased, with \u00a310.2m now anticipated in FY27 and \u00a38.5m** in FY28. This re-phasing derisks project delivery and reduces the near-term financial impact and lowers anticipated borrowing requirements.\nWhile the macro-economic and consumer environment remains uncertain, the Group continues to deliver strong momentum and improving profitability, supported by a clear and disciplined strategy for sustainable growth.\nGiven the continued strength of trading and the benefits of the revised capital expenditure profile, the Board has upgraded its expectations for FY26, FY27 and FY28.\nThe Board would like to thank all our colleagues across the business for their continued commitment and hard work, which have been instrumental in delivering this performance.\n\"\n*Gear4music believes that prior to the release of this update, consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2026 are revenues of \u00a3182.5 million, EBITDA of \u00a316.7 million and profit before tax of \u00a38.3 million, and for the year ending 31 March 2027 are revenue of \u00a3188.0 million, EBITDA of \u00a314.4 million and profit before tax of \u00a34.1 million.\n**Phase 2 \u00a38.5m estimated capital expenditure is subject to final supplier negotiation and steel price variation.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive C\nhair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel\nAnastassiya Eley\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma Strategic Communications - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nSarah Peters\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.com\nAbout Gear4music\n(Holdings) plc\nGear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and music equipment in the UK, delivering to 190 countries across Europe and the Rest of the World.\nThe Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals.\nOperating from a Head Office in York, the Group has Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platform, with multilingual, multicurrency websites, the Group continues to build its overseas presence.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\").

Total revenue for the three months to 31 December 2025 increased by 32% to \u00a364.6m (FY25 Q3: \u00a349.0m), reflecting strong momentum across all geographies. This broad-based growth demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy and the continued appeal of our proposition to customers.\nUK revenue increased 27% to \u00a337.8m, with our York warehouse running close to maximum capacity. As previously announced, plans are in place to expand UK-capacity in FY27 in line with our long-term strategy.\nEuropean and Rest of the World revenue increased 39% to \u00a326.8m, underlining the strength and scalability of our international platform.\nGross margin improved to 29.0% (FY25 Q3: 28.1%), reflecting ongoing pricing discipline and operational execution in improved market conditions. As a result, gross profit increased by \u00a35.0m to \u00a318.7m compared with the prior year period. The Board is encouraged by the quality of this cash-generative growth, which has translated into profitability ahead of consensus market expectations for the full financial year.\nAlongside this strong trading performance, we have continued to make progress against our long-term infrastructure plans. The Group has signed a 15-year lease for a new UK warehouse in Sherburn in Elmet near York, providing the additional capacity and efficiency required to support future UK growth. Following further review, the expected capital expenditure for the new UK automated warehouse has been re-phased, with \u00a310.2m now anticipated in FY27 and \u00a38.5m** in FY28. This re-phasing derisks project delivery and reduces the near-term financial impact and lowers anticipated borrowing requirements.\nWhile the macro-economic and consumer environment remains uncertain, the Group continues to deliver strong momentum and improving profitability, supported by a clear and disciplined strategy for sustainable growth.\nGiven the continued strength of trading and the benefits of the revised capital expenditure profile, the Board has upgraded its expectations for FY26, FY27 and FY28.\nThe Board would like to thank all our colleagues across the business for their continued commitment and hard work, which have been instrumental in delivering this performance.\n\"\n*Gear4music believes that prior to the release of this update, consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2026 are revenues of \u00a3182.5 million, EBITDA of \u00a316.7 million and profit before tax of \u00a38.3 million, and for the year ending 31 March 2027 are revenue of \u00a3188.0 million, EBITDA of \u00a314.4 million and profit before tax of \u00a34.1 million.\n**Phase 2 \u00a38.5m estimated capital expenditure is subject to final supplier negotiation and steel price variation.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive C\nhair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel\nAnastassiya Eley\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma Strategic Communications - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nSarah Peters\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.com\nAbout Gear4music\n(Holdings) plc\nGear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and music equipment in the UK, delivering to 190 countries across Europe and the Rest of the World.\nThe Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium",

Group revenues for Q1 FY26, covering the three months to 30 June 2025, were 27% ahead of Q1 FY25, with traction continuing in Q2 FY26 to date.\nThis performance reflects the positive impact of our refreshed Growth Strategy, which is delivering tangible results. As previously announced, this is supported by a more favourable competitive landscape across both our UK and European markets, allowing the Group to successfully capture additional market share.\nWhile it remains early in the financial year and the critical peak trading period is yet to come, strong trading in the year to date provides the Board with sufficient confidence to once again increase its expectations for the Group's financial performance for the year ending 31 March 2026, following the uplift to expectations announced in June 2025.\nThe Group will issue a trading update for the six months to 30 September 2025 on 21 October 2025, followed by publication of half-year results on 18 November 2025.\"\n* Gear4music believes that consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2026 prior to release of this announcement were revenues of \u00a3155.8 million, EBITDA of \u00a311.3 million and profit before tax of \u00a33.0 million.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive Chair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Sole Broker\nPeter Steel/Sam Butcher, Corporate Finance\nTom Salvesen, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma Strategic Communications - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nSarah Peters\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.com\nAbout Gear4music\n(Holdings) plc\nOperating from a Head Office in York, Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany, the Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals, in the UK, Europe and the Rest of the World.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platform, with multilingual, multicurrency websites delivering to over 190 countries, the Group continues to build its overseas presence.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\").

Our performance reflects higher revenues, stable gross margins and a continued focus on cost control resulting in increased reported EBITDA, and a \u00a31.0m improvement in Profit Before Tax for the year. A further reduction in net bank debt translates into leverage of x0.6 times FY25 EBITDA (FY24: x0.8 times).\nFinancial performance in February and early March 2025 was subdued, primarily due to aggressive discounting from underperforming competitors in both the UK and Europe coupled with ongoing weak consumer confidence. However, both UK and European like-for-like (LFL) sales improved markedly in the latter half of March, with early indications suggesting that the competitive pressures may be easing as a result of a number of significant retailers experiencing trading difficulties and now exiting the market.\nThrough FY25, we have laid robust foundations for our revised growth strategy first announced in June 2024, by investing in new own-brand products, expanding our second-hand offerings, strengthening our marketing capabilities, and enhancing our bespoke e-commerce platform. Economic uncertainty remains as we enter the new financial year, nevertheless we believe these strategic initiatives coupled with competitor developments in our market, position us well to maintain our recent positive momentum and drive accelerated commercial and financial performance in FY26 and beyond.\"\n- Ends -\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive C\nhair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel/Sam Butcher, Corporate Finance\nTom Salvesen, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nDavid Ison\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.com\nAbout Gear4music\n(Holdings) plc\nOperating from a Head Office in York, Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany, the Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Yamaha, Roland and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals, in the UK, Europe and the Rest of the World.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platform, with multilingual, multicurrency websites delivering to over 190 countries, the Group continues to build its overseas presence.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\").

While the recent UK budget will introduce additional employment costs from FY26 onwards estimated at \u00a30.3m, we are confident these can be largely mitigated through further cost-saving measures.\nOur second-hand sales platform continued to gain significant traction during FY25 H1, with sales growing by 286% to \u00a31.4m in the Period. We anticipate sustained strong growth in this area as we expand consumer awareness and our channels to market.\nOur long-term focus remains on growing higher-margin revenues, and we will continue to invest in areas that support this objective, such as the Studiospares acquisition announced on 22 October 2024, our second-hand platform, and our own-brand product offering, teams and infrastructure.\nOur full-year outlook remains in-line with consensus market expectations, we are well prepared for our seasonal peak trading period, and look forward to providing a further trading update after the Christmas period on 21 January 2025.\"\n** Gear4music believes that current consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2025 are revenues of \u00a3\n154.7 million, EBITDA of \u00a311.7 million and profit before tax of \u00a32.8 million\n.\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive Chair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel/Sam Butcher, Corporate Finance\nTom Salvesen, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma Strategic Communications - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nDavid Ison\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.co.uk\nAbout Gear4music\n.com\nGear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and music equipment in the UK, delivering to 190 countries across Europe and the Rest of the World.\nThe Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals.\nOperating from a Head Office in York, the Group has Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce pl",

We are also pleased to have further reduced our Net Debt, and improved our overall profitability compared with the same period last year.\nThis performance comes despite initial challenges with the rollout of a new AI-based marketing system during H1, which temporarily increased marketing costs and impacted the sales mix between our own-brand and other-brand products and our European sales. These issues have now been resolved, and our marketing investments have stabilised. I am also pleased to report the recent appointment of a new experienced Marketing Director.\nAdditionally, we recently acquired the brand and certain assets of Studiospares, a business established in 1983 with a strong reputation for high-quality studio equipment and accessories. We are excited to integrate Studiospares's brand offering into our existing own-brand portfolio, which will support our long-term objective of product margin growth.\nOur second-hand sales platform gained significant traction during FY25 H1, and we anticipate continued growth in this area as we build upon our unique offering.\nAs we enter our peak trading season, which has historically been a key driver of our profits and revenues, the Board is confident that our full-year outlook remains in-line with consensus market expectations.\"\nThe Group will report Interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2024 on 19 November 2024.\n* In FY24 H1, adjusted EBITDA and LBT excluded \u00a30.5m one-off redundancy costs.\n** Gear4music believes that current consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2025 are revenue of \u00a3154.7 million, EBITDA of \u00a311.7 million and profit before tax of \u00a32.8 million.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive Chair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel/Sam Butcher, Corporate Finance\nTom Salvesen, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma Strategic Communications - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nDavid Ison\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almas\ntrategic\n.com\nAbout Gear4music\n(Holdings) plc\nOperating from a Head Office in York, Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany, the Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals, in the UK, Europe and the Rest of the World.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platf",

This will focus on expanding sales verticals and channels to market whilst further enhancing and leveraging our unique bespoke e-commerce platform and product offering.\nInternational revenue growth faced some localised challenges in FY24; however, the Board is confident that, through our ongoing actions and new initiatives, such as our second-hand proposition, European sales are set to start recovering in FY25.\nThe cost reductions implemented through FY24 are now delivering full-year benefits as we commence FY25. Alongside this, based on trading performance since our last update in April, the Board remains confident in delivering further improvements in financial performance during FY25 in line with market expectations.\"\n** Gear4music believes that, prior to publication of this announcement, current consensus market expectations (i) for the year ended 31 March 2024 were revenue of \u00a3144.2 million, adjusted EBITDA of \u00a39.8 million, adjusted profit before tax of \u00a31.3 million, and pre-IFRS16 net debt of \u00a39.4 million; and (ii) for the year ending 31 March 2025 were revenue of \u00a3154.8 million, EBITDA of \u00a311.8 million, profit before tax of \u00a32.8 million, and pre-IFRS16 net debt of \u00a36.6 million.

In FY24 H1 EBITDA adjusted for \u00a30.5m one-off redundancy costs (FY23 H1: \u00a3nil).\nFY24 H1 Highlights:\n-\nResults reflect delivery against previously stated prioritisation of improved gross margins and reduced costs over sales growth in a continuing challenging retail environment, particularly in our European markets:\no\nA 6% decline in revenue resulted from a planned focus on prioritising gross margins which improved by 80bps, with the Group benefiting from an improved stock profile and lower delivery costs in FY24 H1; and\no\nCost reduction initiatives to achieve \u00a34.0m of annualised cash savings were delivered in FY24 H1, with the benefit from FY24 H2 onwards - associated one-off exceptional cost of \u00a30.5m.\n-\nGood progress against the objective of reducing Group net debt to \u00a318.1m, \u00a33.7m lower than last year (30 September 2022: \u00a321.8m), representing a high-point in the annual cash cycle as the business starts to build stock ahead of the peak trading period.\n-\nSecond Hand system continues to show good potential following European launch during FY24 H1.\n-\nWell prepared ahead of the seasonal peak trading period, with a continuing focus on efficiency and margin improvements\n.\nTrading Outlook:\n\u00b7\nWhilst profit expectations remain the same, we are moderating our revenue expectation for the year to \u00a3144m, to reflect sales run rates and the actions taken to prioritise profits over growth. This has been offset by an increase in gross margins and lower costs contributing to higher overall profit margins. As such, full-year adjusted/underlying profit outlook remains in-line with current consensus market expectations**.\n\u00b7\nNet debt and on-hand inventory expected to be further reduced by 31 March 2024.\nCommenting on the results, Andrew Wass, Chief Executive Officer said:\n\"We are pleased to have made good progress during the period against our strategic objectives of increasing gross margins, reducing our cost base, and further enhancing our customer proposition with the launch of our Second-Hand system in Europe.\nAlthough consumer demand has remained subdued this year due to the weaker environment, our FY24 H1 revenues were 27% higher than our pre-Covid FY20 H1 revenues, and we remain confident in our long-term growth strategy.\nThe decisive actions we have taken will ensure the business can return to stronger profitable growth by the next financial year, as we leverage efficiencies driven by AI, build upon our platform for growth, and diversify our channels to market.\nWe are well prepared for our seasonal peak trading period with a range of recently developed great value music products, and we look forward to providing a further trading update after Christmas on the 18 January 2024.\"\n** Gear4music believes that current consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2024 prior to the publication of this announcement are revenues of \u00a3\n161.7 million, adjusted EBITDA of \u00a39.8 million and adjusted profit before tax of \u00a31.2 million\n.\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel/Sam Butcher, Corporate Finance\nTom Salvesen, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nDavid Ison\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.co.uk\nAbout Gear4music\n.com\nOperating from a Head Office in York, Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany, the Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals, in the UK, Europe and the Rest of the World.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platform, with multilingual, multicurrency websites delivering to over 190 countries, the Group continues to build its overseas presence.\nThis announcement ",

There is no reason for G4M\u2019s market share to change much one way or the other.  Even the UK\u2019s main bricks and mortar retailer in the sector (PMT) has returned to its pre Covid sales level so there is no evidence of online retailers increasing their market share rapidly.  AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt. No reason for the market to change its valuation.",

That they have said they have had to discount some to shift it suggests that they haven\u2019t just accelerated buying strong selling lines but have taken risks on a significant amount of lines without strong sales history and got their fingers burnt.

The 2023 scheme for management replaces the 2018 and 2021 schemes.  The 2018 target for the share price at the end of FY2026 was \u00a335, amended to \u00a317 in October 2020.  It\u2019s now \u00a33. In 2021 the target fully diluted EPS for FY25 was 61p.  The current forecast from Progressive Research is 9.3p. The fundamental structure of the markets they are in hasn\u2019t changed much in the last five years. Even \u00a33 seems challenging.  Their online musical instruments retail business would seem to be mature with the website developed and the own brand stocking model being in place but it\u2019s not making profit. Until at least 22 June they had Liontrust Investment Partners buying shares effectively supporting a \u00a31 per share price.  Without that support this still looks overvalued.  In FY23 sales of \u00a3150m generated no profit for shareholders.  Where is the profit going to come from?  Can they carve out large costs and still sustain the business?  A mature business that cannot generate profit in normal trading years has little value.",

So if they manage to suggest to you that the product you are buying (x) goes well with something else (y) all you need to do is open another tab and find who is selling product y the cheapest and buy it from them.  No need to buy x and y from the same retailer.  No need to walk a mile to see how much someone else is selling it for, its just a few clicks away. An online retailer doesn\u2019t get to talk to the customer face to face so they are very difficult to influence, very difficult to affect the sales lifetime value.  Almost everything is dominated by price (if you and your competitors are competent in customer delivery). They bought av.com as their \u2018platform supports multiple verticals\u2019.  They have said very little about it but Progressive Research think its off to a slow start.  Almost whatever area they more into they will be up against others with developed online retail platforms so will find it no easier that musical instrument retail. Bar cutting costs I don\u2019t know how they produce profit for shareholders.

They also paid \u00a32.516m goodwill for the av.com business. Revenue by product category is given on page 2 of the FY23 accounts.  AV.com will be in the \u2018Other\u2019 category of 4% of turnover (FY22 3%).  The FY22 accounts split this 'other' category into \u2018Home Audio & Visual\u2019 2% and \u2018other\u2019 1%.  From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.  In the last full year under its previous ownership sales were in excess of \u00a38m, so I don\u2019t expect G4M to be highlighting it in their reports. With the av.com website offering nothing that their established online competitors don\u2019t also offer I would expect progress at av.com to be slow.",

They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin.

They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable. They should be excellently positioned to benefit from the whole AI toolkit to generate sales over the coming years. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

          "content": "Lol, can't say I've ever had 3 accounts parrot any post of mine,  bit weird. I also found the posting history of 'killerjoe' very odd. Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

Everyone feels more comfortable having cash in reserve, which just adds to the sell off and exaggerates SP movements. 180 has been the floor here a few times over the last few years, but it's dipping below that now, which shows the angst of the market.

This is patently untrue as SPs usually rise  higher definitely in the long term...maybe in your experience your shares haven't risen to where they were but that maybe the shares you have bought have not been with good companies ( everyone has cases like that) or you haven't held onto them long enough. I have certain shares that I trade in on the basis that if they drop below a certain price in will buy knowing that they will be back and they always do..maybe I'll get caught one day but I'll have made enough over the years to cover a loss.

Richer Sounds (UK market leader in the AV.com target market) says in its accounts to April 22 in a report dated 16 Dec 22 that \u201csince the year end macro-economic conditions have worsened and retail spend has slowed down further\u201d.  So the av.com results and short term prospects maybe unspectacular. The acquisition struck me as G4M not expecting rapid sales growth in their traditional market. Av.com sales would be included in the Q3 2022/3 figures but not in the comparatives.  Under the last year of its previous ownership AV Distribution UK sales were c\u00a38m, so G4M like for like UK sales will have fallen a bit despite inflation. It looks fairly secure but flat.",

Even the UK\u2019s main bricks and mortar retailer in the sector (PMT) has returned to its pre Covid sales level so there is no evidence of online retailers increasing their market share rapidly.  AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt. No reason for the market to change its valuation.",

But making nothing on \u00a3150m sales seems a particularly poor performance especially when there are no real exceptional items.

That they have said they have had to discount some to shift it suggests that they haven\u2019t just accelerated buying strong selling lines but have taken risks on a significant amount of lines without strong sales history and got their fingers burnt.  Poor buying? Unless we can find out the results of their main competitors for the same period we can\u2019t tell if online musical instruments retail has become a low profit game or if G4M are just not particularly good at it.",

So if they manage to suggest to you that the product you are buying (x) goes well with something else (y) all you need to do is open another tab and find who is selling product y the cheapest and buy it from them.  No need to buy x and y from the same retailer.  No need to walk a mile to see how much someone else is selling it for, its just a few clicks away. An online retailer doesn\u2019t get to talk to the customer face to face so they are very difficult to influence, very difficult to affect the sales lifetime value.  Almost everything is dominated by price (if you and your competitors are competent in customer delivery). They bought av.com as their \u2018platform supports multiple verticals\u2019.  They have said very little about it but Progressive Research think its off to a slow start.  Almost whatever area they more into they will be up against others with developed online retail platforms so will find it no easier that musical instrument retail. Bar cutting costs I don\u2019t know how they produce profit for shareholders.  This kind of online retail isn\u2019t as profitable as it was a few years ago when most of your competitors had physical shops to support.

From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.

They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin.

They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable.

I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

Not that the forecasts are terribly good, showing for FY24 and FY25 combined turnover of \u00a3335m generating a small net profit of \u00a34.1m.  This turnover growth is not much more than inflationary and, once av.com and the second hand stuff are taken into account, probably shows no growth for the core online MI retail market.  The days of high growth rates are over.  (There is plenty to go at \u2013 market leader Thomann is likely turning over in excess of \u20ac1 billion \u2013 but G4M has no real competitive advantage to make inroads.  Online MI retail seems to have reached maturity.) That being the case G4M needs to make money out of the business its already doing.  It seems to be making progress but isn\u2019t talking about being ahead of the very modest profit levels in the forecast. The statement says that they have been \u201cdriving significant cost efficiencies in out software development unit\u201d.  Their comparatively high spend on this has always been promoted as a competitive advantage for G4M.  Reducing it suggests that the real beneficial work on software development has been done and its benefits are already largely in the figures and forecasts. While today\u2019s statement is positive it is still difficult to see where a real increase in profits or opportunities are coming from to increase the market valuation in the short term.

A \u00a320m market cap with depreciation adjusted profit before tax of \u00a37-10m and a bit of debt which could be paid off by normalising inventory (\u00a334m at year end) back to pre covid levels (\u00a322m).

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

I've already 'covered' a portion of the cost of the guitar here :-) Before your comments I sold all my scancell (only a few \u00a3100s) at a profit and could now nearly buy them back again despite the fees. The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed. 'Talk' soon no doubt!",

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

This one has attractions because it has demonstrated a tendency to race much higher, very quickly, more than once. Economic outlook seems the grimmest it's been for a long time, analysts obviously see very difficult times ahead. Everyone feels more comfortable having cash in reserve, which just adds to the sell off and exaggerates SP movements. 180 has been the floor here a few times over the last few years, but it's dipping below that now, which shows the angst of the market. I'd be surprised if this is the bottom, but historically it seems likes a good time to buy.",

I have certain shares that I trade in on the basis that if they drop below a certain price in will buy knowing that they will be back and they always do..maybe I'll get caught one day but I'll have made enough over the years to cover a loss.

So the av.com results and short term prospects maybe unspectacular. The acquisition struck me as G4M not expecting rapid sales growth in their traditional market. Av.com sales would be included in the Q3 2022/3 figures but not in the comparatives.  Under the last year of its previous ownership AV Distribution UK sales were c\u00a38m, so G4M like for like UK sales will have fallen a bit despite inflation. It looks fairly secure but flat.",

The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

The bottom Bollinger band may in the future stop going down and join the upper Bollinger band in going up, at which time there may be an equity retracement, to reflect the reduction in volatility. There is no overhead supply from previous trading volume in the last two years, so resistance from stale selling is minimal. DYOR.",

          "content": "Lol, can't say I've ever had 3 accounts parrot any post of mine,  bit weird. I also found the posting history of 'killerjoe' very odd. Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

A \u00a320m market cap with depreciation adjusted profit before tax of \u00a37-10m and a bit of debt which could be paid off by normalising inventory (\u00a334m at year end) back to pre covid levels (\u00a322m).

Not that the forecasts are terribly good, showing for FY24 and FY25 combined turnover of \u00a3335m generating a small net profit of \u00a34.1m.  This turnover growth is not much more than inflationary and, once av.com and the second hand stuff are taken into account, probably shows no growth for the core online MI retail market.  The days of high growth rates are over.  (There is plenty to go at \u2013 market leader Thomann is likely turning over in excess of \u20ac1 billion \u2013 but G4M has no real competitive advantage to make inroads.  Online MI retail seems to have reached maturity.) That being the case G4M needs to make money out of the business its already doing.  It seems to be making progress but isn\u2019t talking about being ahead of the very modest profit levels in the forecast. The statement says that they have been \u201cdriving significant cost efficiencies in out software development unit\u201d.  Their comparatively high spend on this has always been promoted as a competitive advantage for G4M.  Reducing it suggests that the real beneficial work on software development has been done and its benefits are already largely in the figures and forecasts. While today\u2019s statement is positive it is still difficult to see where a real increase in profits or opportunities are coming from to increase the market valuation in the short term.

They\u2019ve got a large in-house development team, 50+ people compared to some other listed retailers who have a handful or less. They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin. OK, they need to improve on 5% EBITDA off \u00a3150m sales, but at a sub \u00a320m valuation, this is well in the buying zone for me. They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable. They should be excellently positioned to benefit from the whole AI toolkit to generate sales over the coming years. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

To date only the UK and German website are up and running so too early to say how much its worth (although with Go Daddy currently advertising \u2018av.tech\u2019 and \u2018av.store\u2019 at \u00a35141 pa, \u00a33m does seem pricey).  They also paid \u00a32.516m goodwill for the av.com business. Revenue by product category is given on page 2 of the FY23 accounts.  AV.com will be in the \u2018Other\u2019 category of 4% of turnover (FY22 3%).  The FY22 accounts split this 'other' category into \u2018Home Audio & Visual\u2019 2% and \u2018other\u2019 1%.  From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.  In the last full year under its previous ownership sales were in excess of \u00a38m, so I don\u2019t expect G4M to be highlighting it in their reports. With the av.com website offering nothing that their established online competitors don\u2019t also offer I would expect progress at av.com to be slow.",

So if they manage to suggest to you that the product you are buying (x) goes well with something else (y) all you need to do is open another tab and find who is selling product y the cheapest and buy it from them.  No need to buy x and y from the same retailer.  No need to walk a mile to see how much someone else is selling it for, its just a few clicks away. An online retailer doesn\u2019t get to talk to the customer face to face so they are very difficult to influence, very difficult to affect the sales lifetime value.  Almost everything is dominated by price (if you and your competitors are competent in customer delivery). They bought av.com as their \u2018platform supports multiple verticals\u2019.  They have said very little about it but Progressive Research think its off to a slow start.  Almost whatever area they more into they will be up against others with developed online retail platforms so will find it no easier that musical instrument retail. Bar cutting costs I don\u2019t know how they produce profit for shareholders.  This kind of online retail isn\u2019t as profitable as it was a few years ago when most of your competitors had physical shops to support.

G4M don't have the finances for a price war so growth at av.com likely to be slow. Net debt down and manageable but could be thin gruel for shareholders for some time.",

There is no reason for G4M\u2019s market share to change much one way or the other.  Even the UK\u2019s main bricks and mortar retailer in the sector (PMT) has returned to its pre Covid sales level so there is no evidence of online retailers increasing their market share rapidly.  AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt. No reason for the market to change its valuation.",

I've already 'covered' a portion of the cost of the guitar here :-) Before your comments I sold all my scancell (only a few \u00a3100s) at a profit and could now nearly buy them back again despite the fees. The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

I'll post a full response in due course, however the biggest error you make is assuming that AIM is efficient and that the current \u00a320m market cap is pricing G4M anywhere near accurately... A \u00a320m market cap with depreciation adjusted profit before tax of \u00a37-10m and a bit of debt which could be paid off by normalising inventory (\u00a334m at year end) back to pre covid levels (\u00a322m). The market has been pricing this to go bust, it very much looks like it's doing well, so it should move up strongly as the threat of debt covenants etc is removed from the share price.",

Not that the forecasts are terribly good, showing for FY24 and FY25 combined turnover of \u00a3335m generating a small net profit of \u00a34.1m.  This turnover growth is not much more than inflationary and, once av.com and the second hand stuff are taken into account, probably shows no growth for the core online MI retail market.  The days of high growth rates are over.  (There is plenty to go at \u2013 market leader Thomann is likely turning over in excess of \u20ac1 billion \u2013 but G4M has no real competitive advantage to make inroads.  Online MI retail seems to have reached maturity.) That being the case G4M needs to make money out of the business its already doing.  It seems to be making progress but isn\u2019t talking about being ahead of the very modest profit levels in the forecast. The statement says that they have been \u201cdriving significant cost efficiencies in out software development unit\u201d.  Their comparatively high spend on this has always been promoted as a competitive advantage for G4M.  Reducing it suggests that the real beneficial work on software development has been done and its benefits are already largely in the figures and forecasts. While today\u2019s statement is positive it is still difficult to see where a real increase in profits or opportunities are coming from to increase the market valuation in the short term.

They\u2019ve got a large in-house development team, 50+ people compared to some other listed retailers who have a handful or less. They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin. OK, they need to improve on 5% EBITDA off \u00a3150m sales, but at a sub \u00a320m valuation, this is well in the buying zone for me. They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable. They should be excellently positioned to benefit from the whole AI toolkit to generate sales over the coming years. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

To date only the UK and German website are up and running so too early to say how much its worth (although with Go Daddy currently advertising \u2018av.tech\u2019 and \u2018av.store\u2019 at \u00a35141 pa, \u00a33m does seem pricey).  They also paid \u00a32.516m goodwill for the av.com business. Revenue by product category is given on page 2 of the FY23 accounts.  AV.com will be in the \u2018Other\u2019 category of 4% of turnover (FY22 3%).  The FY22 accounts split this 'other' category into \u2018Home Audio & Visual\u2019 2% and \u2018other\u2019 1%.  From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.  In the last full year under its previous ownership sales were in excess of \u00a38m, so I don\u2019t expect G4M to be highlighting it in their reports. With the av.com website offering nothing that their established online competitors don\u2019t also offer I would expect progress at av.com to be slow.",

Online shopping is so much less hassle than bricks and mortar shopping making it much easier to shop around.  So if they manage to suggest to you that the product you are buying (x) goes well with something else (y) all you need to do is open another tab and find who is selling product y the cheapest and buy it from them.  No need to buy x and y from the same retailer.  No need to walk a mile to see how much someone else is selling it for, its just a few clicks away. An online retailer doesn\u2019t get to talk to the customer face to face so they are very difficult to influence, very difficult to affect the sales lifetime value.  Almost everything is dominated by price (if you and your competitors are competent in customer delivery). They bought av.com as their \u2018platform supports multiple verticals\u2019.  They have said very little about it but Progressive Research think its off to a slow start.  Almost whatever area they more into they will be up against others with developed online retail platforms so will find it no easier that musical instrument retail. Bar cutting costs I don\u2019t know how they produce profit for shareholders.  This kind of online retail isn\u2019t as profitable as it was a few years ago when most of your competitors had physical shops to support.

AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt.

I've already 'covered' a portion of the cost of the guitar here :-) Before your comments I sold all my scancell (only a few \u00a3100s) at a profit and could now nearly buy them back again despite the fees. The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

A \u00a320m market cap with depreciation adjusted profit before tax of \u00a37-10m and a bit of debt which could be paid off by normalising inventory (\u00a334m at year end) back to pre covid levels (\u00a322m). The market has been pricing this to go bust, it very much looks like it's doing well, so it should move up strongly as the threat of debt covenants etc is removed from the share price.",

Not that the forecasts are terribly good, showing for FY24 and FY25 combined turnover of \u00a3335m generating a small net profit of \u00a34.1m.  This turnover growth is not much more than inflationary and, once av.com and the second hand stuff are taken into account, probably shows no growth for the core online MI retail market.  The days of high growth rates are over.  (There is plenty to go at \u2013 market leader Thomann is likely turning over in excess of \u20ac1 billion \u2013 but G4M has no real competitive advantage to make inroads.  Online MI retail seems to have reached maturity.) That being the case G4M needs to make money out of the business its already doing.  It seems to be making progress but isn\u2019t talking about being ahead of the very modest profit levels in the forecast. The statement says that they have been \u201cdriving significant cost efficiencies in out software development unit\u201d.  Their comparatively high spend on this has always been promoted as a competitive advantage for G4M.  Reducing it suggests that the real beneficial work on software development has been done and its benefits are already largely in the figures and forecasts. While today\u2019s statement is positive it is still difficult to see where a real increase in profits or opportunities are coming from to increase the market valuation in the short term.  Share price will probably drift around current levels.",

They\u2019ve got a large in-house development team, 50+ people compared to some other listed retailers who have a handful or less. They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin. OK, they need to improve on 5% EBITDA off \u00a3150m sales, but at a sub \u00a320m valuation, this is well in the buying zone for me. They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable. They should be excellently positioned to benefit from the whole AI toolkit to generate sales over the coming years. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

To date only the UK and German website are up and running so too early to say how much its worth (although with Go Daddy currently advertising \u2018av.tech\u2019 and \u2018av.store\u2019 at \u00a35141 pa, \u00a33m does seem pricey).  They also paid \u00a32.516m goodwill for the av.com business. Revenue by product category is given on page 2 of the FY23 accounts.  AV.com will be in the \u2018Other\u2019 category of 4% of turnover (FY22 3%).  The FY22 accounts split this 'other' category into \u2018Home Audio & Visual\u2019 2% and \u2018other\u2019 1%.  From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.  In the last full year under its previous ownership sales were in excess of \u00a38m, so I don\u2019t expect G4M to be highlighting it in their reports. With the av.com website offering nothing that their established online competitors don\u2019t also offer I would expect progress at av.com to be slow.",

So, unless one can get into a monopolistic position, we shouldn\u2019t really expect much profit.  But making nothing on \u00a3150m sales seems a particularly poor performance especially when there are no real exceptional items. They talk about having to increase stock early in the period due to shipping delays.  In an inflationary environment buying early should increase reported margin.  That they have said they have had to discount some to shift it suggests that they haven\u2019t just accelerated buying strong selling lines but have taken risks on a significant amount of lines without strong sales history and got their fingers burnt.  Poor buying? Unless we can find out the results of their main competitors for the same period we can\u2019t tell if online musical instruments retail has become a low profit game or if G4M are just not particularly good at it.",

There is no reason for G4M\u2019s market share to change much one way or the other.  Even the UK\u2019s main bricks and mortar retailer in the sector (PMT) has returned to its pre Covid sales level so there is no evidence of online retailers increasing their market share rapidly.  AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt. No reason for the market to change its valuation.",

The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

The bottom Bollinger band may in the future stop going down and join the upper Bollinger band in going up, at which time there may be an equity retracement, to reflect the reduction in volatility.

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

A \u00a320m market cap with depreciation adjusted profit before tax of \u00a37-10m and a bit of debt which could be paid off by normalising inventory (\u00a334m at year end) back to pre covid levels (\u00a322m).

This turnover growth is not much more than inflationary and, once av.com and the second hand stuff are taken into account, probably shows no growth for the core online MI retail market.  The days of high growth rates are over.  (There is plenty to go at \u2013 market leader Thomann is likely turning over in excess of \u20ac1 billion \u2013 but G4M has no real competitive advantage to make inroads.  Online MI retail seems to have reached maturity.) That being the case G4M needs to make money out of the business its already doing.  It seems to be making progress but isn\u2019t talking about being ahead of the very modest profit levels in the forecast. The statement says that they have been \u201cdriving significant cost efficiencies in out software development unit\u201d.  Their comparatively high spend on this has always been promoted as a competitive advantage for G4M.  Reducing it suggests that the real beneficial work on software development has been done and its benefits are already largely in the figures and forecasts. While today\u2019s statement is positive it is still difficult to see where a real increase in profits or opportunities are coming from to increase the market valuation in the short term.

They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin. OK, they need to improve on 5% EBITDA off \u00a3150m sales, but at a sub \u00a320m valuation, this is well in the buying zone for me. They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable. They should be excellently positioned to benefit from the whole AI toolkit to generate sales over the coming years. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

To date only the UK and German website are up and running so too early to say how much its worth (although with Go Daddy currently advertising \u2018av.tech\u2019 and \u2018av.store\u2019 at \u00a35141 pa, \u00a33m does seem pricey).  They also paid \u00a32.516m goodwill for the av.com business. Revenue by product category is given on page 2 of the FY23 accounts.  AV.com will be in the \u2018Other\u2019 category of 4% of turnover (FY22 3%).  The FY22 accounts split this 'other' category into \u2018Home Audio & Visual\u2019 2% and \u2018other\u2019 1%.  From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.  In the last full year under its previous ownership sales were in excess of \u00a38m, so I don\u2019t expect G4M to be highlighting it in their reports. With the av.com website offering nothing that their established online competitors don\u2019t also offer I would expect progress at av.com to be slow.",

So if they manage to suggest to you that the product you are buying (x) goes well with something else (y) all you need to do is open another tab and find who is selling product y the cheapest and buy it from them.  No need to buy x and y from the same retailer.  No need to walk a mile to see how much someone else is selling it for, its just a few clicks away. An online retailer doesn\u2019t get to talk to the customer face to face so they are very difficult to influence, very difficult to affect the sales lifetime value.  Almost everything is dominated by price (if you and your competitors are competent in customer delivery). They bought av.com as their \u2018platform supports multiple verticals\u2019.  They have said very little about it but Progressive Research think its off to a slow start.  Almost whatever area they more into they will be up against others with developed online retail platforms so will find it no easier that musical instrument retail. Bar cutting costs I don\u2019t know how they produce profit for shareholders.  This kind of online retail isn\u2019t as profitable as it was a few years ago when most of your competitors had physical shops to support.

There is no reason for G4M\u2019s market share to change much one way or the other.  Even the UK\u2019s main bricks and mortar retailer in the sector (PMT) has returned to its pre Covid sales level so there is no evidence of online retailers increasing their market share rapidly.  AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt. No reason for the market to change its valuation.",

I've already 'covered' a portion of the cost of the guitar here :-) Before your comments I sold all my scancell (only a few \u00a3100s) at a profit and could now nearly buy them back again despite the fees. The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

A \u00a320m market cap with depreciation adjusted profit before tax of \u00a37-10m and a bit of debt which could be paid off by normalising inventory (\u00a334m at year end) back to pre covid levels (\u00a322m).

Not that the forecasts are terribly good, showing for FY24 and FY25 combined turnover of \u00a3335m generating a small net profit of \u00a34.1m.  This turnover growth is not much more than inflationary and, once av.com and the second hand stuff are taken into account, probably shows no growth for the core online MI retail market.  The days of high growth rates are over.  (There is plenty to go at \u2013 market leader Thomann is likely turning over in excess of \u20ac1 billion \u2013 but G4M has no real competitive advantage to make inroads.  Online MI retail seems to have reached maturity.) That being the case G4M needs to make money out of the business its already doing.  It seems to be making progress but isn\u2019t talking about being ahead of the very modest profit levels in the forecast. The statement says that they have been \u201cdriving significant cost efficiencies in out software development unit\u201d.  Their comparatively high spend on this has always been promoted as a competitive advantage for G4M.  Reducing it suggests that the real beneficial work on software development has been done and its benefits are already largely in the figures and forecasts. While today\u2019s statement is positive it is still difficult to see where a real increase in profits or opportunities are coming from to increase the market valuation in the short term.

They\u2019ve got a large in-house development team, 50+ people compared to some other listed retailers who have a handful or less. They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin. OK, they need to improve on 5% EBITDA off \u00a3150m sales, but at a sub \u00a320m valuation, this is well in the buying zone for me. They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable. They should be excellently positioned to benefit from the whole AI toolkit to generate sales over the coming years. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

To date only the UK and German website are up and running so too early to say how much its worth (although with Go Daddy currently advertising \u2018av.tech\u2019 and \u2018av.store\u2019 at \u00a35141 pa, \u00a33m does seem pricey).  They also paid \u00a32.516m goodwill for the av.com business. Revenue by product category is given on page 2 of the FY23 accounts.  AV.com will be in the \u2018Other\u2019 category of 4% of turnover (FY22 3%).  The FY22 accounts split this 'other' category into \u2018Home Audio & Visual\u2019 2% and \u2018other\u2019 1%.  From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.  In the last full year under its previous ownership sales were in excess of \u00a38m, so I don\u2019t expect G4M to be highlighting it in their reports. With the av.com website offering nothing that their established online competitors don\u2019t also offer I would expect progress at av.com to be slow.",

In 2021 the target fully diluted EPS for FY25 was 61p.  The current forecast from Progressive Research is 9.3p. The fundamental structure of the markets they are in hasn\u2019t changed much in the last five years. Even \u00a33 seems challenging.  Their online musical instruments retail business would seem to be mature with the website developed and the own brand stocking model being in place but it\u2019s not making profit. Until at least 22 June they had Liontrust Investment Partners buying shares effectively supporting a \u00a31 per share price.  Without that support this still looks overvalued.  In FY23 sales of \u00a3150m generated no profit for shareholders.  Where is the profit going to come from?  Can they carve out large costs and still sustain the business?  A mature business that cannot generate profit in normal trading years has little value.",

That they have said they have had to discount some to shift it suggests that they haven\u2019t just accelerated buying strong selling lines but have taken risks on a significant amount of lines without strong sales history and got their fingers burnt.  Poor buying? Unless we can find out the results of their main competitors for the same period we can\u2019t tell if online musical instruments retail has become a low profit game or if G4M are just not particularly good at it.",

AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt.

I had spent yesterday's money but actually I decided to take the small but improtant profit here and have put into *RUA* (instead of AVCT as I dont want to pay more than I sold for; I know, it's a problem..) which is due news. Then I will bring it back here with perhaps a little going to AVCT when time passed will mean it no longer matters. G4M seems to be a very safe haven now.",

I've already 'covered' a portion of the cost of the guitar here :-) Before your comments I sold all my scancell (only a few \u00a3100s) at a profit and could now nearly buy them back again despite the fees. The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",

A \u00a320m market cap with depreciation adjusted profit before tax of \u00a37-10m and a bit of debt which could be paid off by normalising inventory (\u00a334m at year end) back to pre covid levels (\u00a322m).

This turnover growth is not much more than inflationary and, once av.com and the second hand stuff are taken into account, probably shows no growth for the core online MI retail market.  The days of high growth rates are over.  (There is plenty to go at \u2013 market leader Thomann is likely turning over in excess of \u20ac1 billion \u2013 but G4M has no real competitive advantage to make inroads.  Online MI retail seems to have reached maturity.) That being the case G4M needs to make money out of the business its already doing.  It seems to be making progress but isn\u2019t talking about being ahead of the very modest profit levels in the forecast. The statement says that they have been \u201cdriving significant cost efficiencies in out software development unit\u201d.  Their comparatively high spend on this has always been promoted as a competitive advantage for G4M.  Reducing it suggests that the real beneficial work on software development has been done and its benefits are already largely in the figures and forecasts.

They\u2019ve got a large in-house development team, 50+ people compared to some other listed retailers who have a handful or less. They also have a growing stable of in-house organic and acquired brands which give them 42% gross margin. OK, they need to improve on 5% EBITDA off \u00a3150m sales, but at a sub \u00a320m valuation, this is well in the buying zone for me. They have absolutely masses of customer data: 1.65m email subscribers and info on over 4m individual customers in the last 6 years is hugely valuable. They should be excellently positioned to benefit from the whole AI toolkit to generate sales over the coming years. I raised my eyebrows at the cost of av.com but that aside their combined strategy of bringing in well known brands, developing a secondhand offering and then extending that sales, procurement, logistics and online marketing expertise into new markets outside of instruments into AV and then hopefully other markets with similar attributes such as sporting goods, camping gear or pretty much whatever you like is a long term winner for me.",

To date only the UK and German website are up and running so too early to say how much its worth (although with Go Daddy currently advertising \u2018av.tech\u2019 and \u2018av.store\u2019 at \u00a35141 pa, \u00a33m does seem pricey).  They also paid \u00a32.516m goodwill for the av.com business. Revenue by product category is given on page 2 of the FY23 accounts.  AV.com will be in the \u2018Other\u2019 category of 4% of turnover (FY22 3%).  The FY22 accounts split this 'other' category into \u2018Home Audio & Visual\u2019 2% and \u2018other\u2019 1%.  From this a very rough calculation can be done.  My guess is that av.com was in the region of \u00a34.5m FY23, \u00a33m FY22.  For av.com FY22 was only included for the last 4 months so sales would appear to have fallen.  In the last full year under its previous ownership sales were in excess of \u00a38m, so I don\u2019t expect G4M to be highlighting it in their reports. With the av.com website offering nothing that their established online competitors don\u2019t also offer I would expect progress at av.com to be slow.",

Online shopping is so much less hassle than bricks and mortar shopping making it much easier to shop around.  So if they manage to suggest to you that the product you are buying (x) goes well with something else (y) all you need to do is open another tab and find who is selling product y the cheapest and buy it from them.  No need to buy x and y from the same retailer.  No need to walk a mile to see how much someone else is selling it for, its just a few clicks away. An online retailer doesn\u2019t get to talk to the customer face to face so they are very difficult to influence, very difficult to affect the sales lifetime value.  Almost everything is dominated by price (if you and your competitors are competent in customer delivery). They bought av.com as their \u2018platform supports multiple verticals\u2019.  They have said very little about it but Progressive Research think its off to a slow start.  Almost whatever area they more into they will be up against others with developed online retail platforms so will find it no easier that musical instrument retail. Bar cutting costs I don\u2019t know how they produce profit for shareholders.  This kind of online retail isn\u2019t as profitable as it was a few years ago when most of your competitors had physical shops to support.

So, unless one can get into a monopolistic position, we shouldn\u2019t really expect much profit.  But making nothing on \u00a3150m sales seems a particularly poor performance especially when there are no real exceptional items. They talk about having to increase stock early in the period due to shipping delays.  In an inflationary environment buying early should increase reported margin.  That they have said they have had to discount some to shift it suggests that they haven\u2019t just accelerated buying strong selling lines but have taken risks on a significant amount of lines without strong sales history and got their fingers burnt.  Poor buying? Unless we can find out the results of their main competitors for the same period we can\u2019t tell if online musical instruments retail has become a low profit game or if G4M are just not particularly good at it.",

There is no reason for G4M\u2019s market share to change much one way or the other.  Even the UK\u2019s main bricks and mortar retailer in the sector (PMT) has returned to its pre Covid sales level so there is no evidence of online retailers increasing their market share rapidly.  AV.com is a slow burn at best as there are other established online players in the sector.  They talk about own brand but at the cheap end there is loads of China factory direct stuff on Amazon, in the mid-market there are established worldwide brand names, the more specialist product requires top online and magazine reviews to sell (very difficult to get consistently with OEM and ODM product) and the high end is a hobbyists market that won\u2019t buy own brand.  So AV.com has no competitive advantage. Net debt, while manageable, Is too high to allow other ventures.  So it maybe a quiet couple of years from G4M while they pay down debt. No reason for the market to change its valuation.",

The RSI has fallen back a little but still >70. Good place to see if RSI will be kind to me and no problem if it isn't. I know it doesn't always work, after hemo. I have often made money on Future PLC despite it being in downtrend for quite a while. It's weird. It's always been lucky for me. Opposite effect with Xeros but still keeping fingers crossed.

The bottom Bollinger band may in the future stop going down and join the upper Bollinger band in going up, at which time there may be an equity retracement, to reflect the reduction in volatility. There is no overhead supply from previous trading volume in the last two years, so resistance from stale selling is minimal. DYOR.",

Joined LSE in Jan 2023 and has only ever posted on G4M, always in a negative manner. Clearly has an agenda. I spent a decent bit of time on Friday going over the last few years of financial statements. Things worth noting; - They own freehold property of ~\u00a37.8m, including a \u00a35m head office and some distribution centres. These are genuine assets and mean that in my mind the real net debt figure is sub \u00a37m. - Cash generated from operations totals \u00a347m over the last 5 years, including \u00a37.2m last year. Completely out of sync with the current \u00a325m market cap. Likely to generate ~\u00a310m this year. - The most stunning figure is the balance sheet equity of \u00a337m, I've never seen a going concern trading at 50% of it's book value. Pre Covid in March 2020 it's BV was \u00a321m, at the bottom of the Covid crash shares hit \u00a31.40, valuing the business at \u00a328m or 1.3x BV. An equivalent valuation today would have a market cap of \u00a349m / \u00a32.35 a share. So at \u00a31.30 it's still obscenely cheap IMO. It's worth noting that Marks Electrical, an online retailer of household appliances, with turnover of \u00a3113m, gross margins of ~20% and adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of \u00a37.5m, is trading at a \u00a3103m market cap. Their balance sheet equity totals \u00a313m... I know which one I'd rather own if I wanted to make a good return over the next 12 months as consumer confidence returns.",
