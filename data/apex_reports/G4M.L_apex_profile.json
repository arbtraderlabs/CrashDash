In FY24 H1 EBITDA adjusted for \u00a30.5m one-off redundancy costs (FY23 H1: \u00a3nil).\nFY24 H1 Highlights:\n-\nResults reflect delivery against previously stated prioritisation of improved gross margins and reduced costs over sales growth in a continuing challenging retail environment, particularly in our European markets:\no\nA 6% decline in revenue resulted from a planned focus on prioritising gross margins which improved by 80bps, with the Group benefiting from an improved stock profile and lower delivery costs in FY24 H1; and\no\nCost reduction initiatives to achieve \u00a34.0m of annualised cash savings were delivered in FY24 H1, with the benefit from FY24 H2 onwards - associated one-off exceptional cost of \u00a30.5m.\n-\nGood progress against the objective of reducing Group net debt to \u00a318.1m, \u00a33.7m lower than last year (30 September 2022: \u00a321.8m), representing a high-point in the annual cash cycle as the business starts to build stock ahead of the peak trading period.\n-\nSecond Hand system continues to show good potential following European launch during FY24 H1.\n-\nWell prepared ahead of the seasonal peak trading period, with a continuing focus on efficiency and margin improvements\n.\nTrading Outlook:\n\u00b7\nWhilst profit expectations remain the same, we are moderating our revenue expectation for the year to \u00a3144m, to reflect sales run rates and the actions taken to prioritise profits over growth. This has been offset by an increase in gross margins and lower costs contributing to higher overall profit margins. As such, full-year adjusted/underlying profit outlook remains in-line with current consensus market expectations**.\n\u00b7\nNet debt and on-hand inventory expected to be further reduced by 31 March 2024.\nCommenting on the results, Andrew Wass, Chief Executive Officer said:\n\"We are pleased to have made good progress during the period against our strategic objectives of increasing gross margins, reducing our cost base, and further enhancing our customer proposition with the launch of our Second-Hand system in Europe.\nAlthough consumer demand has remained subdued this year due to the weaker environment, our FY24 H1 revenues were 27% higher than our pre-Covid FY20 H1 revenues, and we remain confident in our long-term growth strategy.\nThe decisive actions we have taken will ensure the business can return to stronger profitable growth by the next financial year, as we leverage efficiencies driven by AI, build upon our platform for growth, and diversify our channels to market.\nWe are well prepared for our seasonal peak trading period with a range of recently developed great value music products, and we look forward to providing a further trading update after Christmas on the 18 January 2024.\"\n** Gear4music believes that current consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2024 prior to the publication of this announcement are revenues of \u00a3\n161.7 million, adjusted EBITDA of \u00a39.8 million and adjusted profit before tax of \u00a31.2 million\n.\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel/Sam Butcher, Corporate Finance\nTom Salvesen, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nDavid Ison\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.co.uk\nAbout Gear4music\n.com\nOperating from a Head Office in York, Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany, the Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals, in the UK, Europe and the Rest of the World.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platform, with multilingual, multicurrency websites delivering to over 190 countries, the Group continues to build its overseas presence.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nBusiness Review\nThe business reports the Group's results for the six months to 30 September 2023, and updates on the strategic and commercial progress made in the Period.\nStrategy\nThe business was in an improved position heading into FY24 having achieved material reductions in stock and net debt in FY23 H2, albeit at a lower gross margin than would normally be the case. Our focus in FY24 H1 pivoted to improving gross margin and cutting costs to provide the platform to restore profitability back towards the levels reached in previous periods, whilst maintaining a disciplined approach to working capital management.\nConsumer confidence remains low across the UK and many European markets which in some cases has created a highly price competitive situation for certain products. As the largest UK-based retailer in our sector, our focus is maintaining a disciplined approach to product pricing, whilst reconfiguring the business to ensure the Group is profitable irrespective of market conditions.\nIn June 2023 we renewed our banking facilities, entering into a committed three-year \u00a330m 'Revolving Credit Facility' ('RCF') with HSBC, providing a good level of headroom to meet our requirements. Nevertheless, the Board remains focused on prioritising a reduction in net debt, which we are doing focusing on cash generation, reducing our investment in software development, and actively managing stock levels across our distribution centres to reflect the evolving demand.\nWe continue to make progress against the three pillars of our progressive e-commerce strategy, and outline developments in each area below:\nE-commerce Excellence\nFY24 H1\nFY23 H1\nChange on FY23 H1\nRevenue\n\u00a362.6m\n\u00a366.3m\n(6%)\nTotal unique website users\n9.8m\n9.1m\n+7%\nMobile site unique users\n6.6m\n6.6m\n-\nConversion rate\n3.97%\n4.90%\n(93bps)\nAverage order value\n\u00a3161\n\u00a3151\n+7%\nActive customers *\n823,000\n903,000\n(9%)\nProportion of repeat customers **\n26.3%\n26.5%\n-20bps\nEmail subscriber database\n1,720,200\n1,408,200\n+22%\nTrustpilot rating\n4.7/5\n4.7/5\n-\n* Active customers are those that have purchased products within the last 12 months\n** Repeat customers are those that have made a purchase in the defined period and have historically made at least one purchase\nUK revenue in the Period was 3% ahead of last year, effectively reversing a 3% decrease last year on FY22 H1. The UK market in FY24 H1 was more resilient than other territories, reflecting Gear4music's brand recognition and scale in our core market.\nInternational revenue in the Period was 15% behind FY23 H1 reversing a 10% increase last year, as certain markets became highly price competitive at times, and Gear4music held its pricing levels in-line with strategy.\n'Cost-per-Click' ('CPC') continues to be high relative to where it has historically been, with competition for less traffic in the current economic climate. We are successfully using automated AI models to maximise revenue at any defined level of return on investment, and we purposefully held marketing costs as a proportion of revenue flat on last year and FY22 H1 at 6.9%. As a consequence, the proportion of visitors from organic and direct sources increased to 51% from 46% in FY23 H1, and 38% in FY22 H1.\nWebsite user numbers increased 7% to 9.8m reflecting an increase in browsing and visits from lower-intent to purchase prospective customers coming from direct and organic sources. Visitors to our UK sites increased by 24% offsetting a 5% reduction in visitor numbers to the Group's international websites. This shift, alongside Gear4music keeping certain prices higher than the overall market during periods of heightened competition, contributed to a reduction in conversion rate from 4.9% in FY23 H1 to 4.0%. UK conversion fell from 5.8% to 4.4% whilst European conversion reduced from 4.2% to 3.6%. Mobile conversion also fell from 2.8% to 2.4%.\nMobile continues to be a major theme with 68% of users coming through this channel (FY23 H1: 72%; FY22 H1: 65%).\n'Average Order Value' ('AOV') increased by 7% to \u00a3161 further to a 19% increase last year reflecting a return to normalised pricing, and inflationary price increases, meaning the business processes fewer orders to achieve an equivalent level of sales.\nThe Group served 341,000 customers in the Period (-11% on FY23 H1) and 'Active customers', being those that have purchased products within the last 12 months, similarly decreased by 9%.\nThe proportion of repeat customers remained broadly flat at 26.3% (FY23 H1: 26.5%), having increased from 24.4% in FY22 H1, reflecting a proportionally lower level of paid-for new customers. The level of repeat custom is lower than in other e-commerce sectors, reflecting the nature of the Group's product range and high average order value, and re-affirms the importance of the Group being profitable from the first customer transaction.\nThe number of subscribers on our email database increased by 0.3 million to 1.7 million and we continue to make improvements to our email retargeting with the objective of cost-efficiency increasing the number of repeat customers.\nWe continue to invest in our customer proposition and service teams, resulting in a great overall customer experience, reflected in Gear4music.com's Trustpilot score of 4.7/5 and 'Excellent' rating from over 125,000 reviews.\nThe Group invested \u00a32.4m in its e-commerce platform in the Period (FY23 H1: \u00a32.8m) with deployments including:\n\u00b7\nEuropean launch of second-hand\n\u00b7\nEuropean third-party fulfilment\n\u00b7\nEnhanced website product configurator\nSupply Chain Evolution\nFY24 H1\nFY23 H1\nChange on FY23 H1\nOwn-brand product sales\n\u00a315.2m\n\u00a315.0m\n+2%\nOther brand product sales\n\u00a344.7m\n\u00a348.3m\n(8%)\nProduct margin\n30.9%\n30.9%\n-\nProducts listed\n63,900\n62,500\n+2%\nBrands listed\n1,134\n1,109\n+2%\nFY24 H1 gross margin of 27.1% is an 80bps improvement on FY23 H1, with the improvement coming from relatively lower costs on shipping products to our customers linked to a high proportion of UK-sales and a higher AOV.\nAchieving strong gross margins is critical to the overall profitability of the Group and as such is a key business objective. In H2 last year, a period when traditionally margins would be expected to have improved on H1, product margin became a secondary priority as we focused on reducing stock and net debt, and product margins decreased from 30.9% down to 29.4%. As such it was important in FY24 H1 we improved product margins back to historical levels, irrespective of the tough consumer environment.\nA flat product margin of 30.9% reflects a 20bps improvement in own-brand margin to 44.1%, a 50bps fall in other-branded margin, and a positive sales mix effect as own-brand accounted for 25.4% of product sales compared to 23.6% in FY23 H1.\nThe number of 'Stock-Keeping-Units' ('SKUs') listed increased from 62,500 at 30 September 2022 to 64,200 at 31 March 2023 and decreased to 63,900 at 30 September 2023 as we removed less profitable, slow-moving SKUs, representing a net 2% increase in 12 months (1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022: +3%).\nStock at 30 September 2023 of \u00a339.0m is \u00a34.4m (10%) lower than at 30 September 2022 reflecting a continued focus on reducing both stock levels in light of lower customer demand, and net debt.\nOwn-brand\nIt has been an exciting period for own-brand product development with a number of new product lines coming to fruition, alongside establishing our new brand architecture with a fresh approach to branding and customer experience. We have made significant improvements to elevate brand identity and perception with a strong emphasis on the customer journey through improved brand assets including lifestyle imagery and video content, and updating existing product lines such as specifications, price points, packaging and supporting documents.\nThe number of our own-brand products increased from 4,250 at 30 September 2022 to 5,200 (+22%) at 30 September 2023, with own-brand revenue accounting for 25.4% of total product sales from just 8.1% of SKUs, reflecting the significant on-going efforts of our in-house team in developing our range of high-quality instruments and equipment at affordable prices.\nInternational Expansion\nOur international customer proposition continues to be improved from our existing footprint, with improving stock profiles better reflecting local and adjacent territory demand, and increasing the number of cost effective and premium delivery options.\nThe Group estimates it has a European distribution infrastructure capable of handling \u00a3150m of revenue per annum, and is well placed to capitalise on the medium-term growth opportunity as and when consumer markets improve.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nContinuing macro-economic uncertainties have impacted the consumer in the UK and across Europe. Whilst profit expectations remain the same, we are moderating our revenue expectation for the year to \u00a3144m, to reflect sales run rates and the actions taken to prioritise profits over growth. The impact on the bottom line has been offset by an increase in gross margins and lower costs.\nWe are well-prepared ahead of the seasonal peak trading period and our full-year adjusted/underlying profit outlook remains in-line with current consensus market expectations.\nWe remain confident in the enduring consumer demand for Gear4Music products, and we are well-placed to benefit once the consumer discretionary spend environment improves.\nThe Group plans to issue a Christmas trading update on 18 January 2024.\nFinancial Review\nFY24 H1\nFY23 H1\nChange on FY23 H1\nRevenue\n\u00a362.6m\n\u00a366.3m\n(6%)\nGross profit\n\u00a317.0m\n\u00a317.4m\n(2%)\nGross margin\n27.1%\n26.3%\n+80bps\nUnadjusted EBITDA\n\u00a32.4m\n\u00a32.7m\n(12%)\nExceptional item - Redundancy costs\n(\u00a30.5m)\n-\n(\u00a30.5m)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\u00a32.9m\n\u00a32.7m\n+6%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n4.6%\n4.1%\n+50bps\nOperating loss\n(\u00a30.9m)\n(\u00a30.3m)\n(\u00a30.6m)\nMarketing costs\n\u00a34.3m\n\u00a34.6m\n(6%)\nMarketing costs as % of revenue\n6.9%\n6.9%\n-\nTotal Labour costs\n\u00a36.9m\n\u00a37.0m\n(1%)\nTotal Labour costs as % of revenue\n11.0%\n10.5%\n(50bps)\nCash and cash equivalents\n\u00a35.9m\n\u00a37.2m\n(\u00a31.3m)\nNet bank debt\n\u00a318.1m\n\u00a321.8m\n(\u00a33.7m)\nRevenue\nRevenue in the Period of \u00a362.6m was \u00a33.7m (6%) lower than last year. UK revenue was up 3% taking our estimated share of a flat UK market to 9.3% (FY23 H1: 9.1%). International revenues of \u00a326.1m were 15% down on last year reflecting difficult trading conditions, and accounted for 42% of Group revenue compared to 47% in FY23 H1.\nGross Margin and Gross Profit\nAs outlined above in the 'Business Review' gross margin improved 80bps from 26.3% last year to 27.1%, reflecting a product margin that was flat on FY23 H1 but importantly 150bps higher than FY23 H2, and a relative reduction in delivery costs reflecting a 7% higher AOV, and a greater proportion of UK-sales where delivery costs are typically lower.\nNet result of revenue and gross margin movements is gross profit of \u00a317.0m, being \u00a30.4m (2%) lower than last year.\nExceptional items\nExceptional costs of \u00a30.5m relate to redundancy costs incurred during the restructure of various Head Office teams, principally Software Development. These costs were paid in full in FY24 H1.\nOperating Loss and Administrative Expenses\nThe operating loss before exceptional items of \u00a30.4m represents a \u00a30.1m decrease on FY23 H1 reflecting a fall of \u00a30.4m in gross profit mitigated by a net \u00a30.3m reduction in admin expenses.\nAdmin expenses increased from 27.4% of sales in FY23 H1 to 28.5% in FY24 H1.\nMarketing and labour costs continue to be key components of our cost base, accounting for a combined 63% of total administrative expenses in the Period (FY23 H1: 65%):\n-\nOur marketing spend continues to be heavily invested in direct 'Pay-per-click' ('PPC') marketing and our approach focuses on delivering a pre-defined return on investment. Marketing costs of \u00a34.3m equated to 6.9% of sales, the same as in FY23 H1 and FY22 H1. Alongside this it is important we invest in enhancing our organic and direct marketing capabilities which in the longer term will support our ambition to reduce marketing spend as a proportion of sales.\n-\nTotal labour costs decreased 1% on FY23 H1 with an estimated 8% increase in average salary offset by a reduction in average headcount of 72. Headcount at 30 September 2023 (including Software Development team) of 434 was 20% lower than as at 30 September 2022 (541).\nEuropean distribution centre local admin expenses increased \u00a30.1m (4%) on FY23 H1, to \u00a32.5m reflecting inflationary cost increases limited by reduced activity.\nDepreciation and amortisation in the Period totalled \u00a33.3m (FY23 H1: \u00a33.0m) including amortisation of \u00a31.8m (FY23 H1: \u00a31.4m) relating to our bespoke e-commerce platform, and \u00a30.9m depreciation of 'Right of Use' assets (FY23 H1: \u00a30.8m).\nAn adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.6% compares to 4.1% last year and 7.4% in FY22 H1.\nNet Loss and Financial Expenses\nFinancial expenses of \u00a31.0m include \u00a30.8m bank interest (FY23 H1: \u00a30.5m) reflecting increased interest rates and the level of debt in the business, and \u00a30.2m interest on lease liabilities (FY23 H1: \u00a30.2m).\nA tax credit of \u00a30.4m restricted the loss in the Period to \u00a31.6m, compared to a \u00a31.1m net loss in FY23 H1.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nIn FY23 the business successfully reduced its stockholding to better reflect the level of sales and as such FY24 has seen a return to a more usual trading pattern, with a stock increase of \u00a34.6m since 31 March 2023 ahead of the peak Christmas trading period. Stock at 30 September 2023 includes \u00a34.4m of inbound stock-in-transit (30 September 2022: \u00a34.1m) that will arrive ahead of peak trading.\nTrade and other payables of \u00a320.3m were \u00a31.4m (7%) higher than last year reflecting stock deals on pre-agreed terms, and includes \u00a31.4m of customer prepayments (30 September 2022: \u00a32.2m).\nNet bank debt was \u00a318.1m at what is historically a low point in the annual cash cycle, leaving headroom of \u00a311.9m within the Group's \u00a330m RCF, and is expected to reduce further by 31 March 2024.\nCapitalised software development costs totalled \u00a32.4m in the Period (FY23 H1: \u00a32.8m), taking total capitalisation to date to \u00a327.4m. Amortisation in the Period was \u00a31.8m leading to a \u00a30.6m increase in net book value since the start of the financial year to \u00a313.4m. In FY23 we capitalised \u00a35.3m of software development costs. The post-restructure annualised capitalisation run rate based on the current team, is \u00a32.8m compared to amortisation of \u00a33.1m in FY23.\nProperty, plant and equipment capital expenditure was limited to \u00a336,000 in the Period (FY23 H1: \u00a30.6m).\nDividend Policy\nThe Board does not recommend the payment of a dividend (FY23 H1: nil). Consistent with its previous stated approach, the Group will revisit its shareholder distribution policy at the appropriate time.\nUnaudited consolidated interim statement of profit and loss and other

(Holdings) plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom, and is listed on the Alternative Investment Market ('AIM') of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe Group financial information consolidates the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Group\"). The Group has 100% owned trading subsidiaries in the UK ('Gear4music Limited'), Sweden ('Gear4music Sweden AB'), Germany ('Gear4music GmbH'), Ireland ('Gear4music Ireland Limited') and Spain ('Gear4music Spain S.L.'). The Group also has two 100% owned dormant subsidiaries in the UK ('Cagney Limited' and 'AV Distribution Limited') and one in Norway ('Gear4music Norway').\nThe principal activity of the Group is the retail of musical instruments and equipment.\nThe registered office of Gear4music (Holdings) plc (company number: 07786708) and Gear4music Limited (company number: 03113256) is Holgate Park Drive, York, YO26 4GN.\n1\nAccounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated interim financial information, which has been neither audited nor reviewed by the auditor, has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for land and buildings that are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The condensed consolidated interim financial information does not constitute financial statements within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 and does not include all of the information and disclosures required for full annual financial statements and is thus not in full compliance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. It should therefore be read in conjunction with the Group's Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2023, which has been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Financial Reporting Standards and is available on the Group's investor website.\nThe accounting policies used in the financial information are consistent with those used in the Group's consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2023, as detailed on pages 69 to 74 of the Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2023, a copy of which is available on the Group's website, www.gear4musicplc.com.\nAs permitted, this interim report has been prepared in accordance with the AIM rules and not in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim financial reporting\".\nThe comparative financial information contained in the condensed consolidated financial information in respect of the year ended 31 March 2023 has been extracted from the 2023 Financial Statements. Those financial statements have been reported on by Grant Thornton UK LLP, and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report was unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nSelected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Group since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at the year ended 31 March 2023.\nExceptional items\nThe business classifies certain events as exceptional items due to their size and nature where it feels that separate disclosure would help understand the underlying performance of the business. Restructuring and transformational costs are considered on a case-by-case basis as to whether they meet the exceptional criteria. Other items are considered against the exceptional criteria based on the specific circumstances. The presentation is consistent with the way Financial Performance is measured by management and reported to the Board. Further information is disclosed in note 5.\nNotes to the Interim Financial Information (continued)\nGoing concern\nThe Group's business activities and position in the market, and principal risks, uncertainties and mitigations are described in detail in the Strategic Report included on pages 1 to 45 of the Group's 2023 Annual Report and Financial Statements.\nOn 15 June 2023 the Group renewed its RCF with HSBC at \u00a330m for a further three-year period. This facility provides a good and appropriate level of headroom that has been factored into the Directors going concern assessment.\nThe Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient facilities to cover its future funding requirements.\nAt 30 September 2023 the Group had net debt of \u00a318.1m (30 September 2022: \u00a321.8m) including \u00a35.9m cash (30 September 2023: \u00a37.2m), with a good and appropriate level of headroom that has been factored into the Directors going concern assessment.\nThe Directors have considered the Group's prospects based on its current proposition and online offering in\nthe UK and Europe, strategic developments delivered and in progress, and concluded that there are significant opportunities for profitable growth as channel shift continues and customers move online.\nThere is a diverse supply chain with no key dependencies.\nHaving duly considered all of these factors and having reviewed the forecasts for the period to 31 December 2024, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future, and as such continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\n2 Principal risks and uncertainties\nThe Board considers the principal risks and uncertainties which could impact the Group over the remaining six months of the financial year to 31 March 2024 to be unchanged from those set out in the group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2023, and can be summarised as:\n-\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical factors\n-\nClimate risk and sustainability\n-\nUK outside the EU\n-\nChange management - Operational, Regulatory and Technological\n-\nIT and Cyber Security\n-\nManagement of Warehousing and Distribution\n-\nGlobal pandemics\n-\nBrand and proposition\n-\nCompetition\n-\nSupplier relationships\n-\nFinancial risk\n-\nESG\nThese are set out in detail on pages 36 to 42 of the Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2023, a copy of which is available on the Group's Plc website, www.gear4musicplc.com.\nNotes to the Interim Financial Information (continued)\n3\nSegmental analysis\nRevenue by Geography:\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2023\n6 months ended 30 September 2022\nYear ended31 March 2023\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nUK\n36,535\n35,459\n82,084\nEurope and Rest of the World\n26,106\n30,846\n69,955\n62,641\n66,305\n152,039\nAdministrative Expenses by Geography:\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2023\n6 months ended 30 September 2022\nYear ended31 March 2023\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nUK\n15,330\n15,718\n33,678\nEurope and Rest of the World\n2,507\n2,420\n5,027\nExceptional items - UK\n487\n-\n-\n18,324\n18,138\n38,705\nRevenue by Category:\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2023\n6 months ended 30 September 2022\nYear ended31 March 2023\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nOther-brand products\n44,682\n48,329\n106,189\nOwn-brand products\n15,219\n14,966\n38,860\nCarriage income\n2,484\n2,672\n6,187\nWarranty income\n184\n220\n452\nOther\n72\n118\n351\n62,641\n66,305\n152,039\nNotes to the Interim Financial Information (continued)\n4\nExpenses and other income\nIncluded in profit/loss are the following:\n6 months ended 30 September\n2023\n6 months ended 30 September 2022\nYear ended31 March 2023\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n634\n716\n1,414\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets\n863\n797\n1,577\nAmortisation of intangible assets\n1,815\n1,457\n3,090\nAmortisation of government grants\n-\n3\n3\n(Profit)/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n(6)\n17\n17\nR&D expenditure recognised as an expense\n117\n141\n280\nOther income\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2023\n6 months ended 30 September 2022\nYear ended31 March 2023\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRDEC tax credits\n145\n231\n445\nRental income\n99\n96\n239\nOther\n163\n132\n265\nTotal other income\n407\n459\n949\nRental income relates to our freehold Head Office in York.

Options in the plans are settled in equity in the Company and are subject to vesting conditions. Relevant events in the Period include:\nOptions granted - CSOP (2023)\nOn 9 May 2023 options over a total of 56,023 Ordinary shares were granted to 22 non-Director employees under the Company's CSOP scheme.\nLTIP (2023) replacing LTIP (2021) and LTIP (2018)\nOn 21 July 2023 the Group adopted a replacement long term incentive plan ('LTIP') with share awards made to key members of the management team. The Group's Remuneration Committee made these awards so that the key people to lead the business into the future are appropriately incentivised in a manner that aligns with the interests of the Group's shareholders. The new LTIP replaced the two existing LTIPs established in 2018 (and subsequently re-based in 2020) and in 2021 in full, with all awards made under those LTIPs replaced and cancelled.\nUnder the new LTIP, Gear4music Limited, ('G4M Ltd'), a wholly owned subsidiary of Gear4music (Holdings) plc issued 1,038,000 'E' ordinary shares of one-pence each ('E-Shares'), which are non-voting, non-dividend, restricted shares to the relevant individuals. The initial subscription cost was paid by the relevant individual with the proceeds received from the redemption by G4M Ltd of the 'C' ordinary shares of one-pence each and 'D' ordinary shares of ten pence each from the 2018 and 2021 LTIPs respectively at their nominal value. Any excess owed to the relevant individual was paid in cash; any excess owed by the relevant individual for the subscription cost of E Shares was paid by way of a small cash bonus.\nThese E Shares vest subject to achieving certain share price targets between 2026 and 2030, at which point the E Shares can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis for new ordinary shares in Gear4music (Holdings) plc. The weighted average vesting period over the life of the new LTIP is five years from the date of grant.\nFurther details of the new LTIP are as follows:\nFinancial year ending 31 March Vesting date Share price target No. E Shares vesting\n2026 27 July 2026 \u00a33 207,600\n2027 26 July 2027 \u00a35 207,600\n2028 24 July 2028 \u00a37 207,600\n2029 30 July 2029 \u00a310 207,600\n2030 29 July 2030 \u00a313 207,600\nTotal 1,038,000\nThe Group's executive directors participate in the new LTIP as detailed below:\nIndividual Title / role No. E Shares awarded\nAndrew Wass Chief Executive Officer 250,000\nChris Scott Chief Financial Officer 250,000\nGareth Bevan Chief Commercial Officer 250,000\nTotal 750,000\n18 Related party transactions\nThere were no significant related party transactions during the six months to 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: none).\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
