Total revenue for the three months to 31 December 2025 increased by 32% to \u00a364.6m (FY25 Q3: \u00a349.0m), reflecting strong momentum across all geographies. This broad-based growth demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy and the continued appeal of our proposition to customers.\nUK revenue increased 27% to \u00a337.8m, with our York warehouse running close to maximum capacity. As previously announced, plans are in place to expand UK-capacity in FY27 in line with our long-term strategy.\nEuropean and Rest of the World revenue increased 39% to \u00a326.8m, underlining the strength and scalability of our international platform.\nGross margin improved to 29.0% (FY25 Q3: 28.1%), reflecting ongoing pricing discipline and operational execution in improved market conditions. As a result, gross profit increased by \u00a35.0m to \u00a318.7m compared with the prior year period. The Board is encouraged by the quality of this cash-generative growth, which has translated into profitability ahead of consensus market expectations for the full financial year.\nAlongside this strong trading performance, we have continued to make progress against our long-term infrastructure plans. The Group has signed a 15-year lease for a new UK warehouse in Sherburn in Elmet near York, providing the additional capacity and efficiency required to support future UK growth. Following further review, the expected capital expenditure for the new UK automated warehouse has been re-phased, with \u00a310.2m now anticipated in FY27 and \u00a38.5m** in FY28. This re-phasing derisks project delivery and reduces the near-term financial impact and lowers anticipated borrowing requirements.\nWhile the macro-economic and consumer environment remains uncertain, the Group continues to deliver strong momentum and improving profitability, supported by a clear and disciplined strategy for sustainable growth.\nGiven the continued strength of trading and the benefits of the revised capital expenditure profile, the Board has upgraded its expectations for FY26, FY27 and FY28.\nThe Board would like to thank all our colleagues across the business for their continued commitment and hard work, which have been instrumental in delivering this performance.\n\"\n*Gear4music believes that prior to the release of this update, consensus market expectations for the year ending 31 March 2026 are revenues of \u00a3182.5 million, EBITDA of \u00a316.7 million and profit before tax of \u00a38.3 million, and for the year ending 31 March 2027 are revenue of \u00a3188.0 million, EBITDA of \u00a314.4 million and profit before tax of \u00a34.1 million.\n**Phase 2 \u00a38.5m estimated capital expenditure is subject to final supplier negotiation and steel price variation.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive C\nhair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel\nAnastassiya Eley\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma Strategic Communications - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nSarah Peters\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.com\nAbout Gear4music\n(Holdings) plc\nGear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and music equipment in the UK, delivering to 190 countries across Europe and the Rest of the World.\nThe Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals.\nOperating from a Head Office in York, the Group has Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platform, with multilingual, multicurrency websites, the Group continues to build its overseas presence.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\").

Complementing our existing York facilities, the new site will increase our UK distribution capacity by approximately 2.5 times and provide the operational efficiency needed to support the next phase of our expansion and our long-term growth ambitions.\nThe strength of year-to-date trading gives the Board further confidence to again raise its expectations for the Group's financial performance for the year ending 31 March 2026, following the upgrades announced in June 2025, September 2025 and October 2025, and we now expect EBITDA to be not less than \u00a315.0m.\nWe look forward to providing a further trading update after the Christmas period on 20 January 2026.\"\n* Gear4music believes that current consensus market expectations prior to the release of this update for the year ending 31 March 2026 were revenues of \u00a3\n169.4 million, EBITDA of \u00a313.7 million and profit before tax of \u00a35.5 million\n.\nEnquiries:\nGear4music\nAndrew Wass, Executive Chair\nGareth Bevan, Chief Executive Officer\nChris Scott, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nSinger Capital Markets - Nominated Adviser and Broker\nPeter Steel/Sam Butcher, Corporate Finance\nTom Salvesen, Corporate Broking\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nAlma Strategic Communications - Financial PR\nRebecca Sanders-Hewett\nJoe Pederzolli\nSarah Peters\n+44 (0)20 3405 0205\nGear4music@almastrategic.co.uk\nAbout Gear4music\n(Holdings) plc\nGear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and music equipment in the UK, delivering to 190 countries across Europe and the Rest of the World.\nThe Group sells own-brand musical instruments and music equipment alongside premium third-party brands including Fender, Yamaha and Roland, to customers ranging from beginners to musical enthusiasts and professionals.\nOperating from a Head Office in York, the Group has Distribution Centres in York, Bacup, Sweden, Germany, Ireland & Spain, and showrooms in York, Bacup, Sweden & Germany.\nHaving developed its own e-commerce platform, with multilingual, multicurrency websites, the Group continues to build its overseas presence.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nBusiness Review\nThe Group reports its results for the six months to 30 September 2025, and updates on the Strategic, Commercial and Financial progress made in the Period.\nGrowth Strategy\nHaving laid the foundations for our revised Growth Strategy announced in June 2024 through strategic investments in people, processes, and structures during FY24, we refocused on driving profitable revenue growth in FY25. In FY26, we have made tangible progress across multiple Growth Strategy initiatives, resulting in a step-up in revenue growth to 31% in the Period in addition to a significant increase in margins and profitability:\n-\nAsset acquisitions\nDuring the Period, the insolvencies of Guitar, Amp & Keyboard ('GAK') in April 2025 and PMT Play Music Today ('PMT') in June 2025 created a UK market opportunity estimated at up to \u00a363 million, based on their most recently filed accounts, and with our strength of brand and customer proposition we are well placed to take further market share. These developments also contributed to a more stable competitive environment, which had previously experienced periods of unusually aggressive pricing on certain branded products.\nAs announced we acquired the inventory of these two businesses and report related revenue of \u00a31.9m and gross profit of \u00a31.1m in the Period. At 30 September 2025 we had inventory with a carrying value of \u00a31.4m remaining.\n-\nMarketing\nIn FY25 H1, as previously announced, we encountered challenges with the implementation of an outsourced AI-based marketing system, which resulted in inefficient marketing and over-spend, and adversely impacted own-brand and European sales. In FY25 H2 we resolved these issues and recruited a new experienced Marketing Director with a background in e-commerce to build and lead a new team. Marketing performance in FY26 H1 has been transformed with costs as a percentage of sales improving from 7.3% in FY25 H1 to 6.4% in FY26 H1.\nWe brought Pay-per-Click ('PPC') management back in house and have now integrated with three European marketplaces, further developed our affiliate programs, and leveraged influencers to expand our reach.\nWe are in the process of moving to a new Customer Relationship Management ('CRM') platform that will provide a single customer view and higher quality, more reliable insights.\n-\nProduct offer - improved breadth and Own-brand progress\nThrough the Period we invested in inventory to add breadth to support sales growth, use our scale to access buying opportunities as and when they arise, and towards the end of the Period we pulled forward intake to reduce inbound warehouse pressures during peak and enable a focus on fulfilling orders. On-hand 'Stock-Keeping-Units' ('SKU's) increased from 24,700 last year to 29,200 this year.\nWe continue to invest in our Own-brand team with headcount increasing from 25 to 27 since the start of the financial year to support product development, efficient purchasing and inventory management across our distribution centres, to increase own-brand revenue into the medium term. In the Period we increased own-brand SKU count to 5,710 accounting for 22.2% of total product sales from 8.7% of total SKUs.\nProduct highlights include launches of several new ranges under our AVCOM, Studiospares, Gear4music Life, Premier, Hartwood, Eden and Vision brands.\n-\nNew UK Distribution Centre\nThe Group is close to agreeing a 15-year lease for a new, 132,000 square foot, distribution centre in Yorkshire, located close to its existing operations. The new distribution centre is scheduled to be operational in Autumn 2026 and will support the Group's strategic expansion and free up space in the current York site to enhance Showrooms, Second-hand sales, and Returns operations, and to consolidate operations from our Bacup site.\nThe Group will invest an estimated \u00a313m-15m into automation and fitting out through FY27 with a 3-5 year payback period, increasing and enhancing the Group's operational capacity to support continued growth which once established, is expected to deliver increasing operational efficiencies as the business expands.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nWhilst macro-economic uncertainties continue to weigh on consumers in the UK and across Europe, we see a continuation of the trends that have supported this period of very strong revenue growth. We remain confident in the enduring consumer demand for Gear4music products, and we are well-placed to further benefit once the consumer discretionary spend environment improves.\nWe are well-prepared ahead of the seasonal peak trading period and are taking pro-active action to manage the capacity limitations we anticipate at our York distribution centre. As a result of these factors, we are again in a position to upgrade our expectations with current year EBITDA now expected to be not less than \u00a315.0m.\nThe Group plans to issue a Christmas trading update on 20 January 2026.\nCommercial Review\nFY26 H1\nFY25 H1\nChange on FY25 H1\nRevenue\n\u00a380.7m\n\u00a361.7m\n+31%\nTotal sessions\n34.8m\n28.4m\n+23%\nMobile sessions\n16.6m\n14.4m\n+15%\nConversion rate - Sessions\n1.12%\n1.05%\n+7bps\nAverage order value\n\u00a3163\n\u00a3153\n+7%\nActive customers *\n928,000\n805,000\n+15%\nProportion of repeat customers **\n25.5%\n26.6%\n-110bps\nEmail subscriber database\n2.13m\n1.92m\n+11%\nTrustpilot rating\n4.6/5\n4.7/5\n-\n* Active customers are those that have purchased products within the last 12 months\n** Repeat customers are those that have made a purchase in the Period and have historically made at least one purchase\nUK revenue in the Period was 28% ahead of last year (FY25 H1: +6%), reflecting a more favourable competitive landscape following the insolvencies of GAK in April 2025 and PMT in June 2025, and the strength of our brand and proposition allowing us to take market share. We estimate our share of the UK market for new musical instruments and equipment to have increased to 11.4% from 9.7% in FY25 H1.\nInternational revenues returned to very strong growth being 35% ahead of last year (FY24 H1: down 12%), reflecting improved market conditions and a normalised level of efficient marketing as we move on from the problems we had with an outsourced AI-based marketing system.\nWe have responded to Google Analytics reporting challenges (due to opt-out of cookie consent leading to a higher proportion of modelled data) by refocusing on trends in session rather than user data. We are in the process of moving to a new customer data platform that will provide a single customer view and higher quality, more reliable insights:\n-\nWebsite sessions increased 23% from 28.4m to 34.8m, comprising a 21% increase in UK traffic and 25% in international traffic, reflecting heightened demand for our proposition in the current market. Mobile sessions increased by 15% to 16.6m, representing 48% of total sessions (FY25 H1: 51%).\n-\nConversion rates by session improved from 1.05% last year to 1.12% this year, with similar improvements in the UK from 1.05% to 1.13% and in Europe from 1.06% to 1.13%. Mobile conversion increased from 1.21% to 1.45%.\nAs artificial intelligence continues to reshape consumer behaviour and the search landscape, investing in brand visibility within search engine AI overviews and large language models ('LLM's) is increasingly important. Despite the industry-wide rise in 'zero-click' searches driven by AI-generated results, Gear4music's organic traffic share in the Period increased from 26% last year to 28% of total sessions. However, the growing influence of AI discovery, combined with reduced cookie consent rates, contributed to a decline in tracked direct sessions, which fell from 23% to 15% of overall traffic.\nOur own-brand influencer marketing initiative has been significantly upscaled in FY26 and is delivering strong results. Our approach includes a focus on Europe, with the aim of producing more localised and engaging content for our European audience. Key performance highlights for FY26 H1 include:\n-\nContent Published:\n710pcs\n(+315% YoY)\n-\nTotal Views:\n24.6m\n(+510% YoY)\n-\nTotal Engagements:\n1.68m\n(+624% YoY)\n-\nEngagement %:\n6.8%\n(+110bps YoY)\n'Average Order Value' ('AOV') increased 7% to \u00a3163 reversing a 5% decrease last year, and reflecting proportionally more high value branded sales and less pricing pressures on some SKUs in certain territories as compared to last year.\nThe Group served 433,000 customers in the Period (+24% on FY25 H1) and 'Active customers', being those that have purchased products within the last 12 months, increased by 15%.\nThe proportion of repeat customers fell slightly to 25.5% (FY25 H1: 26.6%) reflecting proportionally higher level of paid-for new customers following the insolvency of several competitors. Our level of repeat custom continues to be lower than in many other e-commerce sectors, reflecting the nature of the Group's product range and high average order value, and re-affirms the importance of the Group being profitable from the first customer transaction.\nOur email subscriber base increased by 0.2 million to 2.1 million. We are in the process of migrating to a new Customer Engagement Platform, designed to enhance customer retention and lifetime value through data-driven personalisation and targeted communications.\nWe continue to invest in our customer proposition and service teams, resulting in an excellent overall customer experience, reflected in Gear4music.com's Trustpilot score of 4.6/5 and 'Excellent' rating from over 138,000 reviews.\nProduct and Supply Chain\nFY26 H1\nFY25 H1\nChange on FY25 H1\nOwn-brand product sales\n\u00a317.2m\n\u00a313.8m\n+25%\nOther brand product sales\n\u00a360.3m\n\u00a345.3m\n+33%\nProduct margin\n32.1%\n30.9%\n+120bps\nProducts listed\n65,700\n63,300\n+4%\nBrands listed\n1,142\n1,111\n+3%\nAchieving strong gross margins is important to the profitability of the Group and a key business objective.

We continue to de-list less profitable, slow-moving SKUs.\nOwn-brand\nBuilding on last year's focus on brand and range development we have again increased our in-house team to enable us to create wider appeal and innovative product offering.\nThe number of own-brand SKUs increased from 5,510 at 30 September 2024 to 5,710 (+4%) at 30 September 2025, with own-brand revenue accounting for 22.2% of total product sales (FY24 H1: 23.3%) from 8.7% of total SKUs (FY25 H1: 8.7%), reflecting the significant on-going efforts of our in-house team in developing our range of high-quality instruments and equipment at affordable prices.\nProduct highlights include:\n-\nStudiospares brands re-launched following complete range overhaul;\n-\nLaunched Gear4music Life - a range of instruments and accessories to support mindfulness, sound therapy and creative exploration;\n-\nExpanded our Keynote pianos range to include new Keynote Junior models;\n-\nLaunched new Premier drum kits, snare drums, and accessories;\n-\nLaunched new Hartwood electric and acoustic Guitar ranges, as well as the brands first Bass Guitar ranges;\n-\nExpanded the Eden offering, with new Accessories and the introduction of the NovaTone range of heads and cabinets;\n-\nContinued expansion of the VISION range including additional VISIONAMP, VISIONPAD, and VISIONSTRING Mini; and\n-\nIn our AV.com business launched\nAVCOM 'centrepiece' products to complement the existing range of accessories and furniture.\nOur outsourced consolidation infrastructure in China enables us to increase SKU coverage across our distribution centres whilst minimising the working capital investment. This also helped maintain strong product margins.\nSoftware Development\nWe continue to leverage a combination of in-house capability with a team of 40 developers (30 September 2024: 32), and the outsourcing of one distinct project to external contractors.\nThe Group capitalised \u00a31.7m (FY25 H1: \u00a31.6m) in relation to its e-commerce platform in the Period including \u00a30.4m (FY25 H1: \u00a30.4m) of outsourced development that is now being wound-down as the new purchasing platform project approaches launch.\nRecent deployments include:\n-\nIntegrated with marketplace aggregator to create a scalable marketplace operation (Phase 1 delivered August 2025 and on-going);\n-\nPromo Centre creates the ability to create, manage and report on variety of promotions, including trade-ins (Phase 1 delivered October 2025 and on-going);\n-\nIntegrated with 3rd party to create a scalable Customer Engagement platform, allowing highly targeted marketing activities through a variety of channels.

In FY25 we reported 58% of our full year revenue in H2, but that will be difficult to repeat in FY26 due to warehouse capacity constraints in the peak trading weeks.\nUK revenue was 28% ahead of last year taking our estimated share of a flat UK market to 11.4% (FY25 H1: 9.7%). International revenues of \u00a331.1m were 35% up on last year reversing a 12% decrease in FY25 H1, reflecting improving trading conditions and increased marketing investment in Europe. International revenue accounted for 39% of the Group total revenue compared to 37% in FY25 H1.\nIn the Period we acquired the residual stock of GAK and PMT out of Administration and report \u00a31.9m revenue and \u00a31.1m gross profit on this stock. At 30 September 2025 we had \u00a31.4m related stock remaining.\nGross Margin and Gross Profit\nAs outlined in the 'Commercial Review' gross margin improved 150bps from 26.7% last year to 28.2%, reflecting a 120bps improvement in product margin, and a 30bps decrease in net delivery costs reflecting a higher AOV.\nOwn-brand product margin improved to 49.1% (FY25 H1: 47.4%) and branded-margin to 27.3% (FY25 H1: 25.9%). Own-brand revenue growth of 25% is very strong but lagged growth in branded-products which created an adverse mix effect.\nAs referenced above, we paid \u00a32.2m for certain stock out of the Administrations of GAK and PMT in the Period and report a \u00a31.1m gross profit on sale of \u00a30.8m of this stock, at a 59% gross margin. Adjusting to remove the upside on sales of this stock in the Period results in adjusted revenue of \u00a378.8m (+28% on FY25 H1), adjusted gross profit of \u00a321.6m (+31% on FY25 H1), and adjusted gross margin of 27.4% (+70bps on FY25 H1).\nOperating Profit and Administrative Expenses\nOperating profit of \u00a33.4m represents a \u00a33.9m improvement on FY25 H1, being the net of a \u00a36.2m increase in gross profit and a \u00a32.5m increase in Admin expenses.\nAdmin expenses increased 14% relative to a 31% increase in revenue reflecting an improved Marketing setup and returns and retaining wider cost control discipline. Admin expenses decreased from 28.1% of revenue in FY25 H1 to 24.6% in FY26 H1.\nMarketing and labour costs continue to be major components of our overhead base, accounting for a combined 63% of Admin expenses in the Period and in the prior year:\nMarketing\nMarketing costs of \u00a35.1m (FY25 H1: \u00a34.5m) equated to 6.4% of sales (FY25 H1: 7.3%) reflecting an improved team and set-up having resolved last year's issue with an outsourced marketing system, and improved market conditions.\nMarketing spend continues to be heavily PPC-focused, accounting for 86% of total marketing spend (FY25 H1: 88%) targeting a pre-defined and measurable return on investment.\nLabour costs\nTotal labour costs increased \u00a31.0m (14%) on FY25 H1 to \u00a37.4m reflecting:\n-\nFY26 H1 average headcount of 436 being 22 (5%) higher than FY25 H1; and\n-\nFY26 H1 average cost per head being 10% higher than FY25 H1.\nTotal headcount at 30 September 2025 of 470 is 36 (8%) higher than last year.\nOther Administrative expenses\nEuropean distribution centre local expenses increased \u00a30.1m (5%) on FY25 H1 to \u00a32.5m reflecting a \u00a30.1m increase in labour costs linked to increased activity.\nDepreciation and amortisation in the Period totalled \u00a33.5m (FY25 H1: \u00a33.4m) including amortisation of \u00a32.1m (FY25 H1: \u00a32.0m) relating to our bespoke e-commerce platform, and \u00a30.8m depreciation of 'Right of Use' assets (FY25 H1: \u00a30.8m).\nEBITDA\nWe report FY26 H1 EBITDA of \u00a36.9m which is \u00a34.0m (139%) higher than last year and equates to an EBITDA margin of 8.5% compared to 4.7% last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA to remove the gross profit impact of the sale of GAK and PMT stock in full is \u00a35.8m which is \u00a32.9m (100%) higher than last year and equates to an EBITDA margin of 7.3%.\nFinancial Expenses and Net Profit\nNet financial expenses of \u00a30.7m include \u00a30.5m net bank interest (FY25 H1: \u00a30.5m), and \u00a30.2m interest on lease liabilities (FY25 H1: \u00a30.2m).\nA tax charge of \u00a30.7m reflects an increase in taxable Group profits and includes a \u00a30.2m deferred tax expense.\nWe report a profit in the Period of \u00a32.0m compared to a \u00a31.2m loss in FY25 H1, equating to a basic profit per share of 9.6p (FY25 H1: 5.9p loss per share).\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nNet bank debt at 30 September 2025 was \u00a316.0m (FY25 H1: \u00a314.4m) reflects an additional \u00a310m investment in inventory to support sales growth, take advantage of opportunities, and bring stock in earlier to reduce pressure on our Distribution Centres during peak. In FY25 Q3 we dispatched stock with a cost value of \u00a332.1m.\nThis is a low point in the annual cash cycle as we invest in inventory ahead of peak seasonal trading. Nevertheless, this equates to just 1.1 times 12-month rolling EBITDA at 30 September 2025 (\u00a314.0m), and we continue to own our freehold head office with a net book value of \u00a36.2m.\nThis represents significant headroom of \u00a314.0m within the Group's \u00a330m RCF, and a marked reduction is expected by 31 March 2026 as seasonal increases in stock unwind and convert into cash.\nFY26 H1\nFY25 H1\nChange on FY25 H1\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\n\u00a3m\nOpening cash\n5.6\n4.7\n0.9\nNet cash used in Operating Activities\n(6.3)\n(3.8)\n(2.5)\nNet cash used in Investing Activities\n(1.8)\n(1.7)\n(0.1)\nNet cash from Financing Activities\n6.6\n7.4\n(0.8)\nClosing cash\n4.0\n6.6\n(2.6)\nNet bank debt\n(16.0)\n(14.4)\n(1.6)\nReported inventory of \u00a350.0m (FY25 H1: \u00a340.1m) includes \u00a38.7m of inbound stock-in-transit (FY25 H1: \u00a37.6m) as we pull-forward intake to provide certainty and reduce pressure during peak to focus on fulfilling orders. This is 25% higher than last year relative to a 31% increase in revenue.\nTrade and other payables of \u00a325.4m were \u00a34.3m (20%) higher than last year and includes \u00a31.4m of customer prepayments (30 September 2024: \u00a31.1m).\nCapitalised software development costs totalled \u00a31.7m in the Period (FY25 H1: \u00a31.6m) compared to amortisation of \u00a32.1m, resulting in a \u00a30.4m decrease in net book value since the start of the financial year.\nProperty, plant and equipment capital expenditure was limited to \u00a3138,000 in the Period (FY25 H1: \u00a3123,000).\nDividend Policy\nThe Board does not recommend the payment of a dividend (FY25 H1: nil).

Information\nGear4music (Holdings) plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and is listed on the Alternative Investment Market ('AIM') of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe Group financial information consolidates the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the \"Group\"). The Group has 100% owned trading subsidiaries in the UK ('Gear4music Limited'), Sweden ('Gear4music Sweden AB'), Germany ('Gear4music GmbH'), Ireland ('Gear4music Ireland Limited') and Spain ('Gear4music Spain S.L.'). The Group also has one 100% owned dormant subsidiary in the UK ('Cagney Limited').\nThe principal activity of the Group is the retail of musical instruments and equipment.\nThe registered office of Gear4music (Holdings) plc (company number: 07786708) and Gear4music Limited (company number: 03113256) is Holgate Park Drive, York, YO26 4GN.\n1\nAccounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated interim financial information, which has been neither audited nor reviewed by the auditor, has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for land and buildings that are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The condensed consolidated interim financial information does not constitute financial statements within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 and does not include all the information and disclosures required for full annual financial statements and is thus not in full compliance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. It should therefore be read in conjunction with the Group's Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025, which has been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Financial Reporting Standards and is available on the Group's investor website.\nThe accounting policies used in the financial information are consistent with those used in the Group's consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2025, as detailed on pages 75 to 80 of the Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, a copy of which is available on the Group's website, www.gear4musicplc.com.\nAs permitted, this interim report has been prepared in accordance with the AIM rules and not in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim financial reporting\".\nThe comparative financial information contained in the condensed consolidated financial information in respect of the year ended 31 March 2025 has been extracted from the 2025 Financial Statements. Those financial statements have been reported on by Grant Thornton UK LLP and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report was unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nSelected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Group since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at the year ended 31 March 2025.\nNotes to the Interim Financial Information (continued)\nGoing concern\nThe Group's business activities and position in the market, and principal risks, uncertainties and mitigations are described in detail in the Strategic Report included on pages 1 to 51 of the Group's 2025 Annual Report and Financial Statements.\nIn June 2025 the Group extended its RCF with HSBC at \u00a330m for a further one-year period to 15 June 2027. This facility provides a good and appropriate level of headroom that has been factored into the Directors going concern assessment.\nThe Group's policy is to ensure that it has sufficient facilities to cover its future funding requirements.\nAt 30 September 2025 the Group had net debt of \u00a316.0m (30 September 2024: \u00a314.4m) including \u00a34.0m cash (30 September 2024: \u00a36.6m), with a good and appropriate level of headroom that has also been factored into the Directors' going concern assessment.\nThe Directors have considered the Group's prospects based on its current proposition and online offering in\nthe UK and Europe, strategic developments delivered and in progress and concluded that there are significant opportunities for profitable growth as channel shift continues and customers move online.\nThere is a diverse supply chain with no key dependencies.\nHaving duly considered all these factors and having reviewed the forecasts for the period to 31 December 2026, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future, and as such continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\n2 Principal risks and uncertainties\nThe Board considers the principal risks and uncertainties which could impact the Group over the remaining six months of the financial year to 31 March 2026 to be unchanged from those set out in the group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, and can be summarised as:\n-\nIT and Cyber Security\n-\nWarehousing and Distribution\n-\nSupply chain\n-\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical factors\n-\nClimate risk and sustainability\n-\nUK outside the EU\n-\nChange management - Operational, Regulatory and Technological\n-\nBrand and proposition\n-\nCompetition\n-\nFinancial risk\n-\nESG\nThese are set out in detail on pages 44 to 49 of the Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, a copy of which is available on the Group's Plc website, www.gear4musicplc.com.\nNotes to the Interim Financial Information (continued)\n3\nSegmental analysis\nRevenue by Geography:\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2025\n6 months ended 30 September 2024\nYear ended31 March 2025\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nUK\n49,642\n38,711\n90,230\nEurope and Rest of the World\n31,105\n23,031\n56,490\n80,747\n61,742\n146,720\nAdministrative expenses by Geography:\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2025\n6 months ended 30 September 2024\nYear ended31 March 2025\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nUK\n17,367\n14,976\n32,605\nEurope and Rest of the World\n2,502\n2,384\n4,730\n19,869\n17,360\n37,335\nRevenue by Category:\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2025\n6 months ended 30 September 2024\nYear ended 31 March 2025\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nOther-brand products\n60,347\n45,334\n104,677\nOwn-brand products\n17,182\n13,787\n35,665\nCarriage income\n2,840\n2,382\n5,763\nWarranty income\n229\n172\n412\nOther\n149\n67\n203\n80,747\n61,742\n146,720\nNotes to the Interim Financial Information (continued)\n4\nExpenses and other income\nIncluded in profit/loss are the following:\n6 months ended 30 September\n2025\n6 months ended 30 September 2024\nYear ended31 March 2025\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n493\n539\n1,065\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets\n825\n817\n1,620\nAmortisation of intangible assets\n2,141\n2,008\n4,118\nLoss/(profit) on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n-\n1\n(5)\nR&D expenditure recognised as an expense\n65\n105\n126\nOther income\n6 months ended\n30 September\n2025\n6 months ended 30 September 2024\nYear ended 31 March 2025\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nRDEC tax credits\n182\n156\n390\nRental income\n201\n115\n289\nOther\n154\n103\n231\nTotal other income\n537\n374\n910\nRental income relates to our freehold Head Office in York and sublet of part of our Spanish distribution centre.
