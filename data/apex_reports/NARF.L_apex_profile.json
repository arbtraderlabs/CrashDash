ON PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n9 October 2023\nNARF INDUSTRIES PLC\nAwarded $1.8 Million US Healthcare Cyber Security Contract\nProactive Approach to Malware Risk in Electronic Health Records (\"EHR\")\nNarf Industries plc (\"\nNarf\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\", or the \"\nGroup\n\"), (\nLSE:\nNARF\n) (\nOTCQB: NFIN.F\n) the cybersecurity group specializing in high-end threat intelligence and critical infrastructure security, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a $1.8 million contract from the US Government's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).\nUnder this contract awarded by ARPA-H, NARF will work on the Digital Health Security (DIGIHEALS\n[i]\n) programme titled \"Electronic Health Record Format for Interoperable Secure Transformation (EHR-FIST)\". This work leverages NARF's cutting-edge capabilities developed under its multi-million dollar SAFEDOC's contracts sponsored by another leading government agency, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (\"DARPA\").\nThe DIGIHEALS initiative\nsupports innovative research that aims to protect the U.S. health care system's electronic infrastructure against hostile threats. SAFEDOCS has the same goal, but focused on standard business document formats, like PDFs. The complexities in these file format\ncreate opportunities for attackers to hide malicious code. In the case of DIGIHEALS, the hundreds of health care management software applications that process EHR are vulnerable to these advanced threats and put hospitals and patients at risk from ransomware and disruption of health services.\nNARF is advancing innovative capabilities that detects malware risk buried deep within complex document structures before its launched and used by applications that can then infect critical infrastructure networks. Under these research agency funded contracts, NARF owns the intellectual property (IP) for commercial purposes and is constructing an array of disruptive advanced threat detection capabilities to form a next generation threat intelligence platform.\nDr. Michael Locasto, Director, NARF Government Research and Development (GR&D) Sector commented.\n\"\nThese research agencies rely on NARF's game changing approaches to keep pace with evolving threats. This is our inaugural contract with ARPA-H and we are now working to expand our relationships across the many other government and private research agencies involved in critical infrastructure security.\"\nSteve Bassi, CEO of NARF commented:\n\"\nIt's the cumulative value and synergistic nature of these incremental research awards that's important to recognize in NARF's strategy to leverage non-dilutive research work into commercial products. Over 75% of this year's revenue, multi-million dollars, is directly contributing to our IP pipeline and creating the foundation for a new generation of threat intelligence and vulnerability solutions.\"\nFor further information on the Group please visit\nwww.narfgroup.com\nor contact:\nJohn Herring\nNARF\njh@narfgroup.com\nCatherine Leftley/Paul Dulieu /Isabel de Salis\nSt Brides Partners\nnarf@stbridespartners.co.uk\nPeter Krens\nTennyson Securities\nTel: +44 (0)207 186 9030\nAbout NARF Industries plc\nNarf Industries (\nLSE: NARF\n)(\nOTCQB: NFIN.F\n) is a US based leading provider of cybersecurity research, solutions, and services to government entities.

The Company subsequently shifted its strategic focus, reallocating resources to address the rising demand for cybersecurity solutions specifically targeting vulnerabilities in the open-source software supply chain. This adjustment was underscored by the April 2024 discovery of a backdoor in XZ Utils (see RNS dated 1 May 2024), which highlighted the critical need for enhanced security in open-source software.\nThe Company is pleased to report that its change in strategic direction to focus resources on the development of its Social Cyber platform has progressed in a balanced and positive manner and is being achieved within its existing capital resources. Narf remains financially stable while positioning itself for the significant upside that its Social Cyber platform promises.\nSocial Cyber Resource Allocation\nAn earlier-than-expected $1.3 million Social Cyber contract award for work with the Air Force's Platform 1/Iron Bank has helped offset part of the Company's planned resource allocation for the development of its Social Cyber platform. This external funding has directly supported its product development, allowing the Company to stretch its internal resources further, while staying on track with its development timeline.\nGovernment Traction with Social Cyber Platform Opportunity\nThe reallocation of resources toward the Company's Social Cyber platform required a shift of focus from other government programmes, making it crucial that the Company should gain meaningful traction for its Social Cyber platform within its government customer base. The Company is pleased to report that this traction is building on the back of the Platform1/Iron Bank contract and that the Company's Social Cyber platform is beginning to generate opportunities that over the next 12 months are projected to surpass those it would otherwise have achieved from government contracts it set aside.\nSocial Cyber Spin-Off\nWith solid traction among government customers and having demonstrated the AI technologies and capabilities within its Social Cyber platform, the Company is seeing interest from industry partners regarding potential investment, expanding market opportunities and the acceleration of commercialising Narf's Social Cyber platform with a more lucrative Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") revenue model. The Company therefore believes it is on track to achieving its objective of entering a joint venture partnership with strategic partners in early 2025.\nFINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nThe Company has experienced some budget funding delays from its U.S. government clients in respect to existing contracts and the granting of some new contract awards until the budget was finalised. These delays, combined with rising awareness of threats to the global open-source software supply chain, provided the Company with the capacity to accelerate the development and commercialisation of its Social Cyber platform.\nWith the U.S. budget now approved, the Company expects to receive a number of new contract awards in the coming months. Additionally, it has expanded its government client base by partnering with established defence and intelligence contractors, which have strong government relationships and will help mitigate similar government budget approval risks in the future.\nNarf projects that revenue for the year ending 31 March 2025 will be not less than $5 million, with the Company broadly at cash flow break-even at the FY end. For the following year ending 31 March 2026, the Company anticipates revenue of not less than $8 million, having fully navigated any impact from last year's U.S. budget delays. This guidance does not include a significant contribution from our Social Cyber platform development, and we would be disappointed not to see some incremental revenues from this platform over the next financial year.\nSteve Bassi, President and CEO of Narf Industries said: \"We are continuing to make good progress in targeting new opportunities in the area of Social Cyber and extending the capabilities to create a new generation AI Powered DevSecOps platform (see below). This is expanding our government opportunities and driving growing interest from strategic partners as we work to finalize our joint venture in early CY25.\"\nABOUT NARF'S SOCIAL CYBER PLATFORM\nNarf's Social Cyber platform introduces a groundbreaking approach to integrating security earlier in the software development lifecycle, addressing a critical need in development operations (\"DevOps\") environments where security often takes a back seat to speed and efficiency. Traditionally, security checks occur late in the pipeline, creating delays and vulnerabilities that disrupt workflows and require costly reworks. Narf's Social Cyber platform changes this dynamic by embedding advanced instrumentation and observability (\"I&O\") into the pipeline itself and providing AI powered real-time threat detection and proactive risk management without slowing down development. This approach not only ensures a more secure software supply chain but also allows DevOps teams to maintain the agility and pace they rely on, making Narf's Social Cyber platform a valuable asset for organisations seeking seamless, early-stage security integration.\nFor further information visit www.narfgroup.com or contact:\nNarf Industries plc\nJohn Herring\njh@narfgroup.com\nJoint Broker\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\nSimon Bridges\nHarry Rees\nTel: +44 (0) 207 523 8000\nJoint Broker\nTennyson Securities plc\nPeter Krens\nTel: +44 (0)207 186 9030\nFinancial PR, UK\nSt Brides Partners\nPaul Dulieu\nIsabel de Salis\nnarf@stbridespartners.co.uk\nAbout NARF Industries plc\nNarf Industries (LSE: NARF) is a U.S. based leading provider of cybersecurity research, solutions, and services to government entities.

This three year contract, under DARPA's Intelligent Generation of Tools for Security (\"INGOTS\") programme, aims to identify and address high-severity, chainable vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThree year, US$6.8 million multi-phase contract commencing 31 January 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Company expects to recognise circa US$2.6 million of revenue for the first phase of the contract in its financial year ending 31 March 2026.\n\u00b7\nThree future phases are scheduled to commence on 31 January 2026 and 2027 and are valued at $1.67 million, $1.24 million, and $1.3 million, respectively.\n\u00b7\nRevenue for the future phases is expected to be recognised in the Company's financial year following the completion of each stage.\n\u00b7\nProgression to future phases is subject to programme and budgetary requirements and successful milestones being achieved.\n\u00b7\nThis contract will support the development of Narf's advanced system that simulates multi-step cyberattacks, helping customers identify and address vulnerabilities within their organisations.\n\u00b7\nThe first phase will see Narf develop prototypes of its system for customer evaluation, paving the way for government and commercial opportunities as the technology matures.\nSteve Bassi, President and CEO said:\n\"We are delighted to be part of DARPA's pioneering INGOTS programme, reaffirming Narf's commitment to safeguarding critical systems against sophisticated and evolving cyber threats. This significant US$6.8 million multi-phase contract enables us to further develop our system that goes beyond merely identifying vulnerabilities but represents a fundamental shift in cybersecurity strategy. By simulating real-world attack tactics, our technology will empower organisations to anticipate and counter emerging threats, ensuring stronger protection for their assets and infrastructure.\"\nFurther information\nWith the increasing complexity of modern software ecosystems, securing digital infrastructure has become a paramount challenge. Vulnerabilities are no longer isolated to single systems, but often span interconnected platforms, operating systems, and devices. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities by creating intricate attack chains, leveraging weaknesses across the software stack to breach defences.\nTo address these challenges and identify and fix high-severity, chainable vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them, DARPA, a US Government agency, launched the INGOTS programme.\nAs part of this programme, DARPA has awarded Narf a contract to further develop its innovative system, which simulates real-world, multi-step attack chains in a controlled environment.\nNarf expects to recognise approximately US$2.6 million in revenue from the contract in its financial year ending 31 March 2026. Three future stages are scheduled to commence on 31 January 2026 and 2027 and are valued at $1.67 million, $1.24 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. Revenue for the future stages is expected to be recognised in the Company's financial year following the completion of each stage. Progression to the subsequent stages is subject to programme and budgetary requirements and successful milestones being achieved.\nBy identifying weaknesses at every stage, Narf's system enables security teams to proactively address threats before they can be exploited. A key strength of the system is its adaptability. In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, platforms such as Android undergo frequent updates, with vulnerabilities being patched and new ones emerging. Narf's system automatically adapts to these changes, detecting where attack chains are disrupted and seamlessly identifying alternative pathways to continue rigorous testing. This dynamic approach ensures continuous, up-to-date protection for critical software and systems.\nDuring the first phase of the contract, Narf will develop early prototypes of its system for evaluation by potential customers. As the technology matures, it is expected to unlock opportunities with both government and commercial organisations.\nENDS\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract No. HR001125C0013.
