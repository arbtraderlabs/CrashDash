The two-year contract spans the current and next financial years and focuses on developing novel approaches to accelerate computer system recovery after cyber-attacks.\nGovernment demand for next-generation cyber resilience solutions continues to increase as agencies seek to incorporate AI, enhance system reliability, and reduce recovery times across critical missions. These structural tailwinds are creating sustained opportunities for organizations delivering applied innovation in support of national security objectives. Against this backdrop, the contract awarded to Narf by the U.S. government R&D agency reflects the Company's strong alignment with these priorities.\nNarf also moved early to position itself with another major shift in the government R&D market: the growing emphasis on research that can transition rapidly into operational capability. By advancing proposals centered on applied, mission-aligned research with clear transition routes, the Company has differentiated its position within this evolving landscape.\nThis latest award reinforces Narf's competitive strength\nand supports its progression toward larger, strategically significant programs.\nSteve Bassi, CEO of Narf Industries, commented: \"\nThis award and Narf's advancement into larger mission-aligned research programs demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy to use government-funded innovation as the foundation for scalable capabilities. With total awards now exceeding $10 million, Narf is generating the cash flow necessary to mature and scale these efforts, including the continued development of Ranger.ai. Opportunities for Ranger.ai are progressing well, and we expect to secure initial contract awards in Q1 2026.\"\nENDS\nFor further information visit\nwww.narfgroup.com\nor contact:\nNarf Industries plc\nJohn Herring\njh@narfgroup.com\nBroker\nTennyson Securities plc\nPeter Krens\nTel: +44 (0)207 186 9030\nFinancial PR, UK\nSt Brides Partners\nPaul Dulieu\nIsabel de Salis\nnarf@stbridespartners.co.uk\nAbout NARF Industries plc\nNarf Industries (LSE: NARF) is a U.S. based leading provider of cybersecurity research, solutions, and services to government entities.

ON PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n17 November 2025\nNARF INDUSTRIES PLC\nINTERIM RESULTS AND NOTICE OF INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nNarf Industries plc (\"\nNarf\n\", the \"\nCompany\n\", or the \"\nGroup\n\"), (\nLSE: NARF\n) the cybersecurity group specializing in high-end threat intelligence and critical infrastructure security, today announces its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 September 2025 (\"HY2025\"). The Company also confirms details of the forthcoming Investor Presentation.\nHY 2025 Highlights\n\u00b7\nRevenue increased 74% to $2.05m (HY2024: $1.18m), reflecting continued strength in the Government Research and Development segment (GR&D) with larger contract awards including DARPA's INGOTS program (see RNS: 6 March 2025).\n\u00b7\nLoss for the period reduced significantly by 70% to $555,145 (HY2024 loss: $1,868,916), supported by an improved pipeline of contracted business and strong cost control.\n\u00b7\nFinancial stability maintained, with continued reduction in overhead costs and cash at period end increased by 65% to $224,512 (HY2024: $135,725) without recourse to the CEO loan facility.\n\u00b7\nRanger.ai achieved\nAwardable\nstatus on the US DoD's Platform One (P1) Marketplace, enabling fast-track access to federal procurement channels resulting in advanced discussions with several potential Ranger.ai clients.\n\u00b7\nCEO loan facility extended to July 2026, providing flexibility for growth and working capital needs.\nPost Period End\n\u00b7\nNo material impact from recent U.S. Government shutdown.\nChairman's Statement\nThe first half of the year saw solid operational progress and continued execution of Narf's strategy to advance its government-funded research segment (GR&D) business and transition promising capabilities into scalable, enterprise-ready cybersecurity products (Ranger.ai).\nThe Company's GR&D strategy now targets research opportunities that provide a more direct and accelerated transition to government SaaS systems, leveraging Agentic AI technology as a core capability. Building on our reputation for bringing a mission-focused approach to research and expanding our AI expertise, the Company is increasingly well positioned for larger, higher-value work in this market segment.\nThe Company's decision last year to focus its Government Systems and Services (GS&S) sector on building a product team to bring Ranger.ai to market, and to move away from lower-margin government work, remains on track. This strategic shift inevitably impacted short-term GS&S revenue; however, as reported below, early signs of Ranger.ai market traction reinforce our confidence that it was the right decision for the Company and its shareholders.\nRanger.ai\nAwardable\ndesignation on the U.S. Department of Defense's Platform One Marketplace marks a defining step for the Company. It signifies that our technology has successfully transitioned from research into a\nmission-ready\ncapability - clear proof that our productization efforts have delivered. Equally important, it provides a fast-track procurement path for other government agencies, dramatically shortening the time to operational adoption.\nOur GS&S Ranger.ai team is currently engaged across multiple government opportunities, directly and through major system integrators. We anticipate initial awards in the first quarter of calendar year 2026 with meaningful revenue contributions beginning in our 2027 financial year, which commences on 1 April 2026.\nWe continue to monitor U.S. Government shutdown developments closely.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our employees, partners, and shareholders for their continued support. I am confident that the management team's efforts will continue to yield improved results as Narf builds further momentum, progressing innovation to enterprise solutions.\nJohn Herring\nExecutive Chairman\nInvestor Presentation\nThe Company will host an Interim Results & Operational Update presentation via Investor Meet Company on:\nTuesday 9 December 2025 at 14:00 GMT.\nThe presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders. Questions can be submitted pre-event via the Investor Meet Company dashboard up until 09:00 GMT on Monday 8 December 2025, or at any time during the live presentation.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add to meet Narf Industries plc via:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/narf-industries-plc/register-investor\nInvestors who already follow Narf Industries plc on the Investor Meet Company platform will automatically be invited.\nDIRECTORS REPORT AND STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE CONDENSED INTERIM REPORT AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe results of the Group have been addressed above in the Chairman's statement.

2024\n1.\nOrganisation and Trading Activities\nThe principal activity of Narf Industries plc (the \"Company'') together with its operating subsidiaries (together, the \"Group\") is high-end threat intelligence. Its strategy is focussed on building a group capable of offering cybersecurity solutions in the US and beyond. The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated and registered in England and Wales as a public limited company. The Company's registered office is 5 Fleet Place, London EC4M 7RD. The Company's registered number is 11701224.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe principal accounting policies adopted and applied in the preparation of these interim Group Financial statements are set out below.\nThese have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated:\nB\nasis of accounting\nThese interim financial statements of Narf Industries\nplc\n(the \"Group\") have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards (\"UK-adopted IAS\") applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on the basis of the accounting policies as set out in the Group's audited annual financial statements and are presented in US Dollars, the presentational and functional currency of the Group. The Group has applied IAS 34 in the preparation of these interim financial statements.\nThis announcement was approved and authorised by the Board of directors on 12 November 2025. Copies of this interim report can be found on the Company's website at\nhttps://narfgroup.com/investor-relations/corporate-document\nThese condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2025 are unaudited and do not constitute fully prepared statutory accounts. The comparative figures for the year ended 31 March 2025 are extracted from the 2025 consolidated financial statements of the Company. The independent auditor's report on the 2025 financial statements opinion was qualified principally due to the inability to gain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence in respect of the opening balances at 1 January 2023 and the potential impact that would have on the comparative numbers in the income statement.\nG\noing concern\nAny consideration of the foreseeable future involves making a judgement, at a particular point in time, about future events which are inherently uncertain. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts covering the period to 31 December 2026. The Chief Executive has agreed not to demand repayment of his loan until the Group has sufficient cash resources to repay it, whilst those members of senior management who had accepted salary deferrals have agreed to accept repayment of those deferrals over an extended period such that revenues are expected to be sufficient for the Group to settle the outstanding amounts. The forecasts accordingly, indicate that the Group will have sufficient cash resources to meet all foreseeable liabilities, other than those relating to the loan to the Chief Executive, through to a period which is at least twelve months after the issue of these condensed interim financial statements\nAccordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to meet any future obligations and thus to continue operating for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the interim financial statements.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies (contiNUED)\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Financial Statements consolidate the financial information of the Company and companies controlled by the Group (its subsidiaries) at each reporting date following the acquisition in March 2022.\nControl is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity, has the rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the financial information from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. The financial statements of all Group companies are adjusted, where necessary, to ensure the use of consistent accounting policies.\nThe Financial Statements consolidate the financial information of the Company and companies controlled by the Group (its subsidiaries) at each reporting date.\n3.\nEARNINGS per Share\nThe basic earnings per share is based on the loss for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. Since the Group has made a loss in the current and each of the prior periods, the options and warrants in issue are not dilutive.\nSix months to\n30 Sept 2025\nUS$\nSix months to\n30 Sept 2024\nUS$\nYear to\n31 Mar 2025\nUS$\nLoss attributable to owners of the Group :\n(554,446)\n(1,831,773)\n(3,560,867)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for basic earnings\n1,697,381,100\n1,697,381,100\n1,697,381,100\nWeighted average number of shares in issue for fully diluted earnings\n1,697,381,100\n1,697,381,100\n1,697,381,100\nLOSS PER SHARE (CENTS PER SHARE)\n(0.03)\n(0.11)\n(0.21)\nBASIC AND FULLY DILUTED:\n- from continuing and total operations (cents)\n(0.03)\n(0.11)\n(0.21)\n4.\nShare capital AND SHARE PREMIUM\nThe following table is presented in US Dollar equivalents:\nOrdinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each\nNumber\nShare Capital\n$\nShare Premium\n$\nAt 1 October 2024\n1,697,381,000\n204,012\n35,294,816\nAt 31 March 2025\n1,697,381,000\n204,012\n35,294,816\nAt 30 September 2024\n1,697,381,000\n204,012\n35,294,816\n5.\nPost period end events\nThere were no significant events subsequent to the balance sheet date which have any bearing on these interim financial statements.\nENDS\nFor further information on the Group please visit www.narfgroup.com or contact:\nJohn Herring\nNARF\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3468 2212\nCatherine Leftley/Charlotte Page/Isabel de Salis\nSt Brides Partners\nnarf@stbridespartners.co.uk\nPeter Krens\nTennyson Securities\nTel: +44 (0)207 186 9030\nAbout NARF Industries plc\nNarf Industries (\nLSE: NARF\n) is a US based cyber security group specialising in high-end threat intelligence with a focus on critical infrastructure.
