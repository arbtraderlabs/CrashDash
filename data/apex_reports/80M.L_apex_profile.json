With multiple projects in Greenland, as well as a developing industrial gas and biofuels business in Italy, 80 Mile offers both portfolio and commodity diversification focused on base metals, precious metals, and industrial gas while expanding into sustainable fuels and clean energy solutions in Tier 1 jurisdictions. 80 Mile's strategy is centred on advancing key projects while creating value through partnerships and strategic acquisitions.\n80 Mile's acquisition of White Flame Energy and the Jameson licenses in East Greenland has positioned the Company in one of the world's most compelling undrilled hydrocarbon basins. Under its agreement with March GL, drilling of two fully funded wells is set to commence, with Pelican Acquisition Corporation's merger with Greenland Exploration valuing 80 Mile's retained 30% interest in Jameson at approximately US$92 million. This acquisition and partnership significantly expand 80 Mile's exposure to the energy sector while advancing its strategy of developing both conventional and sustainable energy opportunities.\nThe Disko-Nuussuaq nickel-copper-cobalt-PGE project in Greenland is a primary focus for 80 Mile, 100% owned by 80 Mile PLC. Seven priority targets exhibiting spatial characteristics indicative of potential deposits on a scale comparable to renowned mining operations such as Norilsk, Voisey's Bay, and Jinchuan, will be advanced by the Company.\nThe Dundas Ilmenite Project, 80 Mile's most advanced asset in northwest Greenland, is fully with a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 117 Mt at 6.1% ilmenite and an offshore Exploration Target of up to 530 Mt. Dundas is poised to become a major supplier of high-quality ilmenite. Recent discoveries of hard rock titanium mineralisation, with bedrock samples showing nearly double the ilmenite content of previous estimates, further enhance the project's world-class potential. 80 Mile owns 100% of the Dundas Ilmenite Project under its subsidiary Dundas Titanium A/S in Greenland.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

('Amaroq', AIM, TSXV, NASDAQ Iceland: AMRQ). This follows the announcements of\n11 August 2025\nand\n12 June 2025\n.\nAs a result of this approval, the transaction is now complete, and 80 Mile will receive 392,939 Amaroq AIM shares, equating to US$500,000. As previously announced, the Company will also receive US$1,500,000 in cash or shares upon the discovery of a JORC or NI 43-101 compliant resource that supports development.\nThis transaction reflects 80 Mile's ongoing strategy to monetise non-core assets and focus on its priority projects, particularly the Disko-Nuussuaq nickel-copper-cobalt project, Hydrogen Valley, and the Jameson Land Basin Project. The proceeds will be directed toward advancing these core assets and further strategic initiatives.\nKangerluarsuk is a high-grade carbonate-hosted zinc-lead-silver project located on Greenland's west coast, within the historic Black Angel mining district. 80 Mile identified multiple untested geophysical anomalies on the property that are consistent with the style of mineralisation that supported historical production in the district.\nAmaroq Minerals is a well-capitalised and technically proficient Greenland-focused explorer and developer, and 80 Mile is confident that their team is well-placed to unlock the value of the project through systematic exploration. Amaroq have announced this purchase and a proposed fundraising of \u00a330.0 million in the announcement which can be found\nhere\n.\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.80mile.com\nor contact:\nRod McIllree\n80 Mile plc\nenquiry@80mile.com\nEwan Leggat / Devik Mehta\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Andrew de Andrade\nZeus Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nMegan Ray / Said Izagaren\nBlytheRay(Media Contact)\n+44 (0) 20 7138 3204\n80mile@blytheray.com\nAbout 80\u00a0Mile Plc:\n80 Mile Plc, listed on the London AIM market, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the U.S. OTC Market under the ticker BLLYF, is an exploration and development company focused on high-grade critical metals in Tier 1 jurisdictions.
