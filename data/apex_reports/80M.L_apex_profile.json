          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "9 Jul 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 2345Q\n80 Mile PLC\n09 July 2025\n9 July 2025\nGreenswitch Memorandum of Understanding with Tecnoparco\n80 Mile Moves to 49% Interest in Hydrogen Valley\n80 Mile PLC (\"80 Mile\" or the \"Company\"), the AIM, FSE listed and OTC traded exploration and development Company, is pleased to provide an update on Greenswitch Srl ('Greenswitch'), a subsidiary of Hydrogen Valley Ltd ('Hydrogen Valley' or 'HV') in which 80 Mile has an interest. The Company also announces its increased interest in Hydrogen Valley to 49%.\nGreenswitch Memorandum of Understanding with Tecnoparco\nGreenswitch has signed a Memorandum of Understanding ('MOU') with Tecnoparco Valbasento ('Tecnoparco') for the procurement of up to 40,000 tonnes per year ('tpa') of biofuel from Greenswitch, for use in its cogeneration units. At present, Tecnoparco imports palm oil from outside of Italy, so this agreement would not only shorten the supply chain and reduce Tecnoparco's shipping costs, but also help to increase its sustainability credentials by moving away from palm oil. The MOU is in respect of an initial 40,000 tpa of biofuel, but this number could increase if Tecnoparco decides to include its affiliate industrial operators.\nTecnoparco is a multi-utility focused on providing services and utilities to its industrial customers based in the Region of Basilicata. Services include water treatment, and the supply of natural gas, electricity, steam, and other products. Tecnoparco was formed in 1990 as a public-private endeavour to help promote the development of industry in the Valbasento area of Basilicata. The company is located in the town of Pisticci, only a few kilometres from Greenswitch's biofuel plant.\nGreenswitch believes this could be the first MOU of several to be signed in the coming months, as there are a growing number of refineries in Italy that are planning to introduce a percentage requirement of biofuel for mixing purposes with crude oil for the production of various products.\n80 Mile Increases Interest in Hydrogen Valley to 49%\n80 Mile announced on\n19 December 2024\nthat it has the option to acquire up to a 100% interest in Hydrogen Valley, and moved to a 24% interest, as announced on\n16 January 2025\n. Further to this, the Company is pleased to announce that it has now moved to a 49% interest in Hydrogen Valley after renegotiating the terms for the exercise of the Stage 3 option. The Company and the vendors of HV have agreed that no shares of 80 Mile would be issued for the exercise of the Stage 3 option and the cash consideration reduced from \u00a31 million to \u00a3380,000, which will be settled by the novation of a \u00a3380,000 working capital loan, that has been provided to HV, to satisfy the consideration due to the vendors of HV. The Company has saved significant funds and minimised shareholder dilution by renegotiating the terms of Stage 3. The Stage 4 option remains unchanged at this time. Further short term financing of Hydrogen Valley will be subject to 15% interest.\nEric Sondergaard, Managing Director of 80 Mile, commented:\n\"\nWe are pleased to see this development by Greenswitch to sign an MOU for the sale of up to 40,000 tpa of biofuel to Tecnoparco. This agreement is expected to be a win-win for both Greenswitch and Tecnoparco, as it will lead to the sale of some of Greenswitch's biofuel to a local company, and for Tecnoparco, it will help to address the need for a cleaner alternative to the palm oil that it currently imports, from a supplier that is located only a few kilometres away. It is exciting to hear of the potential opportunities for similar agreements to arise in the coming months, and we look forward to keeping shareholders up to date with any news.\n\"\nI am also delighted to announce that 80 Mile has now moved to a 49% interest in Hydrogen Valley, as we continue to expand in the sustainable and renewable energy markets through the integration of Greenswitch into our portfolio. We now have the option to increase to 100% between the period from 20 December 2025 up until 20 December 2026, and we will provide any updates accordingly.\n\"\nFor further information, please visit\nhttp://www.80mile.com\nor contact:\nEric Sondergaard\n80 Mile plc\nenquiry@80mile.com\nEwan Leggat / Devik Mehta\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Andrew de Andrade\nZeus Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nMegan Ray / Said Izagaren\nBlytheRay(Media Contact)\n+44 (0) 20 7138 3204\n80mile@blytheray.com\nAbout 80\u00a0Mile Plc:\n80 Mile Plc, listed on the London AIM market, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the U.S. OTC Market under the ticker BLLYF, is an exploration and development company focused on high-grade critical metals in Tier 1 jurisdictions. With multiple projects in Greenland, as well as a developing industrial gas and biofuels business in Italy, 80 Mile offers both portfolio and commodity diversification focused on base metals, precious metals, and industrial gas while expanding into sustainable fuels and clean energy solutions in Tier 1 jurisdictions. 80 Mile's strategy is centred on advancing key projects while creating value through partnerships and strategic acquisitions.\n80 Mile's recent acquisition of White Flame Energy and the Jameson licenses expands its portfolio into the energy and gas sector, adding large-scale licenses for industrial gas, natural gas, and liquids in East Greenland. Approved by shareholders in July 2024, this acquisition diversifies the Company's assets and aligns with its strategy to contribute to sustainable energy solutions, while also exploring conventional energy resources.\nThe Disko-Nuussuaq nickel-copper-cobalt-PGE project in Greenland is a primary focus for 80 Mile, 100% owned by 80 Mile PLC. Seven priority targets exhibiting spatial characteristics indicative of potential deposits on a scale comparable to renowned mining operations such as Norilsk, Voisey's Bay, and Jinchuan, will be advanced by the Company.\nThe Dundas Ilmenite Project, 80 Mile's most advanced asset in northwest Greenland, is fully with a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 117 Mt at 6.1% ilmenite and an offshore Exploration Target of up to 530 Mt. Dundas is poised to become a major supplier of high-quality ilmenite. Recent discoveries of hard rock titanium mineralization, with bedrock samples showing nearly double the ilmenite content of previous estimates, further enhance the project's world-class potential. 80 Mile owns 100% of the Dundas Ilmenite Project under its subsidiary Dundas Titanium A/S in Greenland.\nIn June 2025, 80 Mile entered into a definitive agreement to divest its 100% interest in the Kangerluarsuk zinc-lead-silver project in Greenland to Amaroq Minerals Ltd. Under the terms of the agreement, 80 Mile will receive US$500,000 in Amaroq Minerals shares upon completion, and US$1,500,000 in cash or shares upon the discovery of an economic deposit, as defined by a JORC or NI 43-101 compliant resource that supports development.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Metals One has informed 80 Mile that it is not continuing with the acquisition of FinnAust Mining so that it can prioritise exploration expenditure on its US based critical mineral projects.\nBackground\nIn July 2023, Metals One acquired the entire issued share capital of FinnAust Mining Northern Oy ('FinnAust Northern') from 80 Mile (the '2023 FinnAust Transaction'). FinnAust Northern holds the Black Schist Project in Finland. As announced on 31 July 2023, elements of the consideration payable by Metals One to 80 Mile for the acquisition of FinnAust Northern were deferred and would have become payable in the future ('FinnAust Deferred Consideration Shares').\nIn March and April 2025, 80 Mile executed a Share Purchase Agreement with Metals One for the conditional sale of the entire issued share capital of FinnAust Mining Finland Mining Oy ('FinnAust Mining') from 80 Mile (the '2025 FinnAust Transaction'). FinnAust Mining holds certain licences comprising the Hammaslahti Copper-Zinc Project ('Hammaslahti') and Outokumpu Copper Project in Finland ('Outokumpu').\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the payment to 80 Mile of \u00a3150,000 cash and costs incurred in connection with the 2025 FinnAust Transaction, the parties have agreed to terminate the 2025 FinnAust Transaction and for no further consideration to be payable to 80 Mile in respect of the 2023 FinnAust Transaction (including the FinnAust Deferred Consideration Shares).\nAccordingly, 80 Mile has been advised that Metals One has decided that it will not continue with the intended acquisition of the Hammaslahti and Outokumpu projects due to a focus on US based critical minerals and the ability to attract government funding for such.\nThe Company is no longer entitled to appoint a director to the Board of Metals One and therefore Metals One will not continue with the appointment of Olga Solovieva as announced on 17 April 2025.\nUpdate Regarding 80 Mile's Interest in Metals One\n80 Mile announces an amendment to the notification made on 19 May 2025 in connection with the sale of the Company's interest in the ordinary shares of Metals One Plc ('Metals One') together with additional information.\nThe Company disposed of its interest in 6,250,000 ordinary shares of Metals One in a series of share sales which commenced on 4 April 2025, with the final sale occurring on 9 May 2025 ('Share Sale'). The total proceeds from the Share Sale were \u00a31,739,006, not the previously notified figure of \u00a31,970,000. Separately, the Company received a cash payment of \u00a3230,994 from Metals One, which related to the sale of FinnAust Mining Finland Oy (further details of which were set out in the announcements made by 80 Mile on 19 March 2025 and 3 April 2025).\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information set out above is provided in accordance with the requirements of Article 19(3) of the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.80mile.com\nor contact:\nEric Sondergaard\n80 Mile plc\nenquiry@80mile.com\nEwan Leggat / Adam Cowl\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP(Nominated Adviser and Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nHarry Ansell / Katy Mitchell / Andrew de Andrade\nZeus Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nMegan Ray / Said Izagaren\nBlytheRay(Media Contact)\n+44 (0) 20 7138 3204\n80mile@blytheray.com\nAbout 80\u00a0Mile Plc:\n80 Mile Plc, listed on the London AIM market, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the U.S. OTC Market under the ticker BLLYF, is an exploration and development company focused on high-grade critical metals in Tier 1 jurisdictions.
