          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 6737P\nOptiBiotix Health PLC\n21 January 2026\nOptiBiotix Health plc\n(\"OptiBiotix\" or the \"Company\" or \"the Group\")\nLarge order and Record Early Orders for 2026\nOptiBiotix Health plc (AIM: OPTI, OTCQB: OPTBF), a life sciences business developing products which reduce hunger and food cravings, enhance the gut microbiome, and sweet fibres as healthy sugar substitutes, announces that it has received four orders totalling twenty-four metric tonnes (24mt) of SlimBiome from Meelung Trading, Taiwan (\"Meelung\"). These orders will be delivered at approximately three-month intervals throughout 2026 when they will be recorded in the Company's management accounts and reported for the 12 months ended 31 December 2026 (\"FY2026\").\nMeelung started trading in 1949 as a pharmaceutical company before expanding into nutraceuticals in 1992 to exploit the growing market opportunity. It describes itself as one of the most important nutritional supplement distributors in Taiwan with a focus on patented, branded products with clinical studies. OptiBiotix signed an agreement with Meelung in June 2025 and has seen rapid sales growth with regular recurring orders of increasing size.\nThese orders reflect a growing confidence in SlimBiome and a growing trend with an increasing number of partners placing orders for FY2026 to secure supply. This enables OptiBiotix to plan ahead and consolidate multiple orders, allowing it to negotiate preferential pricing with suppliers and reduce cost. The Company gains flexibility to pass on any cost savings to partners for larger orders while maintaining or improving margins, supporting increased sales growth.\nThis approach has delivered a record start to FY2026, with over \u00a3800K in orders secured from four partners. These will be delivered at various point throughout FY2026 when they will be recorded and reported in the Company's FY2026 accounts. These are confirmed orders with a no cancellation clause and includes the low six figure order received in November 2025 from a well-known weight management company (RNS: 17 November 2025) planned for delivery and launch in H1 2026, the Meelung orders, and two other partners.\nThese confirmed orders reflect the growing interest in ingredients like SlimBiome which support hunger control and appetite reduction similar to the anti-obesity drugs. This alternative GLP1 market is new and fast evolving and estimated to be worth\n$1.2 billion in 2024\nand projected to reach\n$4.8 billion by 2033\n,\ngrowing at a compound annual growth rate of 16.7% (Market Intelo, 2024) see\nGLP-1 Support Supplements Market Research Report 2033\n.\u00a0SlimBiome, with its four clinical studies, international awards, and 'on pack health claims' is well positioned to exploit this opportunity.\nStephen O'Hara, CEO of OptiBiotix Health plc said\n: \"\nWe are pleased to announce this large order from Meelung as well as record orders for the start of 2026. To have already secured orders totalling over \u00a3800k before the end of our first month of the year puts us in a strong position for the year ahead. These orders reflect the growing interest in bringing patented, branded ingredients, with human studies demonstrating hunger and appetite reduction to the fast growing 'natural alternative to GLP1' market.\nThe Company intends to provide a trading update for the financial year 2025 once figures have been finalised which will show another year of continued strong growth. With the start that we've had so far for 2026, the Company is in the strongest position it has been in with its first-generation products whilst having overcome a number of challenges with partners on large scale production (>100,000 mt) of our second-generation products as we move these along the pathway to launch.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was considered inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nEngage with the OptiBiotix management team directly by asking questions, watching video summaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say.\nView the full announcement and submit questions to management via our website:\nhttps://optibiotix.com/link/Pm5WaP\nSubscribe to the new website to get regular updates here:\nhttps://optibiotix.com/auth/signup\nFor further information, please contact: OptiBiotix Health plc\nwww.optibiotix.com\nNeil Davidson, Chairman\nStephen O'Hara, Chief Executive\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP (NOMAD and Broker)\nTel: 020 7213 0880\nLiam Murray / Jo Turner / Ludovico Lazzaretti\nAbout OptiBiotix\n-\nwww.optibiotix.com\nOptiBiotix Health plc (AIM: OPTI, OTCQB: OPTBF),\nOptiBiotix Health has developed a range of technologies and commercialised products which modulate the human microbiome to help prevent and manage human disease.\nSince the Group's inception it has created a wide range of microbiome-based ingredients and products including prebiotic products like\nSlimBiome\u00ae, WellBiome\u00ae, SweetBiotix\u00ae and Microbiome Modulators within its core OptiBiotix Health plc (OPTI) business, but also skincare through its holdings in SkinBioTherapeutics PLC (SBTX), and probiotics through ProBiotix Health plc (PBX).

They are produced using a patented technology developed by OptiBiotix which enzymatically modifies existing natural sweeteners like steviol glycosides and mogrosides and converts them into dietary fibres, providing sweetness with added nutritional and health benefits.\nIs SweetBiotix protected?\nSweetBiotix\u00ae are trademarked and patented products protected by a significant intellectual property portfolio comprising over 25 patents with a number of recent additional filings. Patents must demonstrate novelty/uniqueness, inventiveness (i.e. no one else has invented it), and industry applicability confirming the uniqueness of SweetBiotix. OptiBiotix patents cover synthesis, composition, and the application of SweetBiotix in food and beverages. They protect OptiBiotix's commercial interests, prevent competitors from entering the market, and create licensing opportunities with partners. SweetBiotix\u00ae is a registered trademark in international markets.\nThe\nSweetBiotix\n\u00ae Opportunity\nWidespread concern over the use of sugar in food and drinks has led to the development and use of sugar substitutes. These may be natural (e.g stevia, mogrosides, polyols) which often do not offer optimal taste profiles or artificial (e.g aspartame, sucralose, saccharin). Health concerns with artificial sugar substitutes have been widely reported and have been previously summarised (See RNS 30 January 2024). SweetBiotix are unique as a sugar substitute as they have been developed to overcome health concerns, are high in fibre, and have prebiotic functionality providing nutritional and health benefits not present in existing products. This a market estimated to be worth $29.9bn by 2029 (Markets and Markets: Oct 2024).\nWhat is the evidence that SweetBiotix\u00ae are sweet and have health benefits\nSweetBiotix\n\u00ae\nproducts\nhave been tested by academic groups who have published five papers in peer reviewed journals providing an independent assessment of SweetBiotix's\n\u00ae\ntaste and health benefits. One publication on an early SweetBiotix product\nconcluded\n'\nThis new ingredient could provide health benefits when evaluated in human studies by combining sweetness and prebiotic fiber functionality'.\n(see\nPrebiotic Potential of a New Sweetener Based on Galactooligosaccharides and Modified Mogrosides - PubMed (nih.gov)\n.\nThe Company has provided SweetBiotix samples under Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) to a number of partners, many of whom have specialist expertise in taste testing and sugar substitutes. This has led to a formal agreement with a USA partner and DSM Firmenich, a $12bn ingredients supplier, and several food and beverage companies supporting SweetBiotix development with a view to the use of SweetBiotix in their products. The combination of academic and i\nndustry validation with an industry leader specialist in the field committing manufacturing resources should give investors' confidence in these products.\nWhat has happened to the manufacture of these products?\nManufacturing scale up of SweetBiotix has been carried out by partners and shown flavour and texture comparable to laboratory scale\n. Scale up with Firmenich's contract manufacturer slowed during and after its merger with DSM and was subsequently transferred to DSM due to its inhouse manufacturing capability and the scale of the opportunity. The new team were unable to consistently reach high yields using the original enzyme extract. As part of its ongoing SweetBiotix partner development program, OptiBiotix screened over 50 enzymes and was able to identify\na new single enzyme (i.e. not an extract) which produced extremely high yields (~90%) of the same SweetBiotix. This simplifies the manufacturing process to produce a cleaner, more concentrated product with higher sweetness intensity and a significantly improved flavour profile. This enzyme works on both mogrosides and stevia glycosides allowing the\ngeneration of multiple SweetBiotix products of high purity, with the same enzyme, with a wide sweetness range compared to sucrose\n. This increases the number of product opportunities, and, from an industry viewpoint, reduces the need for multiple enzymes and manufacturing processes with a substantial reduction in production costs.\nOne other unique aspect of the new enzyme is that it produces SweetBiotix from sucrose (sugar). This reduces ingredient input costs and valorises an unhealthy, commoditised ingredient (sugar) with a rapidly reducing customer base into a healthy prebiotic fibre. This changes the positioning with sugar producers who have previously seen SweetBiotix\u00ae as a competitor, to a potential partner, by offering a unique, patented process which can utilise and modify commoditised sucrose into higher valued SweetBiotix products.\nImportantly, whilst there is a material change in the enzymatic process there is no change to the resulting SweetBiotix\u00ae product other than higher yields which significantly increases the purity (~90%) of the final product. The Company believes that most of the process changes are covered within its existing patent portfolio but has extended its filings on the enzyme use and composition given the uniqueness and commercial potential of their properties.\nNext Steps\nThe Company is producing quantities of SweetBiotix for its development, manufacturing, and application partners and sharing the new enzymatic process with DSM Firmenich, our US partner, and major sugar producers given its potential to valorise sugar.\nThe Company continues to receive an annual milestone of \u00a3100k from its US partner related to work on Mogrosides with total received to end of 2024 of \u00a3550k. Milestone payments are rarely seen in the food, beverage and supplement industry, even less so prior to commercial launch and should give investors' confidence in the value attributed to this technology by industry.\nSubject to any partner constraints, the Company hopes to be in a position to demonstrate a range of SweetBiotix products to investors in H1 2026.\nS\nte\np\nhe\nn O'H\na\nr\na\n,\nC\nEO\no\nf\nO\np\nt\ni\nB\ni\no\nt\ni\nx\n,\nc\no\nm\nme\nn\nte\nd\n:\n\"The Company has made a breakthrough in improving the manufacturing process of its SweetBiotix products. By using a new enzyme, rather than an enzyme extract, the Company is able to achieve substantially higher yields of a purer, more concentrated, better tasting product with lower ingredient and production costs\n. These are significant benefits when producing at large scale. This new enzyme works on both mogrosides and stevia glycosides allowing the\ngeneration of multiple SweetBiotix products using the same enzyme creating products with a wide sweetness range.\nThis increases the number of partnering and product opportunities and reduces the need for multiple enzymes and manufacturing processes with a substantial reduction in production costs. Whilst there have been the inevitable complexity and technical challenges in scaling up a new product with new partners these recent improvements have led us to a more efficient, cost-effective process, and an enhanced commercial proposition. The new enzyme not only improves yields but\nvalorises an unhealthy, commoditised ingredient (sugar) into higher value, healthy, SweetBiotix products.\nThe Company believes these improvements reflect a material change in the outlook for SweetBiotix products.\"\nThis announcement contains information which, prior to its disclosure, was considered inside information for the purposes of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nFor further information, please contact: OptiBiotix Health plc\nwww.optibiotix.com\nNeil Davidson, Chairman\nStephen O'Hara, Chief Executive\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP (NOMAD and Broker)\nTel: 020 7213 0880\nLiam Murray / Ludovico Lazzaretti / James Western\nAbout OptiBiotix\n-\nwww.optibiotix.com\nOptiBiotix Health plc (AIM: OPTI, OTCQB: OPTBF),\nOptiBiotix Health has developed a range of technologies and commercialised products which modulate the human microbiome to help prevent and manage human disease.\nSince the Group's inception it has created a wide range of microbiome-based ingredients and products including prebiotic products like\nSlimBiome\u00ae, WellBiome\u00ae, SweetBiotix\u00ae and Microbiome Modulators within its core OptiBiotix Health plc (OPTI) business, but also skincare through its holdings in SkinBioTherapeutics PLC (SBTX), and probiotics through ProBiotix Health plc (PBX).
