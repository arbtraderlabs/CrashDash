The Company will continue to make all announcements and disclosures to the London Stock Exchange as normal and is not subject to any Sarbanes-Oxley or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.\nThe Company believes that trading on the OTCQB will enable US based investors to purchase and hold shares of the Company, which they would otherwise be unable to hold in certain US brokerage accounts thereby adding to the liquidity of the stock. A further compelling reason for the OTC listing is the Company\u2019s recent announcement (\nAMOI:Trasna\n) in respect of the proposed $150 million acquisition of the Trasna Group of Companies.\nAbout Trasna:\nhttps://www.trasna.io/\nTrasna is a global technology leader specialising in semiconductor and mobile Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) solutions. With more than 600 employees and 200 clients worldwide, it combines expertise in semiconductors, secure data management, edge computing, AI, and blockchain to create innovative, end-to-end solutions - from chip design and SIM manufacturing to over-the-air subscription and device management.\nTrasna provides end-to-end cellular IoT solutions with a fully integrated hardware and software stack, providing complete IoT lifecycle management solutions. Trasna\u2019s aim is the simplification of mass IoT, focusing on security, efficiency, and innovation. Trasna has been hailed as one of the most complete, innovative, and fastest-to-deploy eSIM solution providers in the World.\nDuncan Soukup, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cWe are excited by the opportunities that access to US investors through OTC Markets offers. AMOI\u2019s RTO transaction with Trasna will be transformational for both companies, and the OTC Listing can be seen as Trasna\u2019s first step into the US capital markets. Trasna\u2019s current sales in the US are less than 10%, allowing for substantial future growth; with direct access to US investors now secured, Trasna can also look forward to potential interest from Wall Street analysts and US Investment Banks, which should help create a solid platform to support the Company\u2019s Global growth ambitions.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to extend my personal thanks to Jonathan Dickson and the entire OTC Markets Team for their professional support during the application and onboarding process. it has been a great pleasure working with you all. Thank you and we look forward to the future on OTC Markets confident in the knowledge that we are in good hands\u201d\nEND\nAnemoi International Ltd\nwww.anemoi-international.com\nEnquiries\nenquiries@anemoi-international.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement that contains inside information in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), transmitted by\nEQS Group\n.

Having said that sales conversion-times are slow, and the Board considers it imprudent to embark on geographic expansion until id4 has shown accelerated traction in its domestic market (Switzerland). On a positive note, current customers are expanding their commitment to id4 and the company currently has 19 offers in front of potential customers and 2 further offers agreed. With the FINMA rules in principal benefitting new technology providers and the healthy sale-pipeline with imminent completion of 50% of the offers, the Board would hope that H2 2022 should show significant operational and financial improvement.\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of 2022 revolve around the effects of the predicted recession and inflation noted above. It is felt that the id4 product is protected in many ways from recession due to the legal regulatory requirements that is met by the software, however the Board continue to engage in cost saving reviews to ensure that the going concern considerations of the Group remain long term.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2022 has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.\nThe interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2021 and any public announcements made by Anemoi International Ltd during the interim reporting period.\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na)\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of important events during the first six months and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year); and\nc)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R (disclosure of related parties' transactions and changes therein).\nCautionary statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to enable them to assess the Company\u2019s strategy and the potential for that strategy to succeed. The IMR should not be relied on by any other party or for any other purpose.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2022\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear Ended\nJun 2022\nJun 2021\nDec 2021\nGBP\nGBP\nGBP\nNote\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nContinuing Operations\nRevenue\n45,355\n-\n5,603\nCost of sales\n(24,070)\n-\n(3,525)\nGross profit\n21,285\n-\n2,078\nAdministrative expenses excluding exceptional costs\n(371,399)\n(115,014)\n(160,880)\nExceptional administration costs\n(58,166)\n-\n(445,796)\nTotal administrative expenses\n(429,565)\n(115,014)\n(606,676)\nOperating loss before depreciation\n(408,280)\n(115,014)\n(604,598)\nDepreciation and Amortisation\n4\n(42,131)\n-\n(3,874)\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\nOperating loss\n(450,411)\n(115,014)\n(608,472)\nNet financial income/(expense)\n3\n(384)\n(7,855)\n4,942\nProfit/(loss) before taxation\n(450,795)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nTaxation\n(685)\n-\n-\nProfit/(loss) for the period\n(451,480)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nEarnings per share - GBP pence (using weighted average number of shares)\nBasic and Diluted\n(0.29)\n(0.38)\n(1.55)\nBasic and Diluted\n6\n(0.29)\n(0.38)\n(1.55)\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2022\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear Ended\nJun 2022\nJun 2021\nDec 2021\nGBP\nGBP\nGBP\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nLoss for the financial year\n(451,480)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nOther comprehensive income:\nExchange differences on re-translating foreign operations\n197,530\n(13,563)\n(11,779)\nTotal comprehensive income\n(253,950)\n(13"
