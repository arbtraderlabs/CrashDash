The Company will continue to make all announcements and disclosures to the London Stock Exchange as normal and is not subject to any Sarbanes-Oxley or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.\nThe Company believes that trading on the OTCQB will enable US based investors to purchase and hold shares of the Company, which they would otherwise be unable to hold in certain US brokerage accounts thereby adding to the liquidity of the stock. A further compelling reason for the OTC listing is the Company\u2019s recent announcement (\nAMOI:Trasna\n) in respect of the proposed $150 million acquisition of the Trasna Group of Companies.\nAbout Trasna:\nhttps://www.trasna.io/\nTrasna is a global technology leader specialising in semiconductor and mobile Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) solutions. With more than 600 employees and 200 clients worldwide, it combines expertise in semiconductors, secure data management, edge computing, AI, and blockchain to create innovative, end-to-end solutions - from chip design and SIM manufacturing to over-the-air subscription and device management.\nTrasna provides end-to-end cellular IoT solutions with a fully integrated hardware and software stack, providing complete IoT lifecycle management solutions. Trasna\u2019s aim is the simplification of mass IoT, focusing on security, efficiency, and innovation. Trasna has been hailed as one of the most complete, innovative, and fastest-to-deploy eSIM solution providers in the World.\nDuncan Soukup, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cWe are excited by the opportunities that access to US investors through OTC Markets offers. AMOI\u2019s RTO transaction with Trasna will be transformational for both companies, and the OTC Listing can be seen as Trasna\u2019s first step into the US capital markets. Trasna\u2019s current sales in the US are less than 10%, allowing for substantial future growth; with direct access to US investors now secured, Trasna can also look forward to potential interest from Wall Street analysts and US Investment Banks, which should help create a solid platform to support the Company\u2019s Global growth ambitions.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to extend my personal thanks to Jonathan Dickson and the entire OTC Markets Team for their professional support during the application and onboarding process. it has been a great pleasure working with you all. Thank you and we look forward to the future on OTC Markets confident in the knowledge that we are in good hands\u201d\nEND\nAnemoi International Ltd\nwww.anemoi-international.com\nEnquiries\nenquiries@anemoi-international.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement that contains inside information in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), transmitted by\nEQS Group\n.

Having said that sales conversion-times are slow, and the Board considers it imprudent to embark on geographic expansion until id4 has shown accelerated traction in its domestic market (Switzerland). On a positive note, current customers are expanding their commitment to id4 and the company currently has 19 offers in front of potential customers and 2 further offers agreed. With the FINMA rules in principal benefitting new technology providers and the healthy sale-pipeline with imminent completion of 50% of the offers, the Board would hope that H2 2022 should show significant operational and financial improvement.\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of 2022 revolve around the effects of the predicted recession and inflation noted above. It is felt that the id4 product is protected in many ways from recession due to the legal regulatory requirements that is met by the software, however the Board continue to engage in cost saving reviews to ensure that the going concern considerations of the Group remain long term.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2022 has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.\nThe interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2021 and any public announcements made by Anemoi International Ltd during the interim reporting period.\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na)\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of important events during the first six months and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year); and\nc)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R (disclosure of related parties' transactions and changes therein).\nCautionary statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to enable them to assess the Company\u2019s strategy and the potential for that strategy to succeed. The IMR should not be relied on by any other party or for any other purpose.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2022\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear Ended\nJun 2022\nJun 2021\nDec 2021\nGBP\nGBP\nGBP\nNote\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nContinuing Operations\nRevenue\n45,355\n-\n5,603\nCost of sales\n(24,070)\n-\n(3,525)\nGross profit\n21,285\n-\n2,078\nAdministrative expenses excluding exceptional costs\n(371,399)\n(115,014)\n(160,880)\nExceptional administration costs\n(58,166)\n-\n(445,796)\nTotal administrative expenses\n(429,565)\n(115,014)\n(606,676)\nOperating loss before depreciation\n(408,280)\n(115,014)\n(604,598)\nDepreciation and Amortisation\n4\n(42,131)\n-\n(3,874)\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\nOperating loss\n(450,411)\n(115,014)\n(608,472)\nNet financial income/(expense)\n3\n(384)\n(7,855)\n4,942\nProfit/(loss) before taxation\n(450,795)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nTaxation\n(685)\n-\n-\nProfit/(loss) for the period\n(451,480)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nEarnings per share - GBP pence (using weighted average number of shares)\nBasic and Diluted\n(0.29)\n(0.38)\n(1.55)\nBasic and Diluted\n6\n(0.29)\n(0.38)\n(1.55)\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2022\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear Ended\nJun 2022\nJun 2021\nDec 2021\nGBP\nGBP\nGBP\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nLoss for the financial year\n(451,480)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nOther comprehensive income:\nExchange differences on re-translating foreign operations\n197,530\n(13,563)\n(11,779)\nTotal comprehensive income\n(253,950)\n(13"

The interim results have been submitted to the FCA and will shortly be available on the Company\u2019s website:\nwww.anemoi-international.com\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nW\nhat has happened in the KYC/AML market year to date 2025\nIn 2025, the KYC/AML market has seen significant developments driven by regulatory focus, technological advancements, and expanding enforcement. Key trends include:\nRegulatory Shifts and Enforcement:\nRegulators globally are emphasizing higher transparency, real-time monitoring, and risk-based frameworks to prioritize high-risk transactions and customers.\nEnhanced guidance from bodies like FATF stresses national risk assessments, beneficial ownership transparency, and stronger oversight of virtual assets and DeFi.\nEnforcement actions have surged, with banks facing over $3.5 billion in AML fines so far this year, and growing scrutiny on cryptocurrency exchanges, fintech, and gambling sectors.\nJurisdictions like the UK have implemented robust sanctions enforcement and mandatory disclosure reforms for overseas entities and trusts, increasing compliance demands.\nTechnology Adoption and Automation:\nAI, machine learning, and blockchain are increasingly integrated for identity verification, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity detection.\nOver 70% of KYC onboarding now utilizes automated biometric identification and digital verification, offering faster, data-driven compliance.\nRegTech solutions are projected to exceed a $22 billion market size in 2025, aiding financial institutions in sanction screening, enhanced due diligence, and regulatory reporting.\nMarket Dynamics and Challenges:\nThe need to modernize legacy systems and address synthetic identity fraud remains a challenge.\nFinancial institutions are expanding budgets for AML compliance but face uncertainties in meeting evolving regulatory expectations.\nThere is growing alignment across jurisdictions for beneficial ownership data sharing and cooperation to combat cross-border financial crime.\nOverall, 2025 is marked by a global pivot to smarter, technology-enabled KYC/AML compliance amid tougher regulatory scrutiny and increasing penalties for non-compliance.\nUnfortunately, id4 has so far failed to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the continued growth in the KYC/AML Market mentioned above, such that the Company is pivoting to an outsource sales strategy.\nIn parallel, the Board has also invited Richard Emanuel to the Board as Executive Chairman. Richard and I have already struck up a good working relationship, which I hope will result in positioning the Company for Growth. As previously announced, we have introduced a Crypto Treasury Management Strategy and already reaped positive returns from our holdings. Although I would point out that unlike many other companies that have gone down this road, our primary focus is to grow our core business and expand through acquisition, as possible.\nGiven the Company\u2019s results, I have again decided to waive my consultancy fee.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n26 September 2025\nFinancial Review\nDuring the period under review Book Value per share decreased from 2.25p as at 31 December 2024 to \u00a32.07p per share at 30 June 2025, driven by ongoing operating losses in ID4 AG, partially offset by investment returns of \u00a318k.\nThe Group Operating Loss before depreciation for the period increased from \u00a3(22)k in H1 2024 to \u00a3(185)k in H1 2025. 2024 results were positively impacted by the Chairman\u2019s Fee waiver for the proceeding reporting periods and in 2025 the Chairman again waived fees.\nThe Group Loss Before Tax for the period also increased from \u00a3(108)k in H1 2024 to \u00a3(279)k in H1 2025.\nTotal Income decreased from \u00a372k in H1 2024 to \u00a356k in H1 2025. The decline in Software services\u2019 income was partially offset by positive contribution from financial holdings and increased interest income.\nTotal Administrative Expenses increased from \u00a385k in H1 2024 to \u00a3218k in H1 2025. \u00a323k of other savings were identified in the current period vs the comparative period across other Administrative Expenses categories, including IT (accounting software savings), rent/office expenses and professional fees.\nDevelopment Costs capitalised to Intangible Assets were reduced from \u00a378k in H1 2024 to Nil in H1 2025 helping to preserve cash.\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na)\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of import",

A number of the risks to which the business is exposed, such as the condition of the UK and Swiss domestic economies in relation to asset management and investment in systems, are beyond the Company\u2019s influence. However, such risk areas are monitored and appropriate mitigating action, such as reviewing the substance and timing of the Company\u2019s operational plans, is taken wherever practicable in response to significant changes. The directors consider the risk areas the Company is exposed to in the light of prevailing economic conditions and the risk areas set out in this section are subject to review.\nIn relation to asset management, the Company\u2019s approach to risk reflects the Company\u2019s granular business model and position in the market and involves the expertise of its directors, management and third-party advisers. Operational progress and key investment and disposal decisions are considered in regular management team meetings as well as being subject to informal peer review.\nHigher level risks and financia",

The unaudited interim results have been submitted to the FCA and will shortly be available on the Company\u2019s website:\nwww.anemoi-international.com\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nUnaudited interim results for the six months to 30 June 2024.\nH1 2024 Revenues were disappointing and whilst we succeeded in cutting costs substantially, the Company still registered a loss for the period, albeit a substantially reduced loss compared to H1 2023.\nAs I have previously stated, I believe in the future of id4 but the Company is too small to sustain the costs of a public company. We have, therefore, explored a number of potential acquisitions, some in unrelated industries, in order to scale the business; upon closer inspection, none have yet fulfilled our acquisition criteria.\nWith regard to the future of id4, we are redoubling our efforts to increase revenues and are implementing an amended sales strategy to target intermediaries, such as resellers, consultants, system integrators and other service providers with broader and better client access, as well as continuing with our direct client sales efforts, which I am now directly supporting.\nCurrent sales pipeline is positive, and we are working hard to close some pending contracts, which have the potential for a material positive impact on H2 2024/H1 2025 results.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n26 September 2024\nFinancial Review\nDuring the period under review Book Value per share decreased by 5.0% from 2.60p as at 31 December 2023 to \u00a32.47p per share at 30 June 2024, driven by ongoing operating losses in ID4 AG, partially offset by investment returns of \u00a326k on listed securities and a decision by the Chairman to waive all of his consultancy fees which had been accrued from 2021 through H1 2024.\nThe Group Operating Loss for the period was reduced by 92% from \u00a3(288)k in H1 2023 to \u00a3(22)k in 1H 2024.\nThe Group Loss Before Tax for the period was also reduced by 69% from \u00a3(352)k in 1H 2023 to \u00a3(108)k in H1 2024.\nTotal Income declined 11.2% from \u00a382k in 1H 2023 to \u00a372k in H1 2024. The decline in Software services\u2019 income was partially offset by positive contribution from financial holdings and increased interest income.\nTotal Administrative Expenses declined 76% from \u00a3363k in 1H 2023 to \u00a385k in H1 2024, due to the waiving of the Chairman\u2019s consultancy fees in the current period (\u00a30.2m impact) and, in the comparative period, \u00a349k severance pay. \u00a335k of other savings were identified in the current period vs the comparative period across other Administrative Expenses categories, including IT (accounting software savings), rent/office expenses and Insurance.\nDevelopment Costs capitalised to Intangible Assets were reduced from \u00a3106k in H1 2023 to \u00a378k in H1 2024 helping to preserve cash, alongside stable Software Services Cost of Sales and stable Personnel costs (excluding impact of the consultancy fees waiver).\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na)\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of important events during the first six months and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year); and\nc)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R (disclosure of related parties' transactions and changes therein).\nCautionary statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to enable them to assess the Company\u2019s strategy and the potential for that strategy to succeed. The IMR should not be relied on by any other party or for any other purpose.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n26 September 2024\nInterim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2024\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear Ended\nJun 2024\nJun 2023\nDec 2023\nGBP\nGBP\nGBP\nNote\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nSoftware services income\n46,265\n79,563\n136,119\nNet gains/(losses) on investments at fair value\n7,597\n-\n-\nInvestment interest income\n18,504\n1,995\n11,351\nCurrency losses\n-\n(48)\n(29,444)\nTotal Income\n72,366\n81,510\n118,026\nSoftware services expenses\n(5,865)\n(5,869)\n(12,983)\nFinancial holdings expenses\n(3,113)\n(1,402)\n(2,643)\nTotal Cost of Sales\n(8,978)\n(7,271)\n(15,626)\nGross profit\n63,388\n74,239\n102,400\nAdministrative expenses excluding exceptional costs\n(85,467)\n(313,199)\n(622,654)\nExceptional administration costs\n-\n(49,441)\n(228,378)\nTotal a",

Accordingly, there will be a delay in publishing audited results for 2022 and, as a result, the Company is making an application pursuant to the Listing Rules for a conditional suspension of trading of the Company\u2019s shares.\nThe Company is exploring the possibility with RPG of a pre-release of unaudited accounts.

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nAnemoi is pleased to announce its unaudited interim results for the six months to 30 June 2022.\nThe first six months of 2022 were marked by changes to Swiss FINMA rules, which pushed out Institutional commitments to new technology, rampant inflation with the prospect of Central Bank over-tightening and the prospect of recession.\nDuring the period under review, id4 operated slightly above budgeted expectations for revenue and costs came in under budget. Having said that sales conversion-times are slow, and the Board considers it imprudent to embark on geographic expansion until id4 has shown accelerated traction in its domestic market (Switzerland). On a positive note, current customers are expanding their commitment to id4 and the company currently has 19 offers in front of potential customers and 2 further offers agreed. With the FINMA rules in principal benefitting new technology providers and the healthy sale-pipeline with imminent completion of 50% of the offers, the Board would hope that H2 2022 should show significant operational and financial improvement.\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of 2022 revolve around the effects of the predicted recession and inflation noted above. It is felt that the id4 product is protected in many ways from recession due to the legal regulatory requirements that is met by the software, however the Board continue to engage in cost saving reviews to ensure that the going concern considerations of the Group remain long term.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2022 has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.\nThe interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2021 and any public announcements made by Anemoi International Ltd during the interim reporting period.\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na)\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of important events during the first six months and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year); and\nc)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R (disclosure of related parties' transactions and changes therein).\nCautionary statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to enable them to assess the Company\u2019s strategy and the potential for that strategy to succeed.

TOO risen after acquisition around 50% Therefore it\u2019s hard to estimate what the SP will do. I\u2019m adding some more here after the RTO is done as that way I feel risk is lesser . However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

One thing that seems constant in so many cases on the UK markets is the conduct of market makers \u2013 something we don\u2019t see to the same extent in the US. I\u2019m genuinely frustrated with people making bold claims, only for the share price to drop straight after, suggesting those statements aren\u2019t entirely accurate. Any company that makes strong announcements and sees its share price rise tends to be the one telling the truth. Good luck to everyone affected. The 1.35\u20131.40 range only reinforces the idea that the recent statements aren\u2019t holding up \u2013 nobody is buying, which suggests confidence is lacking. The UK really needs to wake up.",

TOO risen after acquisition around 50% Therefore it\u2019s hard to estimate what the SP will do. I\u2019m adding some more here after the RTO is done as that way I feel risk is lesser . However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

TOO risen after acquisition around 50% Therefore it\u2019s hard to estimate what the SP will do. I\u2019m adding some more here after the RTO is done as that way I feel risk is lesser . However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

          "content": "Looking at a few RTO announcements recently .. MOS not a good one as has fallen 100% in a day looking at January, AMGO funding done and rose nearly 100% today. TOO risen after acquisition around 50% Therefore it\u2019s hard to estimate what the SP will do. I\u2019m adding some more here after the RTO is done as that way I feel risk is lesser . However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

The Company will continue to make all announcements and disclosures to the London Stock Exchange as normal and is not subject to any Sarbanes-Oxley or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.\nThe Company believes that trading on the OTCQB will enable US based investors to purchase and hold shares of the Company, which they would otherwise be unable to hold in certain US brokerage accounts thereby adding to the liquidity of the stock. A further compelling reason for the OTC listing is the Company\u2019s recent announcement (\nAMOI:Trasna\n) in respect of the proposed $150 million acquisition of the Trasna Group of Companies.\nAbout Trasna:\nhttps://www.trasna.io/\nTrasna is a global technology leader specialising in semiconductor and mobile Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) solutions. With more than 600 employees and 200 clients worldwide, it combines expertise in semiconductors, secure data management, edge computing, AI, and blockchain to create innovative, end-to-end solutions - from chip design and SIM manufacturing to over-the-air subscription and device management.\nTrasna provides end-to-end cellular IoT solutions with a fully integrated hardware and software stack, providing complete IoT lifecycle management solutions. Trasna\u2019s aim is the simplification of mass IoT, focusing on security, efficiency, and innovation. Trasna has been hailed as one of the most complete, innovative, and fastest-to-deploy eSIM solution providers in the World.\nDuncan Soukup, Chairman, commented:\n\u201cWe are excited by the opportunities that access to US investors through OTC Markets offers. AMOI\u2019s RTO transaction with Trasna will be transformational for both companies, and the OTC Listing can be seen as Trasna\u2019s first step into the US capital markets. Trasna\u2019s current sales in the US are less than 10%, allowing for substantial future growth; with direct access to US investors now secured, Trasna can also look forward to potential interest from Wall Street analysts and US Investment Banks, which should help create a solid platform to support the Company\u2019s Global growth ambitions.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to extend my personal thanks to Jonathan Dickson and the entire OTC Markets Team for their professional support during the application and onboarding process. it has been a great pleasure working with you all. Thank you and we look forward to the future on OTC Markets confident in the knowledge that we are in good hands\u201d\nEND\nAnemoi International Ltd\nwww.anemoi-international.com\nEnquiries\nenquiries@anemoi-international.com\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement that contains inside information in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), transmitted by\nEQS Group\n.

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

TOO risen after acquisition around 50% Therefore it\u2019s hard to estimate what the SP will do. I\u2019m adding some more here after the RTO is done as that way I feel risk is lesser . However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

TOO risen after acquisition around 50% Therefore it\u2019s hard to estimate what the SP will do. I\u2019m adding some more here after the RTO is done as that way I feel risk is lesser . However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",

Im holdingtill the end with a substantial amount of stock so all fingers crossed !....personally i think the deals done , singed and dusted but of course christmas has prob put us back a few days si just waiting for the  suspension, trying to top up as much as i can at this price !!",

Communication is key to keeping us up to date and creating further awareness.  There must be a timeline including EGM to pass the necessary resolutions.  Existing shareholders should be offered an opportunity to purchase further shares in the raise at 2p.  I've only purchased a small amount (61,500 shares) although also own 0.3% of THAL. It is definitely below the radar right now a bit like NWT another one of THAL's investments.  Hopefully all will come good :)",

However the RTO SP is 2p so that should be a reasonable base price .. XMAS market is not the best time for this to happen but the New Year should be a lot brighter AMOI currently not a profitable concern and seemed to stop the Bitcoin treasury after one decent transaction so to RTO into a decent company that actually makes money makes a lot more sense than sitting around continuing there current strategy Merry XMAS all and yes think New Year new change will be most welcome and aware there may be a big rollercoaster ride ahead too",
