Having said that sales conversion-times are slow, and the Board considers it imprudent to embark on geographic expansion until id4 has shown accelerated traction in its domestic market (Switzerland). On a positive note, current customers are expanding their commitment to id4 and the company currently has 19 offers in front of potential customers and 2 further offers agreed. With the FINMA rules in principal benefitting new technology providers and the healthy sale-pipeline with imminent completion of 50% of the offers, the Board would hope that H2 2022 should show significant operational and financial improvement.\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of 2022 revolve around the effects of the predicted recession and inflation noted above. It is felt that the id4 product is protected in many ways from recession due to the legal regulatory requirements that is met by the software, however the Board continue to engage in cost saving reviews to ensure that the going concern considerations of the Group remain long term.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2022 has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.\nThe interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2021 and any public announcements made by Anemoi International Ltd during the interim reporting period.\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na)\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of important events during the first six months and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year); and\nc)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R (disclosure of related parties' transactions and changes therein).\nCautionary statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to enable them to assess the Company\u2019s strategy and the potential for that strategy to succeed.

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nAnemoi is pleased to announce its unaudited interim results for the six months to 30 June 2022.\nThe first six months of 2022 were marked by changes to Swiss FINMA rules, which pushed out Institutional commitments to new technology, rampant inflation with the prospect of Central Bank over-tightening and the prospect of recession.\nDuring the period under review, id4 operated slightly above budgeted expectations for revenue and costs came in under budget. Having said that sales conversion-times are slow, and the Board considers it imprudent to embark on geographic expansion until id4 has shown accelerated traction in its domestic market (Switzerland). On a positive note, current customers are expanding their commitment to id4 and the company currently has 19 offers in front of potential customers and 2 further offers agreed. With the FINMA rules in principal benefitting new technology providers and the healthy sale-pipeline with imminent completion of 50% of the offers, the Board would hope that H2 2022 should show significant operational and financial improvement.\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of 2022 revolve around the effects of the predicted recession and inflation noted above. It is felt that the id4 product is protected in many ways from recession due to the legal regulatory requirements that is met by the software, however the Board continue to engage in cost saving reviews to ensure that the going concern considerations of the Group remain long term.\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2022 has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.\nThe interim report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2021 and any public announcements made by Anemoi International Ltd during the interim reporting period.\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\na)\nthe condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting';\nb)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R (indication of important events during the first six months and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year); and\nc)\nthe interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R (disclosure of related parties' transactions and changes therein).\nCautionary statement\nThis Interim Management Report (IMR) has been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to enable them to assess the Company\u2019s strategy and the potential for that strategy to succeed. The IMR should not be relied on by any other party or for any other purpose.\nDuncan Soukup\nChairman\nAnemoi International Ltd\n10 August 2022\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2022\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear Ended\nJun 2022\nJun 2021\nDec 2021\nGBP\nGBP\nGBP\nNote\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nContinuing Operations\nRevenue\n45,355\n-\n5,603\nCost of sales\n(24,070)\n-\n(3,525)\nGross profit\n21,285\n-\n2,078\nAdministrative expenses excluding exceptional costs\n(371,399)\n(115,014)\n(160,880)\nExceptional administration costs\n(58,166)\n-\n(445,796)\nTotal administrative expenses\n(429,565)\n(115,014)\n(606,676)\nOperating loss before depreciation\n(408,280)\n(115,014)\n(604,598)\nDepreciation and Amortisation\n4\n(42,131)\n-\n(3,874)\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\nOperating loss\n(450,411)\n(115,014)\n(608,472)\nNet financial income/(expense)\n3\n(384)\n(7,855)\n4,942\nProfit/(loss) before taxation\n(450,795)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nTaxation\n(685)\n-\n-\nProfit/(loss) for the period\n(451,480)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nEarnings per share - GBP pence (using weighted average number of shares)\nBasic and Diluted\n(0.29)\n(0.38)\n(1.55)\nBasic and Diluted\n6\n(0.29)\n(0.38)\n(1.55)\nUnaudited Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2022\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear Ended\nJun 2022\nJun 2021\nDec 2021\nGBP\nGBP\nGBP\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nLoss for the financial year\n(451,480)\n(122,869)\n(603,530)\nOther comprehensive income:\nExchange differences on re-translating foreign operations\n197,530\n(13,563)\n(11,779)\nTotal comprehensive income\n(253,950)\n(13"
