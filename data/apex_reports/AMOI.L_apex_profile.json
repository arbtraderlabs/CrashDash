With more than 600 employees and 200 clients worldwide, it combines expertise in semiconductors, secure data management, edge computing, AI, and blockchain to create innovative, end-to-end solutions - from chip design and SIM manufacturing to over-the-air subscription and device management.\nTrasna provides end-to-end cellular IoT solutions with a fully integrated hardware and software stack, providing complete IoT lifecycle management solutions. Trasna\u2019s aim is the simplification of mass IoT, focusing on security, efficiency, and innovation. Trasna has been hailed as one of the most complete, innovative, and fastest-to-deploy eSIM solution providers in the World.\nRationale for the Proposed Transaction\nThe Directors of Anemoi consider the Proposed Transaction to be a transformational, value enhancing transaction for all Company stakeholders, and one which is fully aligned with the Company's stated strategy to identify an RTO target of size and demonstrable growth potential.\nFurther Details\nThe Proposed Transaction remains subject to various conditions, including full due diligence and a fundraise at the time of the RTO and Readmission (defined below). Due to the size of the Proposed Transaction relative to the Company's market capitalisation, the Proposed Transaction will be classified as a reverse takeover. The Company will be seeking readmission and trading of its shares to the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) category on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (\u201cReadmission\u201d) and will, in due course, publish a prospectus.\nShareholders should be aware that there is a possibility that the Proposed Transaction will not proceed or that the terms may change depending upon the outcome of due diligence.\nThe Company will provide further updates on the Proposed Transaction in due course.\nDuncan Soukup, Chairman of Anemoi\n, commented:\n\" I am delighted that we have secured such an exciting business prospect for our Shareholders who I would like to thank, along with the AMOI Board, for your patience during the search process. Thank you all for your support on this stage of a journey which in reality is only just beginning.\"\n\u201cMy thanks also to Stephane for engaging with us. Whilst I have only known Stephane a few months, he strikes me as man on a mission, someone who shares my own \u201ccan do\u201d attitude to life and business.\u201d\n\u201cIn the coming days we will announce the advisory team that we will appoint to implement and execute the transaction.\u201d\nSt\u00e9phane Fund, Founder and CEO of Trasna,\ncommented:\n\u201cThe proposed RTO into Anemoi represents a significant and transformational milestone for Trasna. I believe that Trasna offers a compelling strategic platform with an established international footprint and continued strong growth prospects. The Proposed Transaction, and readmission to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, offers the Company access to public capital which in turn will allow us to accelerate the company\u2019s growth whilst simultaneously enhancing the Group\u2019s financial strength, scale and position in the Global Semi-Conductor Industry.\u201d\nEND\nAnemoi International Ltd\nwww.anemoi-international.com\nenquiries@anemoi-international.com\nTrasna Solutions Technologies Limited\nwww.trasna.io\nmedia@trasna.io\nDissemination of a Regulatory Announcement that contains inside information in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), transmitted by\nEQS Group\n.
