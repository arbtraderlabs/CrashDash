The Company has issued six unsecured convertible loan notes (\"CLN\") of \u00a3250,000 each to Surich Real Estate Opportunity Fund SPC (\"Surich Real Estate\" or the \"Noteholder\"). The Company received the funds on 25 November 2025.\nThe loan notes are convertible in new ordinary shares at a price of \u00a38.00 per share and carry a coupon of 6% per annum. The loan notes have an initial term of three years.\nSurich Real Estate is wholly owned and controlled by Mr Ziwei Peng. Mr Peng is the owner and controller of Golden Nice International Group Limited, which holds a 24.55% interest in the issued share capital of the Company. Given Mr Peng's holding in the Company, the issue of the CLNs to Surich Real Estate constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 7.3 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe Company is issuing the CLNs to provide funding for its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to support the implementation of its strategy, as described in its prospectus dated 31 October 2023, to pursue one or more additional acquisitions of businesses (whether by way of share or asset purchases) in the beverage distribution and production sector in the UK and across Europe.\nThe\u00a0material\u00a0terms\u00a0of the\u00a0Loan\u00a0Note\u00a0Instrument are as set out in the Company's announcement dated\u00a016 August 2024. Defined terms in this announcement shall have the same meaning as set out in the Company's announcement dated\u00a016 August 2024.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014 (which forms part of domestic UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018).\nThe directors of the Company accept responsibility for the content of this announcement.\nFor further information please contact:\nEverest Global plc\nAndy Sui, Chief Executive Officer\nRob Scott, Non-Executive Director\n+44 (0) 776 775 1787\n+27 (0)84\u00a06006 001\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\nAndrew Emmott\n+44 (0) 20 3368 3555\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The completion of the Capital Re-Organisation provides the Company with a simplified capital structure and enhanced flexibility for future corporate developments, and the Board would like to thank shareholders for their strong support for these proposals.\nAs part of the Capital Re-Organisation completion process, the Company has also corrected a historical omission relating to 12,500,000 consideration shares that were issued in March 2024 in connection with the acquisition of Precious Link (UK) Limited, as announced on 18 December 2023, which should have been admitted to trading on completion of the acquisition. Accordingly, the resulting New Ordinary Shares are included within the shares admitted today.\nFollowing completion of the Capital Re-Organisation, the total number of New Ordinary Shares in issue is 386,945. The Company does not hold any shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is 386,945. This figure (386,945) may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. Trading in the New Ordinary Shares commenced on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange at 8:00 a.m. today.\nThe new ISIN for the New Ordinary Shares is GB00BVD9DK18. The Company's ticker, EVST, is unchanged.\nFor further information please contact the following:\nEverest Global plc\nAndy Sui, Chief Executive Officer\nRob Scott, Non-Executive Director\n+44 (0) 776 775 1787\n+27 (0)84\u00a06006 001\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\nAndrew Emmott\n+44 (0) 20 3368 3555\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Not for release, publication or distribution in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws or regulations of such jurisdiction.\n10 October 2025\nEverest Global plc\n(\"Everest\" or the \"Company\")\nPublication of Circular & Notice of General Meeting\nEverest Global plc (LSE: EVST) today announces that it proposes to undertake a subdivision and consolidation of the Company's share capital (the \"\nCapital Reorganisation\n\") and to convene a General Meeting of shareholders to approve the necessary resolutions and adoption of new articles of association (together, the \"\nProposals\n\").\nA circular containing full details of the Capital Reorganisation and a notice convening the General Meeting (the \"\nCircular\n\") will be posted to shareholders today and made available on the Company's website at\nhttps://everestglobalplc.com/investors/\n.\nThe Circular and this announcement set out the background to, and reasons for, the Proposals.\nBackground and Reasons for Seeking Approval for the Resolutions\nThe Company currently has a large number of ordinary shares in issue, with a relatively low nominal value per share. The Board believes that this structure is no longer optimal for the Company or its shareholders. In particular, the high number of shares in issue, when compared with the Company's market capitalisation, results in a share price that is lower than that of many companies of a similar size listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nIn addition, under the Companies Act 2006, new shares cannot be issued at a price below their nominal value. As the Company's nominal value per share is currently higher than its market price, this restricts the Company's ability to raise capital or otherwise issue shares in the future. The proposed consolidation will reduce the number of shares in issue and increase the nominal value per share, thereby ensuring that the nominal value is set below the prevailing market price of the shares and restoring flexibility for the Company to issue new equity if required.\nThe Board considers that the proposed consolidation of the Company's ordinary shares will:\n\u00b7\nresult in a more appropriate number of shares in issue relative to the Company's size and market capitalisation;\n\u00b7\ncreate a share price level that the Board believes will be more attractive to a wider range of retail investors, institutional investors and other market participants;\n\u00b7\nreduce share price volatility that can sometimes be associated with a very low nominal share price; and\n\u00b7\nensure that the nominal value of the shares is below the current market price, thereby enabling the Company to issue new shares in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe proposed consolidation will not in itself affect the underlying market capitalisation of the Company or the proportionate interests of shareholders in the Company. Other than any minor impact arising from the treatment of fractional entitlements, each shareholder will hold the same proportion of the Company's issued share capital immediately before and after the consolidation.\nAccordingly, the Board considers the proposed share consolidation to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and is therefore seeking shareholder approval for the necessary resolution.\nBefore the General Meeting\nIn the usual way we ask and encourage Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions. Shareholders are encouraged to complete the enclosed Form of Proxy and return it to the Registrar, Neville Registrars Limited at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen B62 8HD as soon as possible but in any event to be received not later than 10:00 a.m. on 5 November 2025 or 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before any adjourned meeting.\nCapital Reorganisation\nThe Company currently has 77,388,855 ordinary shares of \u00a30.02 each in issue (\"\nExisting Ordinary Shares\n\"). To facilitate the Share Reorganisation, the Company will need to issue 145 additional shares on or before the Record Date to ensure the issued share capital is exactly divisible by the consolidation ratio (200). The Board proposes to carry out a subdivision and reclassification of the Existing and to be issued Ordinary Shares by 200:1 so that each Existing Ordinary Share will be subdivided and reclassified into one (1) new ordinary share of \u00a30.000005 each (\"\nNew Ordinary Share\n\") and (2) 3,999 deferred shares of \u00a30.000005 each (\"\nDeferred Shares\n\") (\"\nSubdivision\n\"), followed by a consolidation of the New Ordinary Shares and Deferred Shares by 200 so that every 200 New Ordinary Shares and every 200 Deferred Shares will be consolidated into one New Ordinary Share and one Deferred Share of \u00a30.001 each (\"\nConsolidation\n\", together with the Subdivision, \"\nCapital Reorganisation\n\"). The Deferred Shares will have no right to vote or participate in the capital of the Company and the Company will not issue any certificates or credit CREST accounts in respect of them. The Deferred Shares will not be admitted to trading on any exchange. The rights of the ordinary shares and the Deferred Shares will be set out in the new articles of association proposed to be adopted by the Company. The purpose of the Capital Reorganisation is to reduce the nominal value of the Existing Ordinary Shares and to reduce the number of shares in issue.\nFor purely illustrative purposes, examples of the effects of the proposed Capital Reorganisation (should it be approved by Shareholders) are set out below:\nNumber of Existing Ordinary Shares\nof \u00a30.02 each\nheld\nNumber of New Ordinary Shares\nof \u00a30.001 each\nfollowing the Capital Reorganisation\nNumber of Deferred Shares\nof \u00a30.001 each\nfollowing the Capital Reorganisation\n200\n1\n3,999\n10,000\n50\n199,950\n1,000,000\n5,000\n19,995,000\n20,000,000\n100,000\n399,900,000\nIt is likely that the Capital Reorganisation will result in fractional entitlements to a New Ordinary Share where any holding is not precisely divisible by 200. No certificates will be issued for fractional entitlements to New Ordinary Shares. Following the implementation of the Capital Reorganisation, certain shareholders may not have a proportionate shareholding of New Ordinary Shares exactly equal to their proportionate holding of Existing Ordinary Shares. Furthermore, any shareholders holding fewer than 200 Existing Ordinary Shares as at 6:00 p.m. on 7 November 2025 (the \"\nRecord Date\n\") will cease to be a shareholder of the ordinary shares in the Company. The minimum threshold to receive New Ordinary Shares will be 200 Existing Ordinary Shares.\nThe Articles permit the Directors to sell shares representing fractional entitlements arising from the proposed capital reorganisation. Any New Ordinary Shares in respect of which there are fractional entitlements will therefore be aggregated and sold in the market for the best price reasonably obtainable on behalf of shareholders entitled to fractions. The Company will distribute the proceeds of sale in due proportion to any such shareholders in accordance with the Articles.\nShare certificates in respect of the New Ordinary Shares, will be issued following the Capital Reorganisation or, in the case of uncertificated holders, Euroclear UK and International Limited will be instructed to credit the CREST participant's account with New Ordinary Shares.\nThe New Articles\nThe Company's current memorandum and articles of association were adopted by the Company on 24 April 2015 and amended by special resolution on 24 April 2017 (the \"\nCurrent Articles\n\"). Due to the proposed Capital Reorganisation the Company needs to adopt a revised memorandum and articles of association to establish the Deferred Shares, and set out the rights attaching thereto. Below is a summary of the material differences between the Current Articles and the proposed New Articles:\nThe New Ordinary Shares will have the same rights as the Existing Ordinary Shares including voting, dividend, return of capital and other rights. The Deferred Shares will have no dividend or voting rights and, upon a return of capital, the right only to receive the amount paid up thereon after the holders of the Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company have received the aggregate amount paid up thereon. The Deferred Shares will not be traded on the Main Market or any other market, and no share certificates will be issued in respect of the Deferred Shares, nor will the CREST accounts of holders of New Ordinary Shares be credited with any Deferred Shares.\nThe Company will be able to hold general meetings and annual general meetings by means of electronic facility or facilities. The notice of the meetings will specify whether the meeting will be a physical, electronic or hybrid meeting. In the case of an electronic or hybrid meeting, the notice shall specify the date, time and electronic platform for the meeting, which electronic platform may vary from time to time and from meeting to meeting as the Board, in its sole discretion, sees fit. At any electronic general meeting, the Board may impose any necessary requirements or restrictions to verify the identity of those taking part and the security of the electronic communications. The Company will also be able to authorise any voting application, system or facility for electronic or satellite general meetings as it sees fit. For the avoidance of doubt, the New Articles will not prevent a general meeting being held both physically and electronically.\nSubject to express agreement by members (as further detailed in the proposed New Articles), the Company will be able to send any documents or notices to members, who have provided their express consent, in electronic form and use its website to display certain documents rather than sending these documents to members in hardcopy form.\nAdmission of the New Ordinary Shares\nApplication will be made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in place of the Existing Ordinary Shares. It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares will commence on 10 November 2025.\nShareholders who hold Existing Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form will have such shares disabled in their CREST accounts on the Record Date, and their CREST accounts will be credited with the New Ordinary Shares following Admission, which is expected to take place on 10 November 2025.\nFollowing the Capital Reorganisation, share certificates in respect of Existing Ordinary Shares will cease to be valid. Share certificates in respect of holding of New Ordinary Shares will be sent to the registered address of shareholders on the register at 6:00 p.m. on the record date. The share certificates will be despatched by 1st class post, at the risk of the shareholder.\nResolutions at the General Meeting\nResolution 1 - Share Capital Reclassification\nSubject to the New Articles being adopted, this is an ordinary resolution to grant the Directors with authority to subdivide and reclassify the existing ordinary shares of \u00a30.02 each in the capital of the Company so that each ordinary share of \u00a30.02 are sub-divided and reclassified into one (1) New Ordinary Share of \u00a30.000005 each in the capital of the Company and (2) 3,999 new Deferred Shares of \u00a30.000005 each in the capital of the Company with each having the rights and restrictions set out in the New Articles.\nResolution 2 - Consolidation of Shares\nSubject to the New Articles being adopted and the share capital reclassification described at Resolution 1 being passed, this is an ordinary resolution to grant the Directors with authority to consolidate the New Ordinary Shares and Deferred Shares so that every 200 New Ordinary Shares and every 200 Deferred Shares will be consolidated into one New Ordinary Share and one Deferred Share of \u00a30.001 each in the capital of the Company with each having the rights and restrictions set out in the New Articles.\nResolution 3 - Adoption of New Articles\nThis is a special resolution to approve the adoption of the New Articles.\nA copy of the Company's Current Articles and the proposed New Articles of association will be available for inspection during normal business hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays) at the offices of Hill Dickinson LLP, The Broadgate Tower, 20 Primrose Street, London EC2A 2EW from the date of this Document until the close of the General Meeting. The proposed New Articles will also be available for inspection at the General Meeting at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the meeting and up until the close of the meeting.\nResolution 4 - Notice\nThis is a special resolution to approve the reduction of the notice period to call a general meeting to 14 days.\nAction to be taken by Shareholders\nShareholders will find enclosed with this letter a Form of Proxy for use at the General Meeting. The Form of Proxy should be completed and returned in accordance with the instructions printed on it so as to arrive to the Registrar, Neville Registrars Limited at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen B62 8HD as possible and in any event not later than 10:00 a.m. on 5 November 2025. Completion and the return of the Form of Proxy will not prevent Shareholders from attending and voting at the General Meeting should they so wish.\nRecommendation\nThe Directors unanimously believe that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders and unanimously recommend you vote in favour of the Resolutions.\nEXPECTED TIMETABLE OF PRINCIPAL EVENTS\nEvent\nExpected time / date\nPublication and posting of this Document and Form of Proxy\n10 October 2025\nLatest time and date for receipt of Form of Proxy\n10:00 a.m. on 5 November 2025\nTime and Date of General Meeting\n10:00 a.m. on 7 November 2025\nAnnouncement of results of General Meeting\n7 November 2025\nRecord date for Capital Reorganisation\n6:00 p.m. on 7 November 2025\nLatest time and date for dealing in Existing Ordinary Shares\n6:00 p.m. on 7 November 2025\nExpected date of admission of New Ordinary Shares to the Main Market\n10 November 2025\nExpected date CREST accounts are to be credited with New Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form\n10 November 2025\nDespatch of definitive certificate for New Ordinary Shares (in certificated form)\nwithin 10 Business Days of admission\nCopies of the Circular and the Notice of General Meeting will be available on the Company's website at:\nhttps://everestglobalplc.com/investors/\nFor further information please contact the following:\nEverest Global plc\nAndy Sui, Chief Executive Officer\nRob Scott, Non-Executive Director\n+44 (0) 776 775 1787\n+27 (0)84\u00a06006 001\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\nAndrew Emmott\n+44 (0) 20 3368 3555\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company has issued six unsecured convertible loan notes (\"CLN\") of \u00a3250,000 each to Surich Real Estate Opportunity Fund SPC (\"Surich Real Estate\" or the \"Noteholder\"). The Company received the funds on 25 November 2025.\nThe loan notes are convertible in new ordinary shares at a price of \u00a38.00 per share and carry a coupon of 6% per annum. The loan notes have an initial term of three years.\nSurich Real Estate is wholly owned and controlled by Mr Ziwei Peng. Mr Peng is the owner and controller of Golden Nice International Group Limited, which holds a 24.55% interest in the issued share capital of the Company. Given Mr Peng's holding in the Company, the issue of the CLNs to Surich Real Estate constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 7.3 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe Company is issuing the CLNs to provide funding for its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to support the implementation of its strategy, as described in its prospectus dated 31 October 2023, to pursue one or more additional acquisitions of businesses (whether by way of share or asset purchases) in the beverage distribution and production sector in the UK and across Europe.\nThe\u00a0material\u00a0terms\u00a0of the\u00a0Loan\u00a0Note\u00a0Instrument are as set out in the Company's announcement dated\u00a016 August 2024.

The completion of the Capital Re-Organisation provides the Company with a simplified capital structure and enhanced flexibility for future corporate developments, and the Board would like to thank shareholders for their strong support for these proposals.\nAs part of the Capital Re-Organisation completion process, the Company has also corrected a historical omission relating to 12,500,000 consideration shares that were issued in March 2024 in connection with the acquisition of Precious Link (UK) Limited, as announced on 18 December 2023, which should have been admitted to trading on completion of the acquisition. Accordingly, the resulting New Ordinary Shares are included within the shares admitted today.\nFollowing completion of the Capital Re-Organisation, the total number of New Ordinary Shares in issue is 386,945. The Company does not hold any shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is 386,945. This figure (386,945) may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. Trading in the New Ordinary Shares commenced on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange at 8:00 a.m. today.\nThe new ISIN for the New Ordinary Shares is GB00BVD9DK18.

Not for release, publication or distribution in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws or regulations of such jurisdiction.\n10 October 2025\nEverest Global plc\n(\"Everest\" or the \"Company\")\nPublication of Circular & Notice of General Meeting\nEverest Global plc (LSE: EVST) today announces that it proposes to undertake a subdivision and consolidation of the Company's share capital (the \"\nCapital Reorganisation\n\") and to convene a General Meeting of shareholders to approve the necessary resolutions and adoption of new articles of association (together, the \"\nProposals\n\").\nA circular containing full details of the Capital Reorganisation and a notice convening the General Meeting (the \"\nCircular\n\") will be posted to shareholders today and made available on the Company's website at\nhttps://everestglobalplc.com/investors/\n.\nThe Circular and this announcement set out the background to, and reasons for, the Proposals.\nBackground and Reasons for Seeking Approval for the Resolutions\nThe Company currently has a large number of ordinary shares in issue, with a relatively low nominal value per share. The Board believes that this structure is no longer optimal for the Company or its shareholders. In particular, the high number of shares in issue, when compared with the Company's market capitalisation, results in a share price that is lower than that of many companies of a similar size listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nIn addition, under the Companies Act 2006, new shares cannot be issued at a price below their nominal value. As the Company's nominal value per share is currently higher than its market price, this restricts the Company's ability to raise capital or otherwise issue shares in the future. The proposed consolidation will reduce the number of shares in issue and increase the nominal value per share, thereby ensuring that the nominal value is set below the prevailing market price of the shares and restoring flexibility for the Company to issue new equity if required.\nThe Board considers that the proposed consolidation of the Company's ordinary shares will:\n\u00b7\nresult in a more appropriate number of shares in issue relative to the Company's size and market capitalisation;\n\u00b7\ncreate a share price level that the Board believes will be more attractive to a wider range of retail investors, institutional investors and other market participants;\n\u00b7\nreduce share price volatility that can sometimes be associated with a very low nominal share price; and\n\u00b7\nensure that the nominal value of the shares is below the current market price, thereby enabling the Company to issue new shares in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe proposed consolidation will not in itself affect the underlying market capitalisation of the Company or the proportionate interests of shareholders in the Company. Other than any minor impact arising from the treatment of fractional entitlements, each shareholder will hold the same proportion of the Company's issued share capital immediately before and after the consolidation.\nAccordingly, the Board considers the proposed share consolidation to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and is therefore seeking shareholder approval for the necessary resolution.\nBefore the General Meeting\nIn the usual way we ask and encourage Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions. Shareholders are encouraged to complete the enclosed Form of Proxy and return it to the Registrar, Neville Registrars Limited at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen B62 8HD as soon as possible but in any event to be received not later than 10:00 a.m. on 5 November 2025 or 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before any adjourned meeting.\nCapital Reorganisation\nThe Company currently has 77,388,855 ordinary shares of \u00a30.02 each in issue (\"\nExisting Ordinary Shares\n\"). To facilitate the Share Reorganisation, the Company will need to issue 145 additional shares on or before the Record Date to ensure the issued share capital is exactly divisible by the consolidation ratio (200). The Board proposes to carry out a subdivision and reclassification of the Existing and to be issued Ordinary Shares by 200:1 so that each Existing Ordinary Share will be subdivided and reclassified into one (1) new ordinary share of \u00a30.000005 each (\"\nNew Ordinary Share\n\") and (2) 3,999 deferred shares of \u00a30.000005 each (\"\nDeferred Shares\n\") (\"\nSubdivision\n\"), followed by a consolidation of the New Ordinary Shares and Deferred Shares by 200 so that every 200 New Ordinary Shares and every 200 Deferred Shares will be consolidated into one New Ordinary Share and one Deferred Share of \u00a30.001 each (\"\nConsolidation\n\", together with the Subdivision, \"\nCap",

The business will start trading under the new banner in\nSeptember 2025\n. The Directors believe acquiring a cigar distributor and cigar lounge is a highly complementary strategic move for its existing alcohol distribution and retail business due to the powerful synergy between premium spirits and fine cigars. Everest's existing alcohol distribution business will benefit from a new outlet for its products in the cigar lounge. This new venture creates an immediate additional direct-to-consumer retail channel, with a flagship showcase for the distributor's own portfolio of products. It allows the Company to curate specific brand experiences, educate consumers and build significant brand loyalty in a controlled, upscale environment. This not only opens up a new, high-margin revenue stream from direct sales but also serves as an invaluable marketing and market research tool, providing direct feedback on consumer preferences that can inform the broader distribution strategy.\nThe Directors of the Company take responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nFor further information please contact the following:\nEverest Global plc\nAndy Sui, Chief Executive Officer\nRob Scott, Non-Executive Director\n+44 (0) 776 775 1787\n+27 (0)84\n6006 001\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited\nAndrew Emmot\n+44 (0) 20 3368 3555",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS\u00a0INSIDE\u00a0INFORMATION\u00a0IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n25\nJuly 2025\nEverest Global plc\n(\"\nEverest\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nUnaudited interim results for the six months ended 30 April 2025\nThe Board of Everest is pleased to announce its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 April 2025.\nChief Executive Officer's report\nThe unaudited interim results for the six-month period ended 30 April 2025 have been pleasing. The company is growing its presence in the London alcohol retail market and is considering growing its footprint further in this sector, with the addition of new retail stores. This period has seen significant transformation and growth, marked by a substantial increase in revenue, a return to profitability, and the successful expansion of our retail footprint.\nThe first half of the 2025 fiscal year has been a period of achievement for Everest Global plc. The Board is delighted to report a turnaround in the Group's financial performance, transitioning from a loss in the previous comparable period to a profit. This success is a direct result of the strategic initiatives executed, including the full integration and revenue contribution of our existing alcohol retail shops and the outstanding performance of our new London store, which commenced operations in January 2025.\nRevenue for the six-month period surged by approximately 100% to \u00a3270,251, a clear indicator of our growth and the successful execution of our expansion strategy. Gross profit margins have shown a healthy improvement, reflecting better supplier terms and a favourable product mix. Administration expenses saw a controlled increase to \u00a3312,929 from \u00a3291,346, an increase that is well below the rate of revenue growth. This reflects prudent cost management and the operational leverage of our business model. This top-line growth, combined with disciplined cost management and improved operational efficiencies, has enabled the Group to report a profit before one-off items of \u00a375,617, a stark and welcome contrast to the loss of \u00a3285,307 in the corresponding prior period.\nFinance costs have been impacted by the interest on convertible loan notes relative to the comparable prior period, as previously disclosed. However, as described in the full year accounts, the Board implemented a treasury strategy to actively managed our cash reserves to generate higher finance income through investing in short-term secured loans, offsetting these costs. These investments have been fully repaid. The Group is reviewing its treasury management strategy, but for the time being does not expect to invest surplus capital in short-term loans.\nThe Group maintains a healthy cash and near-cash position and a strengthened balance sheet. The positive cash flow from operations during this period underscores the sustainability of our business model.\nThe new store, which opened its doors in January 2025, has exceeded initial expectations. Its performance has been a key driver of our revenue growth and has contributed positively to our overall profitability from its first full quarter of operation. This successful launch provides a replicable blueprint for future expansion. We are closely monitoring key performance indicators such as like-for-like sales growth, gross margin percentage, and inventory turnover, all of which are trending in a positive direction.\nOur strategic focus remains on expanding our presence in the food and beverage distribution sector and where strategic manufacturing. The early success of our latest store opening validates our business model and provides a strong platform for future growth. We are committed to building on this momentum, driving shareholder value.\nEverest Global plc is committed to a clear and focused strategy of growth. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities, with a view to further increasing our value and shareholder returns.\nThe Board acknowledges that the Group operates in a dynamic market and is subject to various risks. A comprehensive risk management framework is in place to identify, assess, and mitigate these risks and is detailed below.\nThe six-month period ended 30 April 2025 has been a testament to the successful execution of our strategic vision. The remarkable turnaround from a significant loss to a healthy profit, coupled with substantial revenue growth, underscores the strength of our business model and the dedication of our team.\nDuring the period, the Company issued issue a further \u00a3250,000 convertible loan notes (CLN) to Surich Real Estate Opportunity Fund SPC (\"SPC\") under the terms of the Loan Note Instrument. Following the issue of these CLN, SPC holds CLN with an aggregate value of \u00a33.25 million. In addition, SPC advanced an amount of approximately \u00a3155,000 (the total investment made in respect",

          "full_content": "28 Feb 2025 07:00\nEverest Global Plc - Final Results\nEverest Global Plc - Final Results\nPR Newswire\nLONDON, United Kingdom, February 28\n28 February\n2025\nEverest Global plc\n(\u201cEverest\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nFinal Results\nThe Board of Everest is pleased to announce its final results for the year ended\n31 October 2024\n.\nThe year ended\n31 October 2024\nwas satisfactory. We acquired\nPrecious Link\n(UK) Limited (\u2018PL\u2019) and have integrated this business into our financial reporting systems. Following the acquisition, we concluded the disposal of Dynamic Intertrade (Pty) Ltd on\n16 January 2024\n.\nOn\n10 January 2024\nthe Company issued 12,500,000 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.02 in the Company to Pi Distribution Investment Ltd (\u2018PI\u2019) as consideration (\u2018Consideration Shares\u2019) for the purchase of PL. The Company further announced that due to an internal restructure of the vendors affairs, PI assigned the Consideration Shares due to it to Mr\nFeng Chen\n, and signed all relevant and required indemnities in favour of, Mr\nFeng Chen\n. Mr\nFeng Chen\nwas the ultimate beneficial owner of PI. As a result, the Consideration Shares were issued to Mr\nFeng Chen\n. This concluded the acquisition of PL.\nAs part of our quest to access further pools of capital we acquired a strategic stake of 33% of the issued share capital of Ace Jumbo Ventures Limited ('AJV') for\nUS$20,000\nfrom Giga Treasure Limited, which was announced on\n9 April 2024\n, but remained subject to regulatory approval. Given regulatory approval had not been granted by the period end the investment in AJV has not been recognised in these accounts. AJV is the parent company of Giga (\nHong Kong\n) Limited, a company incorporated in\nHong Kong\n, which holds a licence to carry out the provision of advice on securities (Type 4 Licence) and a licence to carry out asset management related regulated activities (Type 9 Licence) under the Securities and Futures Ordinance in\nHong Kong\n(the \"Licences\"). The Directors of the Company believe that holding an interest in the Licences will help facilitate future fundraisings to be undertaken by the Company from investors based in\nHong Kong\n. The Company also purchased a\nHong Kong\nincorporated company called Everest (\nHong Kong\n) Securities Limited ('EHKS'), for\nHK$1\nwith the intention of facilitating capital raising. EHKS at the time of purchase was a dormant entity and at the time of signing these accounts, remains dormant. Once trading however, the Directors believe that EHKS will enhance the credibility and hence the ability, for the Group to raise capital in\nChina\nand\nHong Kong\n.\nThe Company did not undertake any further operational acquisitions during the period as the Board considered the risk profiles of the businesses reviewed were not appropriate in terms of risk or capital structure. We continue to actively seek other strategic acquisitions.\nFrom a capital raising perspective, the Company raised funds via the issue of CLN\u2019s, which has been used for working capital. Any excess capital has been applied to short term lending to external parties. It will give the Company the ability to have resources should an appropriate acquisition present itself and the loans are all repayable in less than 1 year. The loans even though not repayable on demand, have short term maturity dates. If an acquisition where to present itself, we wouldn\u2019t continue to lend the funds out and be able to recoup the funds back into the Group. The time horizon on a new purchase from identification to completing due diligence and finally purchasing, would allow all loans to be repaid.\nOn\n28 August 2024\nthe Company received \u00a33.00 million from the subscription of New Convertible Loan Notes. These were part of the constituted loan note instrument pursuant to which the Company may issue up to \u00a350 million convertible loan notes (\u201cCLNs\u201d) in tranches of \u00a3250,000 at any time. Each tranche of CLNs will have an initial term of 3 years from the date of the certificate being issued to the relevant noteholder (the \u2018Loan Note Instrument\u2019).\nDuring the year, the Company issued 12 unsecured CLNs to Surich Real Estate Opportunity Fund SPC (\u2018SPC\u2019 or the \u2018Noteholder\u2019 respectively) in an aggregate value of \u00a33.00m. SPC is wholly owned and controlled by Mr\nZiwei Peng\n. Mr Peng is the owner and controller of Golden Nice International Group Limited, which holds a 24.55% interest in the issued share capital of the Company. Given Mr Peng\u2019s holding in the Company, the issue of the CLNs to SPC is a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 7.3 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe material terms of the CLNs are:\n- the aggregate principal amount of the CLNs is limited to \u00a350m and they will be issued in integral multiples of \u00a3250,000;\n- the CLNs issued pursuant to the Loan Notes Instrument are unsecured;\n- the term of each tranche of CLNs is 3 years from the date of the certificate of the applicable CLNs;\n- they are convertible into ordinary shares of \u00a30.02 each in the issued share cap",

At the end of the previous financial year, on\n31 October 2023\n, the Company announced the issue of a prospectus in relation to the admission of 39,099,141 ordinary shares of \u00a30.02 each ('Ordinary Shares') to the Official List of the FCA (Standard Listing Segment) and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. We further announced on the\n6 November 2023\nthat the Ordinary Shares were listed and dealing could commence on that day. The total number of Ordinary Shares at that date was 64,888,855.\nFollowing the advance, on\n4 July 2023\n, of \u00a3200,000 to\nPrecious Link\n(UK) Limited ('PL') the Company announced the acquisition from PI Distribution Investment Ltd ('PI'), of the entire issued share capital of PL. PL is a wine retailer, which consists of 2 retail liquor outlets in the Southeast of\nEngland\n. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement ('SPA') and a subsequent restructure of the vendors affairs, the Company issued 12,500,000 new Ordinary Shares to Mr\nFeng Chen\n(the ultimate beneficial owner of PI), at a value of\n4 pence\nper Ordinary Share, valuing the transaction at \u00a3500,000. The \u00a3200,000 loan between PL and the Company will remain in force and the director of PL has assigned his loan of circa \u00a3500k, at the date of acquisition, due to him from PL to the Company, as a condition of the SPA. As a result of the transaction the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue, on the\n30 April 2024\n, was 77,388,855 Ordinary Shares.\nIn\nJanuary 2024\n, following the acquisition of PL, the Company and K2 Spice Limited ('K2') exercised the put and call option agreement which was detailed in the Annual Financial Statements for the year ended\nOctober 2022\n. This resulted in the Company selling its remaining 51% holding in Dynamic Intertrade (Pty) Ltd ('DI') to K2, which now owns 100% of the issued shares in DI.\nAnother initiative that the Company embarked on was the acquisition of 33% of the issued share capital of Ace Jumbo Ventures Limited ('AJV') for\nUS$20,000\nin cash from Giga Treasure Limited which, was announced on\n9 April 2024\n, but remained subject to regulatory approval. Given regulatory approval had not been granted by period end the investment in AJV has not been recognised in these interim accounts. AJV is the parent company of Giga (\nHong Kong\n) Limited, a company incorporated in\nHong Kong\n, which holds a licence to carry out the provision of advice on securities (Type 4 Licence) and a licence to carry out asset management related regulated activities (Type 9 Licence) under the Securities and Futures Ordinance in\nHong Kong\n(the \"Licences\"). The Directors of the Company believe that holding an interest in the Licences will help facilitate future fundraisings to be undertaken by the Company from investors based in\nHong Kong\n. Post the period end, the Company also purchased a\nHong Kong\nincorporated company called Everest (\nHong Kong\n) Securities Limited ('EHKS'), for\nHK$1\nwith the intention of facilitating capital raising. EHKS at the time of purchase was a dormant entity and had been since incorporation. At the time of signing these accounts EHKS remained dormant.\nThe Company, at the reporting date of these interim accounts, had only one wholly owned subsidiary, PL, which was consolidated for the 4-month period from\n1 January 2024\nto\n30 April 2024\n. The results of DI, which was sold in\nJanuary 2024\n, have been consolidated for the period\n1 October 2023\nto\n31 December 2023\n.\nWithin the first six months, as a result of the transactions the Company has undertaken, the consolidated financial picture has changed. The revenues are down 65% compared to the six months ending\n30 April 2023\n. Additionally, the cost of sales is also down to 64%, which means we have a greater gross profit margin of 27% in the first six months of this financial year compared to 30% in the comparative six month period.\nThere is a significant other income position. This is the result of the sale of DI and unwinding of its consolidated balance sheet that was undertaken as part of the disposal of DI in\nJanuary 2024\n.\nAs at\n30 April 2024\n, the Group, had cash of approximately \u00a3228,000 down from approximately \u00a3858,000 as at\n31 October 2023\n.\nFinally,",

With that said we consider it successful in terms of achieving what we set out to achieve.\nIn\nOctober 2022\n, the Company name was changed to Everest Global Plc and a new board was constituted. The new board has integrated well and is working particularly well together. Much was achieved in the past 12 months.\nIn late 2022 our existing auditors resigned as they exited the Public Interest Entity ('PIE') audit space which left the business without an auditor. It took some time to appoint a PIE registered auditor, with a false start announced in\nDecember 2022\n. Eventually in\nApril 2023\na PIE registered auditor, RPG Crouch Chapman LLP ('RPGCC') was appointed. The Annual Financial Statements for\nOctober 2022\nwere produced and lodged late on\n27 July 2023\n. Both Companies House and the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') were informed of the Company's situation. During this period the shares were suspended by the FCA. On\n4 August 2023\nthe suspension was lifted.\nNew shareholders invested in the Company on\n23 January 2023\n. 12,726,000 new Ordinary Shares were issued at a subscription price of\n5.5 pence\nper share raising a total of \u00a3699,930. The subscription price represented a premium of 119 per cent to the closing price of\n2.51 pence\non\n19 January 2023\n. Allied to this on\n25 January 2023\nGolden Nice International Group Limited, the major shareholder, converted \u00a3300,000 convertible loan notes ('CLNs') to 6,000,000 new Ordinary Shares. The conversion price being\n5 pence\nper share. This represented a premium of 85 per cent to the closing price of\n2.70 pence\non\n23 January 2023\n. On\n29 September 2023\n, Golden Nice International Group Limited, being the holder of the outstanding CLNs in the Company, agreed to extend the redemption date by 18 months from\n30 September 2023\nto\n31 March 2025\n, at a conversion price of\n5 pence\nper share.\nOn\n31 October 2023\nthe Company issued a prospectus. This allowed the shares issued since\n3 October 2022\nto be listed. The shares were as follows:\nNumber of Ordinary Shares immediately prior to prospectus\n25,789,714\nNumber of Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the previously announced subscriptions\n25,726,000\nNumber of Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the previously announced conversions\n13,373,141\nTotal number of Ordinary Shares in issue and listed on 31 October 2023\n64,888,855\nOn\n4 July 2023\nthe Company advanced \u00a3200,000 to PL as part of its strategic pivot. The Company was of the opinion that PL operated in a complementary sector and would therefore assist the Company in expanding its activities into the wider food and beverage sector. Post year-end, on\n10 January 2024\n, the Company completed the acquisition of PL which was announced on\n18 December 2023\n. The acquisition price for 100% of PL, was \u00a3500,000, to be settled by the issue of 12,500,000 new Ordinary Shares at a value of\n4 pence\nper Ordinary Share, being a premium of 23.08 per cent, compared to the closing middle market price of\n3.25 pence\nper Ordinary Share on\n15 December 2023\n. PL is a wine retailer consisting of 2 retail liquor outlets in the Southeast of\nEngland\n. The Company would like to assist in expanding the footprint and product range of PL.\nFollowing the acquisition of PL, the Company and K2 Spice Limited ('K2') exercised the put and call option agreement which was detailed in the previous Annual Financial Statements for the year ended\nOctober 2022\n. This resulted in the Company selling its remaining 51% holding in Dynamic Intertrade (PTY) Ltd ('DI') in\nJanuary 2024\n. I would like to thank the team at DI. The Company currently has only one subsidiary, although the results for DI have been fully consolidated for the year ended\nOctober 2023\n.\nThe focus for 2024 will be the growth in the food and beverage business via acquisition and joint ventures. The Company will be looking for additional capital during the next financial year in order to build up a war chest to allow it to acquire operating assets. The additional funding available to PL following the acquisition is expected to lead to growth due to development of new sites and extending the product range.\nWe are looking forward to a busy year ahead.\nThe financial information set out below does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for the years ended\n31 October 2022\nor 2023 within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006, but is derived from those accounts. Statutory accounts for 2022 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2023 will be delivered in due course.

In such circumstances, the directors are required under section 656 of the Companies Act 2006 to convene a general meeting of the Company for the purpose of considering whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken in relation to the situation.\nAccordingly, this matter will be discussed at this GM.\nThe Board welcomes dialogue with the Company's shareholders, and the GM will provide a forum for such discussions to take place, but no resolutions will be proposed at the GM in relation to the serious loss of capital.\nThe formal notice of GM is set out on pages 4 to 6 of the Notice of GM.

The Company also changed its name to Everest Global Plc, both\nAndrew Monk\nand\nMatt Bonner\nresigned from the Board and\nSimon Grant-Rennick\nand I were appointed to the Board. .\nDuring the current reporting period, on the\n24 January 2023\n, the Company announced a subscription for 12,726,000 new Ordinary Shares raising net proceeds totalling \u00a3699,930 at a subscription price of\n5.5 pence\nper Ordinary Share. In addition, on\n25 January 2023\n, the convertible loan note holder, Golden Nice International Limited converted \u00a3300,000 of its debt to 6,000,000 new Ordinary Shares.\nDue to the number of new shares issued in the period under review and on\n3 October 2022\n, in order to comply with Prospectus Regulation Rule 1.2.4, which prohibits the admission of more than 20% of the number of securities already admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange without a prospectus, the Company is working towards publishing a prospectus in relation to the issue of the these shares, by\n2 October 2023\n, in order to enable them to be admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in accordance with Listing Rule 14.3.4.\nThis has been the first reporting period that the Company is operating as Everest Global Plc with the new reconstituted board for the full period and I am pleased to announce that the board is working very well together despite the head winds. The board is clear on its mandate and strategy and is working towards achieving this.\nPost period end, the Company announced on the\n4 July 2023\n, that it had invested \u00a3200,000 by way of a loan into\nPrecious Link\n(UK) Limited, a wine retailer, located within the Southeast of\nEngland\n. The Board believes that\nPrecious Link\noperates in a complementary sector and that the loan could assist the Company in expanding its activities into the wider food and beverage sector.\nAs mentioned in the Annual Financial Statements for the year ended\n31 October 2022\n, and simultaneous to the investment by Golden Nice International Limited, Dynamic Intertrade (Pty) Limited (\u201cDynamic\u201d) issued shares to K2 Spice Limited (previously VSA NEX Investments Limited) (\u201cK2\u201d), for consideration of\nZAR10,982\n, such that Everest Global retains 51% interest in Dynamic and K2 now holds 49% of Dynamic. Further, the Company granted K2 a put option for \u00a31 to acquire the remaining 51% once certain conditions have been met. In addition, certain debts owing by Dynamic to the Company and certain other parties were also assigned to K2 in consideration for K2 paying to the Company \u00a3100,001 and agreeing to fund Dynamic so as to enable Dynamic to carry on its business in the ordinary course until such time as the Company ceases to hold any further shares in Dynamic.\nThe Company\u2019s present primary operations and source of revenue remains its 51% holding in Dynamic, our\nCape Town\nbased spice blender and trader. The underlying Company was still loss making for the year ended\n31 October 2022\n(see Note 4 for a full explanation) but has since improved its performance during the six-months ended\n30 April 2023\n. Group turnover increased by 20.98% (6 months to\n30 April 2022\n: a reduction of 13.5%). Group operating losses amounted to \u00a31,380,631 (6 months to\n30 April 2022\n: \u00a311,176) for the current period.\nDuring the period our previous auditor resigned as they were no longer in a position to audit Public Interest Entity (\u201cPIE\u201d) companies and due to capacity constraints with many other auditors there was a delay in appointing a PIE registered auditor. As a result, the Company could not complete their statutory audit, publication of results or statutory filing at Companies House on time. As such, trading in the Company\u2019s Ordinary Shares and its listing on the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority was suspended.\nThe Company was granted an extension of its filing obligations by Companies House.\nDynami",

The remainder of the convertible loan notes (35%) were converted by the note holders to shares in the Company. In addition, Golden Nice International Limited invested \u00a3650,000 in the Company to recapitalise it by the subscription of 13 million new ordinary shares. The company then changed its name to Everest Global Plc at this time. In addition, both\nAndrew Monk\nand\nMatt Bonner\nresigned from the Board and\nSimon Grant-Rennick\nand I were appointed to the Board.\nRobert Scott\nremains on the Board. I would like to thank both\nAndrew Monk\nand\nMatt Bonner\nfor their services to the company.\nAs mentioned in the previous Annual Financial Statements the Company\u2019s subsidiary, Dynamic Intertrade (Pty) Limited (\u201cDynamic\u201d), on its own could not sustain a London Stock Exchange listing. During the period under review the Company and VSA NEX Investments Limited (\u201cVSA NEX\u201d) entered into certain related party arrangements in relation to Dynamic. At the time the arrangements were entered into VSA NEX was a 100% subsidiary of VSA Capital. Also at the time the arrangements were entered into\nAndrew Monk\nwas a director of the Company, VSA Capital and VSA NEX and is deemed to have significant influence over VSA Capital and VSA NEX. Pursuant to the arrangements, VSA NEX subscribed for such number of new shares in the capital of Dynamic resulting in VSA NEX holding 49% of the enlarged issued share capital of Dynamic for a consideration of\nZAR10,982\n; the Company agreed to assign certain debts owing by Dynamic, amounting to \u00a34.2 million which had been fully impaired in prior years, to the Company and certain other parties to VSA NEX in consideration for VSA NEX paying to the Company \u00a3100,001 and agreeing to fund Dynamic so as to enable Dynamic to carry on its business in the ordinary course until such time as the Company ceases to hold any further shares in Dynamic. This assignment agreement resulted in VSA NEX having a non-controlling interest in Dynamic and as such its share of the current year profits amounted to \u00a3522, its share of accumulated losses prior to acquisition amounted to \u00a32,305,905. Additionally, the assignment of the loans resulted in the Group incurring a finance charge on consolidation of \u00a33.1 million. VSA NEX has signed a subordination agreement in relation to the loans due by Dynamic to VSA NEX with an expiry date of\n31 October 2023\n. Should VSA NEX choose to request the repayment of the loans due by Dynamic this will severely impact the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Upon consolidation of the VSA NEX loans, the borrowings have increased by\u00a34.1 million. Under a put and call option agreement the Company granted to VSA NEX the option to acquire 11,430 shares in Dynamic Intertrade, being the remaining 51% of Dynamic held by the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and subject to certain time restrictions for \u00a31.\nAt\n31 October 2022\nDynamic was still controlled by Everest Global and has been consolidated in the group financial statements\nThe Company\u2019s present primary operations and source of revenue remains it 51% holding in Dynamic, our\nCape Town\nbased spice blender and trader. The Company was still loss making for the year under review but has since improved its performance during the six-months ended\nApril 2023\n. Group turnover increased by 20.98% (2021: a reduction of 20.8%). Group operating losses amounted to \u00a31,152,170 (2021: \u00a3515,660) for the current year. The total Group comprehensive loss for the year amounted to \u00a34,570,562 (2021: \u00a3584,633), including the finance charge on consolidation referred to above, amounting to \u00a33,131,890.\nThe Company will now be actively looking at new opportunities to bolster its current operating assets and will no doubt in the near future seeks to raise more funds and acquire more assets. As announced on the 4th\nJuly 2023\n, the Company announced that it had invested \u00a3200,000 by way of a loan into\nPrecious Link\n(UK) Limited, a wine retailer, located within the Southeast of\nEngland\n. The Board believe that\nPrecious Link\noperates in a complementary sector and that the loan could assist the Company in expanding its activities into the wider food and beverage sector.\nPost year end our previous auditor resigned as they were no longer in a position to audit Public Interest Entity (\u201cPIE\u201d) companies and due to capacity constrain",
