          "content": "22 Oct 2025 08:59\nRNS Number : 3870E\nContango Holdings PLC\n22 October 2025\n22 October 2025\nContango Holdings PLC\n(\"Contango\" or the \"Company\")\nVariation to Strategic Partnership for Muchesu\nContango Holdings Plc, a company focused on unlocking value from the +2 billion tonne Muchesu coal project in Zimbabwe (\"Muchesu\"), advises that it has agreed a variation to the previously reported Strategic Partnership with Huo Investments (Pvt) Limited (\"Huo Investments\" or the \"Investor\").\nBackground\nAs announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\").\nDuring 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following:\n\u00b7\nExpansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu;\n\u00b7\nInstallation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant;\n\u00b7\nSubstantial infrastructure works; and\n\u00b7\nInstallation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure.\nFurther operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update.\nWith the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement.\nVariation to the Definitive Agreements\nAsset-Level Purchase\nMuchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\").\nThe Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe.\nPGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project.\nThe purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.\nThe revised ownership of Monaf is therefore as follows:\nShareholder\nHolding\nPGI\n51.0%\nContango\n24.0%\nLilyone Investments\n6.5%\nLocal Minority Shareholders\n18.5%\nUS$20,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility\nPGI will now become the lender under the US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement. Funds advanced to date by Huo Investments are recognised and assumed by PGI. As previously disclosed, advances under the facility rank\npari passu\nwith the loans provided by Contango to Monaf (approximately US$20 million, the \"CGO Debt\"). Any repayments by Monaf to PGI under the facility will require an equal payment to Contango until the CGO Debt is repaid in full.\nSubscription and Royalty Agreements\nThere is no change to the 20.42% shareholding held by Huo Investments in Contango.\nThere is no change to the terms of the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Royalties remain payable by Monaf to Contango for the life of mine as follows:\n\u00b7\nUS$2 per tonne\n- thermal coal\n\u00b7\nUS$4 per tonne\n- industrial coal\n\u00b7\nUS$8 per tonne\n- coking coal\nA minimum US$2 million per annum royalty is payable, uncapped. PGI has confirmed that the next minimum royalty payment of US$1 million will be made in the current quarter. The Definitive Agreements now record that royalty payments to Contango will be made in priority, followed by payments relating to the CGO Debt and the revolving facility on an equal basis.\nCommenting, Daniel Dos Santos, CEO of Contango, said:\n\"These variations strengthen the partnership structure at Muchesu and introduce PGI, part of Pacific Goal Group, as a committed strategic investor with an established operational footprint in Zimbabwe. Their industrial investments, including power, logistics and processing infrastructure, are highly complementary to the long-term development of Muchesu.\nAt the same time, Huo Investments remains supportive through its shareholding and previous contributions to advancing the site. We look forward to providing a further operational update shortly, as activity on the ground continues to build momentum.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Mr Dos Santos is the Chief Executive Officer of Discovery Resources (Pvt) Ltd (\"Discovery Resources\"), a company he founded in 2013. Discovery Resources is a commodity brokerage business specialising in mineral transactions and has brokered a number of high-value mining deals across the Southern African region, in lithium, gold, chrome and coal. In 2015 Mr Dos Santos founded ZW Investments (PTY) Ltd (\"ZWI\"), a Zimbabwe-based intermediary with a focus on natural resources and real estate. In his roles at Discovery Resources and ZWI, Mr Dos Santos has been influential in the financing and development of a number of mines in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa.\nIn June 2024, Mr Dos Santos was appointed as a director of Monaf Investments (Private) Limited, the in-country operating company of the Muchesu project, where he has focused on developing the relationship with Huo Investments as the Definitive Agreements are finalised.\nIn line with the Company's remuneration policy, Mr Dos Santos has agreed to receive a gross annual salary of \u00a336,000.\nFollowing Mr Dos Santos' appointment, Carl Esprey has resigned from his role as CEO. Mr Esprey will continue as an Executive Director of the Company for a period of six months to help manage the transition and ensure continuity with the Company's shareholders. During this time, Mr Esprey will receive a gross annual salary of \u00a318,000, in line with other Directors of the Company.\nThere are no further disclosures required for the purposes of UKLR 6.4.6R and UKLR 6.4.8R.\nDanny dos Santos, new CEO, commented:\n\"I am delighted to join the board of Contango as CEO. I have been involved with the Muchesu project since 2024 and am excited by its scale and potential. During this time I have also focused on the development of the relationship with Huo Investments, as it continues to invest in the site and operations. I expect the Definitive Agreements to be finalised in the near term and am optimistic additional opportunities to further unlock the value of the Muchesu coal project will emerge in the future.\"\nCarl Esprey, CEO, commented:\n\"I would like to welcome Danny to the CGO Board. He has extensive experience within Southern Africa and is very familiar with the Muchesu project. Perhaps most importantly, he is ideally positioned to continue to strengthen the relationship with our Zimbabwe-based partner, Huo Investments.\n\"With a supportive investor and partner, I feel now is the right time for me to step down. The Company is significantly derisked with royalty payments underway. Accordingly, the role of CEO is now best served by someone in-country who can strengthen relationships and help drive Muchesu forward.\"\nGordon Thompson, Chairman, commented:\n\"On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Carl for all of his efforts. Carl has helped ensure he leaves the Company on a stable financial footing as it looks to the future as a royalty company. Contango will continue to benefit from its minority interest in the expanding Muchesu project, as well as the repayment of historic investment of circa US$20,000,000, as encapsulated in the previously reported Definitive Agreements.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014, as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Ms Huo is a director and 50% shareholder of Huo Investments (Pvt) Limited (\"Strategic Investor\"), which is the largest shareholder of the Company, with a holding of 20.42%. Ms Huo is the daughter of Wencai Huo, who owns the balance of 50% of the Strategic Investor. Therefore, her appointment as Non-Executive Director may not be considered an independent role.\nIn line with the Company's remuneration policy, which seeks to minimise Board costs, Ms Huo has agreed to receive a gross annual salary of \u00a318,000, consistent with the compensation of the Company's other Non-Executive Directors.\nThere are no further disclosures required for the purposes of UKLR 6.4.6R and UKLR 6.4.8R.\nIn addition, Roy Pitchford has elected to step down from the Board as Chairman to pursue other interests. Roy has served as Chairman since the IPO in 2020 and brought his extensive mining, operational and in-country experience to the Board. His efforts and guidance during this period are greatly appreciated by the Board.\nExisting Non-Executive Director Gordon Thompson will now assume the role of Non-Executive Chairman of the Board with immediate effect.\nMs Huo, Non-Executive Director, commented:\n\"I am delighted to join the Board at this pivotal time for the Company. On behalf of the Strategic Investor, we look forward to assisting the Company and fellow board members unlock the value at Muchesu for all shareholders. We are highly focused on developing Muchesu and have already committed considerable amount of time, capital and resources, which we will continue to do, with the objective of building a solid mining operation at Muchesu that can then deliver sustainable value for all the stakeholders.\"\nRoy Pitchford, outgoing Chairman, commented:\n\"I am proud of what Contango has achieved in Zimbabwe over the last few years, particularly given the broader global investment climate. Whilst I appreciate the project has suffered from setbacks in the past, I believe the Company has a very bright outlook and that shareholders will be duly rewarded for their patience, particularly with the support of the new strategic investors. With the Company now transitioning to a royalty company I believe it is the right time for me to step down, however, I will follow the Company with great interest as a supportive shareholder.\"\nCarl Esprey, CEO, commented:\n\"On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Roy for his support, input and advice over the last five years. He has helped the Company navigate what have been globally challenging times and we wish him well in his future endeavours.\n\"At the same time, I am delighted to welcome Ms Huo to the Board. Her family investment vehicle has made material investment into Muchesu and Contango, especially over the last six months. Ms Huo's appointment to the board is the natural next step, further aligning the interests of the Company and the Strategic Investor, enabling both to benefit from the Strategic Investor's expertise in mining, in-country network and financial resources.\n\"As the Company evolves, so too should its Board. Today's changes are the first steps in positioning the Company for future expansion as a listed plc. We expect further changes to the Board as we continue to roll out our royalty strategy and intend to provide a further update in the near term.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014, as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The decision to transition to a royalty focused company has removed a number of the previous risks associated with being the sole mine operator at Muchesu. This strategy not only offers our investors significant growth potential but also protects shareholders from changes to future operating, as well as capital expenditure and working capital funding requirements. Moreover, the Company has now resized its cost base and expects to see the benefits of a leaner organisation flow through in the next financial year.\n\"The Investor has demonstrated his support for the Project by advancing an initial $1,000,000 in July 2024 against a future equity subscription into the Company. A Prospectus was published in January 2025, leading to an additional payment of $1,000,000 by the Investor, enabling the closing of the envisaged $2,000,000 equity placing, which in turn has made the Investor the largest shareholder in the Company, owning approximately 20%. Moreover, during the period the Investor commenced significant material investment into Muchesu to expand operations and production capacity.\n\"Post period we received our first royalty payments under the proposed MRA, which provides for a minimum of $2,000,000 per annum, although the Company envisages materially higher royalties as operations advance. Accordingly, this has been a transformational period for Contango, and I look forward to sharing further updates with our investors in the coming weeks. We have established a truly collaborative partnership with the Investor and are confident in their ability to deliver a highly profitable operation at Muchesu.\"\nFor further information, please visit www.contango-holdings-plc.co.uk or contact:\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial Limited\nFinancial Adviser & Broker\nJonathan Evans\nT: +44 (0)20 7100 5100\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nFinancial PR & Investor Relations\nSusie Geliher\nT: +44 (0)20 7236 1177\nChairman's Statement\nI am pleased to share my chairman's update as we reflect on a pivotal period for Contango. Throughout this time, we achieved significant progress both operationally and corporately, and I am confident that the Company is poised for a bright and prosperous future.\nAs shareholders are aware, the key milestone for Contango during this period was the strategic partnership formed with our Investor. This partnership resulted in the acquisition of a 51% stake in Muchesu and a subscription for approximately 20% of Contango's shares. This collaboration has proven transformative, driving significant progress at Muchesu and redefining our long-term growth vision for Contango.\nOur relationship with the Investor continues to flourish, with significant funds already injected into the Muchesu project. As reported post period end, the dense media separation ('DMS') plant has now been successfully installed, commissioned and calibrated, marking a major milestone. The plant, with an estimated capacity of 3,000 tonnes of washed coal per day, is now operational, setting the stage for ramping up production as planned. We have also been advised by the Investor that a second DMS plant has been ordered and we expect to see the full benefits of these and other upgrades as we progress throughout 2025.\nAlongside the ongoing upgrades to the processing infrastructure at Muchesu, efforts have also focused on expanding the open pit, which unlocks access to substantial additional resources, ensuring a long-term, sustainable supply of coking coal. As we near the commencement of full-scale mining operations, we remain confident in Muchesu's",

This brings the total royalty receipts to date under the previously reported Mineral Royalty Agreement (\"MRA\") with Huo Investments (Pvt) Limited (the \"Investor\") to US$500,000. The balancing US$500,000 payment under the previously reported US$1,000,000 is expected to be made later this month.\nAs previously reported, the Company is entering into a series of agreements with the Investor, including the MRA, a Revolving Facility Agreement of US$20,000,000 (\"RFA\"), as well as entering into a change of ownership of Monaf Investments (Private) Limited, the subsidiary that holds the Muchesu Project (collectively the \"Definitive Agreements\"). The Company is targeting signing the final Definitive Agreements in the current quarter, although as previously noted the Investor commenced material investment under the RFA during the second half of 2024 (see RNS of 31 October and 29 November 2024) and has also commenced payments under the MRA.\nIn addition, following the publication of a Short Form Prospectus (\"SFP\") in January 2025, the Company has completed the previously reported US$2,000,000 Subscription with the Investor, who is now the largest shareholder of the Company with an interest of 20.42%.\nCarl Esprey, CEO Of Contango, commented:\n\"This additional royalty payment from the Investor under the proposed MRA further strengthens the Company's capital position and continues the highly collaborative relationship. Following the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations and return of key personnel to Zimbabwe we look forward to finalising the remaining outstanding documentation for the Definitive Agreements and bringing the broader transaction to a successful conclusion.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014, as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Combined these will bring total royalty receipts to US$1,000,000 as envisaged and previously reported under the Mineral Royalty Agreement (\"MRA\") with Huo Investments (Pvt) Limited (the \"Investor\").\nUnder the MRA the Company will be paid a minimum of US$2,000,000 per annum, with additional amounts to be paid based on amount of coal production. A further minimum US$1,000,000 royalty payment is expected around the end of Q1 2025. Thereafter additional royalty payments to the Company will be in line with operational productivity at Muchesu. The initial focus of the Investor remains on the production and sale of coking coal, which carries a royalty of US$8/tonne to the Company. The now operational 3,000 tonne per day Dense Media Separation Plant has been tested and calibrated accordingly.\nAs reported during 2024, the Company is entering into a series of agreements with the Investor, including the MRA, a Revolving Facility Agreement of US$20,000,000 (\"RFA\"), as well as entering into a change of ownership of Monaf Investments (Private) Limited, the subsidiary that holds the Muchesu Project (collectively the \"Definitive Agreements\"). The Company intends to sign the final Definitive Agreements this month, although as previously noted the Investor commenced material investment under the RFA during the second half of 2024 (see RNS of 31 October and 29 November 2024), and has also now commenced payments under the MRA.\nThe Company also expects to issue a Short Form Prospectus (\"SFP\"), subject to the approval of the FCA, this month, which will enable the Company to complete the previously reported US$2,000,000 Subscription thus making the Investor the largest shareholder of the Company, further aligning the Investor's interests with the Company.\nCarl Esprey, CEO Of Contango, commented:\n\"\nThis milestone marks a significant step forward in unlocking the immense value of the Muchesu coal project. The receipt of our first royalty payment not only underscores the confidence our partners have in the project's potential but also reinforces our commitment to delivering consistent value for our shareholders. With the operational foundations now firmly in place, we are excited about the continued progress and growth opportunities ahead.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014, as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Also, the Company expects to receive a further minimum royalty payment of US$1m around the end of Q1 2025. These funds amounting to a total of $3m (\u00a32.4m) will principally be used to repay Investor Loans.\nIn addition, the Board expects to receive additional regular royalty income following the commencement of coal production at Muchesu with operations on site now active and the new plant now in the process of being ramped up. The Dense Media Plant (\"DMS\") has a processing capability of 3,000 tonnes per day of coking coal, with a royalty of US$8/t owed to Contango on processed coking coal. The Company has also recently been advised by the strategic investor that an additional DMS Plant has been ordered and is due for delivery in Q1 2025.\nThe Company has agreed with the holders of the Investor Loans that any additional income will initially be applied to the repayment of Investor Loans and for general working capital purposes before the Company implements its intended dividend policy. The Board will continue to update shareholders on the production levels at Muchesu and royalties are paid one month in arrears.\nThe Company notes that the working capital position of the Company is reliant on the receipt of the subscription funds and royalty income. If the Company failed to realise revenue from the receipt of royalty income it would be required to raise further capital or reach a settlement with the holders of the Investor Loans. Following the closing of the Subscription, the Investor will be largest shareholder of the Company and aligned with existing shareholders of the Company.\n**ENDS**\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial Limited\nFinancial Adviser & Broker\nJonathan Evans\nT: +44 (0)20 7100 5100\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nFinancial PR & Investor Relations\nSusie Geliher\nT: +44 (0)20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

An update on the status and developments of these agreements are as follows:\n1. The Investor signed a Subscription Agreement to subscribe for US$2,000,000 new ordinary shares in the Company (\"Subscription\"), conditional on the Company publishing a Short Form Prospectus (\"SFP\"), to allow it to issue more than 20% of its issued share capital in a 12-month period. Following the publication of annual financial statements and audit report for the year ending 31 May 2024 (\"FY2024\") on 22 November 2024, the Company will now be in a position to finalise the SFP and seek approval from the FCA for its publication and consequent closing of the Subscription. The Investor will be the largest shareholder of the Company following the Subscription, thus being aligned with existing shareholders. The Investor has already advanced $1,000,000 to the Company.\n2. The Company and the Investor are finalising the change in ownership of Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"), the subsidiary that holds the Muchesu project. The Company will reduce its holding from 74.75% to 23.75% in Monaf with the investor taking a majority holding of 51%. In consideration of obtaining a controlling position in Monaf, the Investor will commit a minimum of US$20,000,000 through a Revolving Facility Agreement (\"RFA\") to invest and expand operations at Muchesu. Also, the Investor has entered into a Mineral Royalty Agreement (\"MRA\") with the Company so that Contango shall earn a royalty on coals produced. Both the RFA and MRA are nearing completion having sought the requisite approvals, as appropriate, in Zimbabwe. The Company previously announced that the Investor has already committed material investment at Muchesu to date under the RFA, whilst these documents are pending completion. This has brought forward the development of Muchesu and underlines the highly collaborative relationship between the Investor and the Company.\nOperational Update\nAs announced on 31 October 2024, the Investor has made material investments at Muchesu, most notably through:\ni) the construction of a 3,000 tonne per day Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") Plant; and\nii) the significant expansion of the open pit to enable higher mining and processing capacity.\nThe DMS installation is now complete. Testing and calibration has been underway since mid-November and the Company expects production and processing to commence imminently. As previously reported the DMS plant has been calibrated to process readily available coking coal. Under the MRA, a royalty of US$8 per tonne is payable to Contango for washed coking coal on a monthly basis in arrears.\nThe Investor has also ordered a second DMS plant under the RFA, which is expected to be delivered to site during Q1 2025, ahead of subsequent assembly and testing. This will coincide with further capital investment to unlock additional revenue streams from Muchesu coal.\nFinancial Update\nThe Company's working capital position will be improved following the receipt of funds from the Subscription (which is subject to the SFP), which the Company expects to close imminently and the receipt of an additional $1,000,000 in December 2024 under the terms of the minimum annual royalty payment in the MRA. The Company is proposing to use these funds to fund the Company's general working capital and repay loans outstanding.\nUnder the MRA, the Company will be paid a minimum of US$2,000,000 per annum, with additional amounts to be paid based on the amount of coal produced at Muchesu. The Investor has confirmed an inaugural royalty payment of US$1,000,000 will be made in December 2024, with a second minimum US$1,000,000 expected around the end of Q1 2025. Thereafter the additional royalty payments to the Company will be in line with operational productivity at Muchesu.\nContango previously funded the development of Muchesu through loans to Monaf. These loans equate to approximately US$20,000,000. It has been agreed with the investor and enshrined in the RFA that these loans from Contango will be repaid by Monaf on a 50-50 basis with the US$20,000,000 currently being leant to Monaf by the Investor for the development of Muchesu. For the avoidance of doubt, this debt repayment to Contango from Monaf is in addition to the royalty payments owed to Contango under ",

The closing of the US$2,000,000 was subject to the issuance of a Short Form Prospectus (\"SFP\") to allow the Company to issue more than 20% of its issued share capital in a 12-month period. The Company expects to issue the SFP shortly following the publication of its Audited Annual Report and Financial Statements for the 12-month financial period ended 31 May 2024 (the \"2024 Annual Report\").\nPublication of the 2024 Annual Report\nMoore Kingston Smith LLP (\"MKS\") was appointed as auditor to the Company in July 2024 and is currently finalising the 2024 Annual Report. The latest advice from MKS is the report will be ready for publication in approximately two weeks. Once published the Company will arrange to lift the temporary suspension from trading on the London Stock Exchange so that the shares may commence trading again.\nProject Investment under the Revolving Facility Agreement (\"RFA\")\nThe Investor has continued to make material investments at Muchesu throughout October under the US$20,000,000 RFA. The primary areas of the mine to receive investment are:\ni) the construction of a 3,000 tonne per day Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") Plant; and\nii) the significant expansion of the open pit to enable higher mining and processing capacity.\nThe DMS installation is nearing completion, with testing and commissioning expected in the first half of November, ahead of the start of production and processing in the second half of November. As previously reported the DMS plant will be calibrated to process readily available coking coal. Under the Mineral Royalty Agreement (\"MRA\") entered into with the Investor, a royalty of US$8 per tonne is payable to Contango for washed coking coal on a monthly basis in arrears.\nA minimum of US$2,000,000 per annum is payable in terms of royalties to Contango, however the Company expects to benefit by materially higher royalty payments. In keeping with the highly collaborative relationship, the Investor has confirmed an inaugural royalty payment of US$1,000,000 will be made before the end of 2024, with a second US$1,000,000 expected around the end of Q1 2025. Thereafter the additional royalty payments to the Company will be in line with operational productivity at Muchesu.\nThe Investor has also advised it intends to deliver at least one further DMS plant to site under the RFA along with further capital investment to unlock additional revenue streams from Muchesu coal.\nCarl Esprey, CEO of Contango, commented:\n\"During October we have continued to see material investment into the Muchesu site. Visually the landscape is changing on a weekly basis and the speed of that change is very exciting. Muchesu has always been a world class deposit, and it is now benefiting from the level of investment required to unlock its full potential.\n\"Whilst I understand shareholder's frustrations over the temporary suspension, this too is expected to be lifted in the very near term following the completion of the audit and publication of the 2024 Accounts, which will coincide with the commencement of processing operations in earnest at site.\n\"With the expectation of a first royalty payment this year and welcoming the Investor as the largest shareholder in the Company following the issue of the SFP, the outlook for the Company is looking overwhelmingly positive.\n\"We look forward to providing further updates as appropriate.\"\n**ENDS**\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial Limited\nFinancial Adviser & Broker\nJonathan Evans\nT: +44 (0)20 7100 5100\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nFinancial PR & Investor Relations\nSusie Geliher / Charlotte Page\nT: +44 (0)20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Work will continue to further expand the open pit, as required, given the size of the Muchesu resource.\nNew open pit area in the foreground (background original CGO open pit)\nMuchesu resource extends beyond open pits to elevated terrain in background\nAlso, the Investor has acquired and delivered a Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") Plant to site. The Company has been advised the DMS has an estimated production capacity of 3,000 tonnes of washed coal per day. The concrete foundations of the DMS plant have now been laid and the DMS plant installation is underway. The Investor has confirmed the target is for the DMS plant to be operational before the end of October 2024. The DMS plant will be calibrated to process coking coal from Muchesu, which is readily available following the aforementioned pit expansion.\nUnder the Mineral Royalty Agreement (\"MRA\") entered with the Investor (see RNS 17 June 2024), a royalty of US$8 per tonne is payable to Contango for washed coking coal, on a monthly basis in arrears. Additional DMS plants are planned to be installed by the investor in the future to further increase production output.\nDMS Plant being installed on concrete foundation\nUpdate on Contango Subscription by the Investor\nThe Investor has entered into a subscription agreement with the Company to subscribe for 142,000,000 new ordinary shares (\"\nSubscription Shares\n\") at a price of \u00a30.0111 pence per share (\"\nSubscription Price\n\"\n).\nThe Company submitted a Short Form Prospectus (\"SFP\") for the FCA to approve in July 2024 and the Company believes an approved version can be published in the near term. The prospectus is required to allow the Company to issue more than 20% of its issued share capital in a 12-month period.\nFinancial\nAs reported on 3 July 2024, the Company has already received a payment of US$1,000,000 as an advance against the Subscription Shares. Outstanding funds from the Subscription will be paid to the Company by the Investor following the approval of the SFP, along with the delivery of shares to the Investor.\nOn 17 June 2024 the Company confirmed the expected headline terms of the Definitive Agreements, which were subsequently formalised on 2 July 2024. This included details of the MRA with the Investor, specifically that a minimum of US$2,000,000 a year royalty would be payable to the Company following a six-month holiday.\nThe Company can now advise it has received confirmation from the Investor that the first US$1,000,000 under the MRA will be paid in Q4 2024, with a second payment around the end of Q1 2025. It should be noted that assuming the DMS plant operates as expected then the royalty payments going forward are expected to be materially higher than the minimum of US$2,000,000 per annum.\n\u200b\nFollowing entering into the Definitive Agreements, in July 2024 the Company changed auditors from Crowe U.K. LLP to Moore Kingston Smith LLP. The audit is making good progress, however given the time of year and site visit requirements as part of the audit process the Company has been advised the audit will likely be completed during October 2024. In the event the Company does not file its audited final results for the year ended 31 May 2024 (\"FY 2024\") before 30 September 2024, the Company will be required to seek approval for a temporary suspension of trading in its shares, until such time as the FY 2024 are published.\nCarl Esprey, Chief Executive Officer of Contango, commented:\n\"I am pleased to provide this positive update on operations in Zimbabwe. Since entering into the Definitive Agreements in July 2024, just over two months ago, the Investor has already committed significant capital into Muchesu and expanded the platform for future production.\n\"Corporately we have addressed our plc creditors following ",

The Subscription is subject to the issuance and approval of a Short Form Prospectus (\"\nSFP\n\"). The Company is pleased to advise it has now submitted a SFP to the FCA for its review and approval.\nFurther, in keeping with the collaborative relationship between the Investor and the Company, the Company is pleased to report it has now received a payment of US$1,000,000, as an advance against the Subscription.\nCommencement of Project Investment under the Revolving Facility Agreement (the \"RFA\")\nAlso as reported on 3 July 2024, the Investor has entered into an RFA, whereby it will provide unsecured debt finance of up to US$20,000,000 into the operating subsidiary Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"\nMonaf\n\"), for the purpose of funding the development and expansion of operations at Muchesu.\nThe Company is pleased to report that under this agreement, the Investor has already commenced delivery of some capital equipment and operational items. The first convoy carrying parts for a new wash plant has arrived at site with the remaining convoys expected to arrive during July. A team of engineers are already on site to oversee operations and the installation of the new wash plant. Upon completion, the wash plant is expected to have a washing capacity of 3,000 tonnes per day, significantly greater than the Company's existing washing capabilities, which will continue to remain operational.\nOrders have now been placed for a further five heavy-duty excavators, four of which are to be delivered from South Africa. Also, another front-end loader and accessories have been ordered. All these items are due at Muchesu before the end of July 2024.\nCarl Esprey, Chief Executive Officer of Contango, commented:\n\"I am delighted to provide this update. It is testament to the Investor's faith in Muchesu that funds have already been advanced into both Contango and at the asset-level whilst we address the remaining conditions precedent for the formal closing of the Definitive Agreements. The Company has now submitted the prospectus pending FCA approval to approve the issue of the Subscription Shares.\n\"We are now seeing significant activity at Muchesu. A new wash plant is being delivered and constructed to materially increase production capacity, whilst other earth moving and processing equipment are expected to arrive on site in the forthcoming weeks. We are also integrating members of the existing operational team with the team assembled by the Investor. We believe the resultant outcome will leave Muchesu on a much firmer footing and poised for significant growth.\n\"Finally, planning is also underway to expand the size of the existing open pit as well as engineering designs for underground mining. These steps should lead to a significant increase in mining output, which the Company stands to benefit from through both its royalty arrangements and residual 24.75% interest in Muchesu. I look forward to keeping shareholders appraised of both operational developments and the formal closing of the Definitive Agreements.\"\nImages showing additional wash plant and equipment:\n**ENDS**\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial Limited\nFinancial Adviser & Broker\nJonathan Evans\nT: +44 (0)20 7100 5100\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nFinancial PR & Investor Relations\nSusie Geliher / Charlotte Page\nT: +44 (0)20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Investor, the Company and Monaf will now look to finalise execute and enter into suite of formal agreements (the \"Definitive Agreements\") to implement the transactions described above.\nThe Definitive Agreements are subject to completion of any outstanding due diligence by the Investor, as well as legal, regulatory and shareholder approvals, which the Company expects to co-ordinate in Q3 2024. The Investor has substantial business operations and investments in Zimbabwe, therefore, is well regarded in the country. Further details are provided below with respect to the Term Sheet. Once the Definitive Agreements have been entered into a General Meeting will be called for Company shareholders to approve the proposed transaction.\n1.

An additional 4.76% interest in Monaf is expected to be transferred to the Company in the near term, increasing Contango's interest to 74.75%. The Term Sheet currently envisages a sale of 51% from Contango's interest in Monaf, with Contango therefore expected to retain a 23.75% stake in Monaf. Completion of the disposal will require the parties to obtain various local approvals.\n2. Cash investment into Contango\nThe Investor will directly, or through affiliate(s) and/or related controlled corporate entities, subscribe for new ordinary shares to be issued by the Company. The Investor will subscribe for an amount that results in a 20% holding of the enlarged share capital of the Company based on a 10-day VWAP share price prior to signing of the Definitive Agreements (the \"Subscription\").\nThe Company will be required to issue a prospectus with regard to the Subscription as it does not currently have the available headroom to issue the quantum of shares. A prospectus will be lodged with the FCA in due course and published following the completion of the Definitive Agreements.\n3. Royalty Agreement with Contango\nUpon execution of the Definitive Agreement and the disposal of 51%, Contango will be awarded royalties on future gross production at Muchesu, for the life of mine as follows:\ni) US$2 royalty per tonne in relation to thermal coal production\nii) US$4 royalty per tonne in relation to industrial coal production\niii) US$8 royalty per tonne in relation to coking coal production\n(collectively the \"Production Royalties\"). Production Royalties are to be paid to CGO on a monthly basis in arrears.\nThe Term Sheet also notes that following a 6-month holiday from entering into the Definitive Agreements, going forward a minimum of US$2M per annum will be owed to Contango, irrespective of the level of production. The Production Royalties will be subject to separate industry standard contractual documentation, with standard protections, and will form part of the Definitive Agreements.\nFollowing completion of the Monaf disposal, Contango will have enshrined rights to maintain the appointment of two directors on the board of Monaf.\n4. Further Investment into Muchesu\nThe Company has historically invested circa US$20M into Monaf by way of a shareholder loans (\"Contango Funding\").

These potential off takers have arranged to collect the two 60-tonne samples this week. Additional samples had already been sent to other identified potential off takers prior to the Placing.\nCollectively ongoing offtake discussions represent demand of more than 50,000 tonnes per month. Whilst the Company does not expect all these discussions to result in a positive outcome, the Company reasonably believes several contracts are likely to materialise from these interested parties during this quarter to June 2024, along with ongoing discussions with respect to coking coal offtake.\nThermal Coal\nA further 250 tonnes of thermal coal has now been extracted and will next week be collected by a potential offtake partner, which will subsequently undertake a 'burn test'. Assuming the results are as expected, the Company believes it will be able to enter into a sizeable long-term thermal offtake contract.\nCorporate Update\nIn conjunction with these operational developments the Company remains engaged with several groups which have expressed interest in a potential Joint Venture and / or purchase of the mine. The Company continues to supply further information to these parties as part of their ongoing due diligence.\nThe Company will provide shareholders with updates on both operational and corporate developments as they materialise. Recent operational videos and images following the Placing will shortly be uploaded to the Company's website and social media accounts, in addition to some images included below, as further background for shareholders.\nCoal being screened and then washed:\nScreened and Washed Coal Awaiting Collection:\n**ENDS**\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial Limited\nFinancial Adviser & Broker\nJonathan Evans\nT: +44 (0)20 7100 5100\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nFinancial PR & Investor Relations\nSusie Geliher / Charlotte Page\nT: +44 (0)20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

The Placing has been conducted within existing share capital authorities and represents approximately 16.6% of the enlarged share capital following Admission of the Placing Shares.\nProject Update\nDuring 2023 the Company finalised all the necessary infrastructure upgrades and installed the necessary capital plant items to enable steady state production to commence from the open pit operations. The Mine was formally opened in August 2023 by a delegation of dignitaries, led by his Excellency Dr Emmerson Mnangagwa, the President of Zimbabwe, with the subsequent intention of commencing stabilised and increasing sales of coking coal under existing offtake arrangements entered into earlier in 2023. As previously reported, this offtake arrangement did not result in the anticipated order for the coal products as initially discussed. Therefore, the Company has subsequently been focused on identifying and securing additional offtake for its coking coal, industrial coal and thermal coal products.\nThe Company is currently in discussions with numerous potential offtake partners, from both domestic and international markets, for its suite of coal products. Some of these ongoing discussions require the Company to provide samples and to perform additional test work as offtake groups require specific specifications for their usage. Accordingly, samples are provided on an ad hoc basis from the relevant stockpiles or freshly cut coal. The Company expects that the outcome from these discussions and work undertaken on the coal to crystalise during Q2 2024.\nWhilst the Company does not expect all of these discussions to result in a positive outcome, the Company reasonably believes that based on the engagement thus far, several contracts are likely to materialise. To quantify, cumulatively these discussions represent more than 50,000 tonnes per month for industrial and coking coal, far exceeding current washing capacity at Muchesu.\nGiven the Company has not derived any sustained material cash flow from operations to date the Placing will allow the Company to strengthen its working capital position to support the ongoing work required for engagement with the various offtake groups and to meet short term creditors who supply products and services for operations in Zimbabwe.\nThe Board has been unilaterally deferring its remuneration since the start of Q4 2023 and will continue to do so until such time that the Company's balance sheet is in a more stable position.\nThermal Coal Opportunities\nThe Company has now commenced extraction from the shallower thermal coal seams to provide product for coal burn tests for certain groups ahead of potential contracts for the sale of thermal coal of a similar tonnage. Whilst thermal coal is a lower margin operation, the potential large quantities of demand could provide material cashflow, especially given it is unlikely to encroach on washing capacity and the Company's surface miner has capacity of circa 1.5 million tonnes per annum.\nFinancial Update\nThe Company's financial position following the Placing will not provide sufficient cash resources to repay outstanding non-secured shareholder loans of \u00a32.7 million, however, these loans were provided by a number of highly supportive and long-standing shareholders. All loan note holders have been appraised of the Placing and the current operational situation and have confirmed they remain supportive of the Company's business plan to reach positive cash flow and a self-sustainable business from operations. Several of the loan note holders have elected to participate in the Placing.\nCorporate Update\nFinally, as previously stated, having built the Mine the Company has received (and continues to receive) interest from a number of strategic groups relating to a variety of structures including JVs or outright purchase at project level. These discussions remain \"live\" with several parties, which have entailed additional site visits, drone surveys, sampling and coal testwork. There is no guarantee any of these discussions will lead to any formal proposal, nor a proposal that may be acceptable to the Board and shareholders. However, the Board believe it is in the best interest of shareholders to continue to engage with these lines of enquiry, whilst in parallel continue t",

In August, the mine was formally opened by his\nExcellency Dr Emmerson Mnangagwa, the President of Zimbabwe. We would like to thank the operational team at Muchesu and stakeholders, whom we look forward to continuing to work with, in partnership with the people of the Binga region, in order to ensure the responsible development of Muchesu. We are focused on unlocking the value of this asset for the benefit of the entire community for years to come.\nOur current focus at Muchesu is the first phase development of Block 2 via an open pit, where extensive work has been undertaken to define the specific properties of the coal. Block 2 contains an estimated 96MT of coking coal, forming a small part of the broader 1.3 billion tonnes, identified under NI 43-101 standard, at Muchesu. During the period, site works and equipment installation were undertaken and completed. This included infrastructure upgrades, as well as installation of screens, washplant, settling ponds, laboratories, weighbridge and pads for coal stockpiles, amongst others. We also opened up the coking coal seam in our open pit following the clearing of the overburden. Despite some delays, which are typical when setting up a new mining operation and building a new mine in an emerging market, with export permits belatedly received in late Q3 2023 the Company is now ready to mine, wash and sell coal to end users.\nDuring the period, the Company also successfully completed the construction of housing and relocation of the villagers in the immediate vicinity of the Muchesu mine. This has been welcomed with resounding positive responses, most importantly from those relocated individuals and the wider community.\nSince formally opening Muchesu, the Company received a non-binding proposal for the potential acquisition of its assets which may result in the sale of its assets at the subsidiary level. Discussions and due diligence remain open and further updates will be made to shareholders as appropriate.\nIn the immediate term, the focus of the Company is to reach a stable state of revenue generation from the sale of Muchesu coal products. The mine development and sales strategy has taken longer than expected but we have built an operation that is now capable of transforming the Company into a sizeable coal producer.\nFinancial Review\nDuring the 6-month period to 31 November 2023, the Company spent \u00a3912,354 on the exploration and fixed assets, which relate to the development of the site and operations at Muchesu.\nThe Company raised \u00a31,305,000 during the period from existing stakeholders through unsecured and non-convertible bridging loans. The funds raised supported capital expenditure and working capital due to the delay of sales under existing offtake arrangements.\nRevenue\nDuring the 6-month period to 31 November 2023, the Company reported revenue of \u00a32,730 from a bulk sample. The Company is now engaging with a number of groups regarding offtake contracts and will update the market in due course.\nAdministrative Costs\nAdministrative costs incurred by the Company as it developed the Muchesu Mine during the period are broken down in Note 3.\nFinance Costs\nFinance costs relate to the loans advanced to the Company during the period.\nLiquidity, cash and cash equivalents\nAs of 30 November 2023, the Company held \u00a390,150 (2022",

Over half of the bulk sample has been mined, screened, washed and is ready for collection, with the balance due later this month.\nYesterday the MNC commenced collection of this coal from mine gate ahead of delivery to its facilities in South Africa for final tests in their own coke batteries. Given historic test work undertaken by the MNC, as well as Contango's ongoing verification of the coal quality and characteristics of the bulk sample, the Company believes there is a high probability of entering into a long-term offtake with this MNC following the successful completion of their tests in January 2024. As previously reported, the MNC has expressed a need for a minimum of approximately 7,000 tonnes per month. However, current discussions are with respect to a larger long-term contract, which the board is inclined to progress with given the complications around the current offtake partner, TransOre, which has not yet provided further orders or payment for washed coking coal as envisaged under the July 2023 offtake agreement.\nIn addition, the Company remains in discussions with other potential off take partners of both coking and industrial coal as per the update of 26 October 2023, which would be envisaged as complementary to any contract with the MNC.\nPhotos of recent and ongoing operations can be found below and also on the Company's social media platforms.\nScreening of coking coal prior to washing\n.\nApproximately 500 tonnes of washed coking coal ready for collection by MNC\nLoading washed coking coal product for MNC\nLoading trucks with washed coking coal product\nFirst five trucks leaving Muchesu with coking coal product\n**ENDS**\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial Limited\nFinancial Adviser & Broker\nJonathan Evans\nT: +44 (0)20 7100 5100\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nFinancial PR & Investor Relations\nSusie Geliher\nT: +44 (0)20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Board is not aware of any changes since its last update of 26 October 2023 that would warrant this price action, nor of any material change in circumstances that would require disclosures.\nFurthermore, the Company notes speculation it is currently looking to raise funds through an equity placement. The Company can confirm it is not currently undertaking an equity raise, nor has it sought to do since its last capital raise of \u00a37.5M at 6 pence per share in Q4 2022, instead it has sourced non-convertible shareholder loans from existing supportive shareholders, as previously reported, to provide working capital ahead of consistent sales.\nThe Company is focused on delivering 1,000t of washed coking coal to a large multi-national company (\"MNC\") this month. The MNC will pay for this bulk sample in advance and the Company expects to be able to deliver the subsequent tonnage for collection by the MNC within the next two weeks. From there the MNC will take the tonnes to its facilities in South Africa to pass through its own coke batteries. Given testwork previously undertaken by the MNC, the Company believes there is a high probability that subsequently a long-term offtake contract will be entered into with this Tier 1 consumer, which has expressed a minimum need of 6,700 tonnes per month of washed coking coal from Muchesu, but has the capacity to enter into a contract materially larger dependent on results from the 1,000t bulk sample and production capacity at Muchesu.\nFinally, as reported on 26 October 2023, the Company received a non-binding proposal for the potential acquisition of its assets. The company making the proposal has subsequently drilled three holes at site, at its own cost, as part of its due diligence process and is reviewing the results. Further updates will be made as appropriate. For the avoidance of doubt the company potentially looking at making an offer for the Company's assets, is different to the MNC currently taking the 1,000 tonnes bulk sample.\n**ENDS**\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial Limited\nFinancial Adviser & Broker\nJonathan Evans\nT: +44 (0)20 7100 5100\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nFinancial PR & Investor Relations\nSusie Geliher\nT: +44 (0)20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Proposal is at an early stage with a number of commercial points under discussion, therefore, there is no guarantee that these discussions will lead to a formal offer. The Company is now in discussions with its advisers with regard to the Proposal and the Board will seek to maximise value for all its stakeholders before pursuing the disposal of its principal assets. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company which has made the Proposal is different to the Multi-National undertaking the coking coal trial as noted below and with whom the Company is discussing a long-term offtake arrangement.\nOperational Update\nLast quarter the Company confirmed construction at site was completed to enable the production and washing of Muchesu coal. At the end of August, the Company received export approvals from the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (\"MMCZ\") to enable the Company to deliver sales under its existing offtake with TransOre International FZE (\"TransOre\").\nTransOre Update\nIn Q3 2023 TransOre entered into an agreement to acquire up to 20,000 tonnes (\"Offtake Agreement\") of washed coal per month. Following an initial sale, Contango has been waiting for TransOre to purchase additional coal under the Offtake Agreement. The Company has been advised by TransOre that it is finalising the appropriate agreements and logistics and hopes to be able to recommence the purchase of Muchesu coal in the near term.\nMulti-National Coking Coal Trial & Potential Offtake\nThe Company is pleased to report that it has entered into an agreement with a leading steel producer (the \"Multi-National\") to supply 1,000 tonnes of washed coking coal for a formal industrial trial during November.\nDiscussions with the Multi-National have been ongoing for the past twelve months, during which time several site visits have taken place and a detailed due diligence process has been undertaken on Muchesu's coal products.\nThe Multi-National has expressed a desire to enter into an offtake with the Company for an initial 80,000 tonnes per annum of washed coking coal from the Muchesu Project, equating to approximately 6,700 tonnes per month, although there is clear potential to expand on this figure as Contango's production capacity increases.\nThe Multi-National has agreed to purchase the washed coking coal for the industrial trial at mine gate, and revenue in excess of US$100K will be paid in advance. The Multi-National will be responsible for transporting the washed coking coal in its own fleet of trucks to its facilities in South Africa where the trial will take place.\nOther Potential Offtakes\nAdditional advanced offtake discussions for both coking coal and industrial coal are also underway with other parties. If successful, it is envisaged that the industrial coal will be purchased at mine gate without the need for washing, therefore increasing production and sales capacity without requiring additional capital investment.\nFinancial Update\nThe Company also notes that it has raised \u00a31 million from existing stakeholders through an unsecured and non-convertible bridging loan for working capital purposes, pending further sales under the TransOre offtake arrangement and a potential new offtake arrangement should the Multi-National's coking coal trial prove successful.\nCarl Esprey, CEO of Contango Holdings commented:\n\"\nMuchesu is fully commissioned and ready to expand operations and we are primed to deliver washed coking coal to the market\n\"We have now entered into a trial supply with one of the largest steel producers globally following their extensive due diligence on the products. As a new coal producer, our coal products are subject to stringent tests and quality control before end users will commit to large volumes, and the Multi-National's interest in our coal is both highly encouraging and reaffirms its quality.\n\"In addition, we have now received a credible approach with respect to our assets. Whilst there is no guarantee a firm offer will be made, we expect this process to move fast and will update shareholders on the details of the proposals as appropriate.\n\"Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to our stakeholders for their continued support during this ramp up phase\n.\"\n**ENDS**\nContango Holdings plc\nChief Executive Officer\nCarl Esprey\nE: contango@stbridespartners.co.uk\nTavira Financial ",

The TransOre Contract is expected to replace the non-exclusive contract with AtoZ Investments (Pty) Ltd previously reported by Contango on 14 June 2022, and is intended to complement the expected offtake arrangements being finalised with the global multi-national company (\"MNC\"), which is expected to complete its due diligence shortly. The TransOre Contract is priced at the prevailing Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (\"MMCZ\") coking coal price, currently at US$120/tonne.\nTransOre will take the coal currently being produced from the upper seams at Muchesu at mine gate at the MMCZ price and handle all logistics and transport costs, through its affiliate African Rail International FZE (\"African Rail Company\"), which has rail access, locomotives and port access for export already in place. TransOre currently holds an allocation for exporting coal through the Dry Bulk Terminal at the Maputo Port, Mozambique. TransOre has also expressed its interest in taking any additional coal that becomes available, either in the event of mine expansion or if the expected contract with the MNC does not materialise.\nOnce steady state production is achieved in Q3 2023 the Company expects its operating costs to be approximately US$45 per tonne of washed coal, although the Company continues to explore additional options to reduce these operating costs further, whilst larger volumes are also expected to bring economies of scale.\nOperational and Financial Update\nAs previously announced, production of washed coking coal commenced at Muchesu on Tuesday 23 May 2023 and a significant stockpile of coking coal has now been mined by the Wirtgen Surface Miner and is awaiting processing. In June issues were encountered with the mobile screen, which was unable to achieve the efficiencies expected. Accordingly, in conjunction with the expectation of entering into a larger offtake arrangement with TransOre, the Company elected to replace it with a larger static screen. Installation is now completed, and the washing of coal will recommence imminently. The Board expects to report first sales under its offtake arrangement with TransOre in August 2023.\nGiven the additional capital requirements, which will enable a larger operation, as well as first sales now expected to be made in August 2023, the Company has raised \u00a31.5M from a number of existing stakeholders through an unsecured and non-convertible bridging loan.\nCarl Esprey, CEO of Contango, commented\n: \"We are delighted to enter into this offtake contract with TransOre, doubling our existing offtake and replacing our non-exclusive offtake with AtoZ. We have been in discussion with TransOre for some time and have been impressed by their operations and network. They bring a sizeable logistics operation, which we believe is more aligned with Contango's objectives moving forward as we develop our world class Muchesu project.\n\"This new contract is in addition to the ongoing discussions under the previously reported MoU with a global Multi-National Company (\"MNC\"). These discussions are centred around a larger coke operation at Muchesu. We expect to deliver further samples of our washed coal to the MNC later this month as part of the final stages of due diligence on the coke qualities of our product.\"\nAlexander Schamber, Chief Commercial Officer of TransOre, commented:\n\"I am pleased our discussions with Contango have reached a positive conclusion and we have entered into an offtake arrangement for up to 20,000 tonnes per month of washed coking and high grade metallurgical coal. TransOre and its affiliate companies are very active throughout southern Africa, and we will be able to leverage our existing infrastructure and logistics experience to ensure efficient delivery of coal from the Muchesu project to our customers. We very much view this as the start of a long term and larger working relationship as we unlock the value of the Muchesu coal project in a collaborative fashion. We are also excited to playing a central role in a project that promises to bring such gre",

Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

Then they'll pay the remainder a few months later, just as they did last year.  2026 should be the year where we finally begin to see some sales taking place, but don't hold your breath folks, as i wouldn't be surprised to hear that sales will be pushed back to 2027,  just so they can mine hundreds of thousands of tons of more free coal, whilst we wait for the profits to trickle down into the share price.  I hope this theory is wrong, but i just have this feeling that they'll kick the can down the road yet again.  But anyway GLA.",

I don't know enough about Esprey's background (and now he has gone don't care) but I would have thought the replacement by a Director of MONAF would have been viewed positively here and may have resulted in some more share purchases. The delay in receipt of the royalty payments in my opinion has likely been linked to slow progress on the definitive agreements with CGO / MONAF / Huo. Hopefully with a Director of MONAF now in charge of CGO this will simplify and expedite the final agreement and the receipt of Royalty payments.",

Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

PGI have also now been registered as operator of the Project.\nThe revised ownership of Monaf, the 100% owner of Muchesu, is now as follows:\nShareholder\nHolding\nPGI\n51.0%\nContango\n24.0%\nLilyone Investments\n6.5%\nLocal Minority Shareholders\n18.5%\nAs previously reported, PGI forms part of the Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong based industrial group with extensive mining and energy operations in Zimbabwe, including a major mine-to-energy industrial park, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant and a nickel smelter. PGI is co-owned by Mr Wencai Huo, the Company's 20.42% shareholder, and Mr Liu Jun.\nThe Mineral Royalty Agreement (\"MRA\") payable by Monaf to Contango remains in effect for the life of mine and includes a US$2 per tonne on thermal coal, US$4 per tonne on industrial coal and US$8 per tonne on coking coal production. A provision within the MRA also ensures a minimum payment to the Company of US$2,000,000 per annum.\nFor further background on the variation please refer to RNS No 3870E dated 22 October 2025 \"Variation to Strategic Partnership for Muchesu\".\nReceipt of US$1,000,000\nThe Company is also pleased to confirm\nthat it has received US$1,000,000 from PGI, marking the first payment received from PGI since it replaced Huo Investments last quarter as the proposed operator, 51% owner of Muchesu and provider of the US$20 million loan facility to the Muchesu project.\nCommenting, Daniel Dos Santos, CEO of Contango, said:\n\"I am pleased to confirm the registration of PGI as a 51% shareholder in Monaf and operator of the Project. In addition, we have also received US$1,000,000 as settlement of the outstanding liability from PGI as part of the variation of terms.\nThe Company will provide a separate operational update shortly.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

No TR1s about their change in holdings since 2022, even though their percentage would have changed after the 140m shares were issued to the Chinese. And where is the FCA exactly to enforce the Disclosure and Transparency Rules? The 30.6m transaction on Friday represents 3.9% of the current issued shares so if its a new major shareholder there should be a TR1. If we don't get a holdings annoucement then that tells us the shareholder, the company and the FCA  don't care about the DTR.",

          "content": "Variation to Strategic Partnership for Muchesu Contango Holdings Plc, a company focused on unlocking value from the +2 billion tonne Muchesu coal project in Zimbabwe (\"Muchesu\"), advises that it has agreed a variation to the previously reported Strategic Partnership with Huo Investments (Pvt) Limited (\"Huo Investments\" or the \"Investor\"). Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

And where is the FCA exactly to enforce the Disclosure and Transparency Rules? The 30.6m transaction on Friday represents 3.9% of the current issued shares so if its a new major shareholder there should be a TR1. If we don't get a holdings annoucement then that tells us the shareholder, the company and the FCA  don't care about the DTR.",

I hope this theory is wrong, but i just have this feeling that they'll kick the can down the road yet again.  But anyway GLA.",

          "content": "Variation to Strategic Partnership for Muchesu Contango Holdings Plc, a company focused on unlocking value from the +2 billion tonne Muchesu coal project in Zimbabwe (\"Muchesu\"), advises that it has agreed a variation to the previously reported Strategic Partnership with Huo Investments (Pvt) Limited (\"Huo Investments\" or the \"Investor\"). Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

The 30.6m transaction on Friday represents 3.9% of the current issued shares so if its a new major shareholder there should be a TR1.

          "content": "Variation to Strategic Partnership for Muchesu Contango Holdings Plc, a company focused on unlocking value from the +2 billion tonne Muchesu coal project in Zimbabwe (\"Muchesu\"), advises that it has agreed a variation to the previously reported Strategic Partnership with Huo Investments (Pvt) Limited (\"Huo Investments\" or the \"Investor\"). Background As announced on 3 July 2024, Contango entered into binding agreements with the Investor, which together comprised a purchase of a 51% equity interest in Muchesu, a US$2 million Subscription into the Company, a Mineral Royalty Agreement, and a US$20 million Revolving Facility Agreement (together, the \"Definitive Agreements\"). During 2024 and 2025, the Investor has advanced material funding under the Revolving Facility Agreement for the following: \u00b7 Expansion of the mining footprint of Muchesu; \u00b7 Installation of a large Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") plant; \u00b7 Substantial infrastructure works; and \u00b7 Installation of coke batteries and associated value-enhancing infrastructure. Further operational detail and expenditure will be provided shortly in a separate update. With the Subscription completed in Q1 2025, Huo Investments became the Company's largest shareholder with a holding of 20.42%. Royalty payments commenced in 2025 in accordance with the Mineral Royalty Agreement, with US$1,000,000 paid during H1 2025 and a further US$1,000,000 scheduled for payment this quarter as set out in the Mineral Royalty Agreement. Variation to the Definitive Agreements Asset-Level Purchase Muchesu is held by the Company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe being Monaf Investments (Private) Limited (\"Monaf\"). The Definitive Agreements originally envisaged that the Investor would purchase a 51% equity interest in Muchesu (via Monaf). This will now be undertaken by Pacific Goal Investments Private Limited (\"PGI\"), a Zimbabwe-focused investment vehicle equally owned by Mr Wencai Huo (the principal of Huo Investments) and Mr Liu Jun. Definitive documentation has been executed to reflect this change and is currently being registered with the Central Bank in Zimbabwe. PGI forms part of Pacific Goal Group, a Hong Kong-based industrial group with extensive operations in Zimbabwe. The group is currently developing a major mine-to-energy industrial park in the country, incorporating two power stations, a graphite processing plant, and a nickel smelter. PGI also operates a logistics fleet of more than 200 trucks, as well as holding interests in other mining and power-related developments in Zimbabwe. This extensive operational presence and expertise is expected to prove complimentary to delivering value from the Muchesu project. The purchase of 6.502% of shares in Monaf as announced on 12 March 2025, is unaffected. These shares are now held through Lilyone Investments, a wholly owned investment company of Mr Wencai Huo.",

And where is the FCA exactly to enforce the Disclosure and Transparency Rules? The 30.6m transaction on Friday represents 3.9% of the current issued shares so if its a new major shareholder there should be a TR1.

They could export so much more, but because of the state of the transport system then it would prove to be too uncompetetive. They need some serious improvements as you can imagine how dilapidated the railway systems are in Zimbabwe.",
