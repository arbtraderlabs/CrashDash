Each Unit is comprised of one common share of nil par value (\"Galantas Share\") and one Galantas Share purchase warrant (each, a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share at a price of $0.12 for a period of 36 months from the date hereof.\nMario Stifano, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, participated in the Brokered Offering for 400,000 Units, purchasing these Units at the Offering Price for a total consideration of $32,000 (the \"Stifano Participation\"). George Duguay, an officer of the Company, also participated in the Brokered Offering for 500,000 Units at the Offering Price for a total consideration of $40,000.\nMr Stifano is deemed a related party to the Company for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies, and the Stifano Participation is considered a related-party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Accordingly, the Stifano Participation should have been evaluated and announced as a Related Party Transaction under AIM Rule 13 at the time.\nIn accordance with AIM Rule 13, the Directors of the Company, excluding Mr Stifano, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, consider that, at the time it was entered into, the terms of the Stifano Participation were fair and reasonable, insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nHistoric PDMR Share Dealings\nOn June 25, 2021, the Company announced that Mr Stifano had on June 23, 2021, purchased 500 Galantas Shares at an average price of C$0.73. The number of Galantas Shares purchased was incorrectly disclosed and should have been 800 Galantas Shares. The Company received notification on January 20, 2026, that on November 25, 2022, Mr Stifano sold 1,375 Galantas Shares at an average price of $0.53.\nFollowing the Stifano Participation\nand the aforementioned disclosures\n, Mr Stifano holds 641,278 Galantas Shares, representing approximately 0.14% of the Company's issued share capital.\nAbout Galantas Gold Corporation\nGalantas Gold Corporation is a publicly traded gold company focused on the acquisition, development, and advancement of gold assets in stable mining jurisdictions. The Company is currently advancing the Indiana Gold-Copper Project in Chile, an advanced-stage project with a substantial historical resource base.

The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. The acquisition represents a significant strategic step for Galantas and is expected to constitute a\u00a0Fundamental Acquisition\u00a0under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (\"\nTSXV\n\").\nAndacollo Oro Gold Project Overview\nThe Project is located in the Coquimbo Region, Chile, approximately 55 kilometres southeast of the coastal city of La Serena, at a low elevation of 1,100 metres. The Project includes a\nsubstantial permitted footprint with\u00a0mining concessions, land title, and water rights\u00a0in place. Extensive earthworks, mine infrastructure, and three leach pads remain on site with excellent access to infrastructure, services, and a skilled workforce.\nA\nhistorical mineral resource estimate(1)(2) for the Project estimates its measured and indicated mineral resources at an aggregate of 2.02 million (M) ounces (oz) of gold (Au), consisting of 130M tonnes (t) at 0.48 Au grams per tonne\n(g/t) and estimates its inferred mineral resources at\n5.06M oz Au, consisting of 358Mt at 0.45 Au g/t\n.\nThe historical mineral resource estimate\u00a0is derived from the\u00a0National Instrument 43-101\nStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\n(\"\nNI 43-101\n\") technical report titled \"\nCMID SPA, Andacollo Oro, Chile, Technical Report\"\nprepared by GEOINVEST SAC E.I.R.L. Chile, with an effective date of August 23, 2021 (the \"\nHistorical Report\n\").\nThe Historical Report states that the Project operated as a\u00a020,000 tonne per day (tpd) open pit heap leach operation, producing a cumulative\u00a01.12M oz Au between 1998 and 2018, with peak annual production of approximately\u00a0135,000 oz Au.\nGeologically, the Project hosts a\u00a0low-sulphidation epithermal, manto-style gold system. The deposit has been extensively evaluated by past operators, with\u00a01,600 drill holes completed for a total of approximately 190,000 metres, providing a robust technical database underpinning multiple historical studies and resource estimates.\nThe Project is adjacent to the producing Carmen del Andacollo porphyry copper mine (the \"\nCDA Mine\n\"), operated by Teck Resources Limited (\"\nTeck\n\"), which produces about 45,000 tonnes of copper per year. See \"Adjacent Property Disclosure\" below.\nMario Stifano, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented:\n\"This transaction represents a clear step-change in the scale and profile of Galantas. The acquisition of the Andacollo Oro Gold Project fundamentally repositions the Company, adding a large-scale, past-producing gold asset with existing infrastructure, permits, and a deep technical database in one of Chile's most established mining districts.\nWith an Adsorption-Desorption-Recovery plant at 200,000 oz per annum nameplate capacity, the Project provides Galantas with multiple development pathways and a level of optionality that is rarely available in a single transaction, while the staged consideration structure reflects our commitment to capital discipline and risk management. The Project has significant exploration potential for both additional gold and copper mineralization.\nImportantly, this acquisition complements our ongoing work at the Indiana Gold-Copper Project, where a Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway and drilling is planned for the first quarter of 2026. Together, these assets mark an evolution of Galantas from a single-asset company into a multi-asset platform, positioning the Company for disciplined growth and long-term value creation.\"\nTransaction Structure and Related-Party Disclosure\nThe Transaction will be effected by way of the Agreement, pursuant to which Galantas will acquire\u00a0100% of the shares of Sol de Oro Mining Ltd. (\"\nSol\n\"), which in turn owns\u00a0100% of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera OXI SpA (\"\nOXI\n\"). OXI has purchased 100% of the shares of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera e Inmobiliaria Dragones SpA (\"\nDragones\n\"), the owner of the Project, pursuant to certain share purchase agreements dated January 6, 2026 with the former Dragones shareholders (the \"\nDragones Agreements\n\"). All former Dragones shareholders are arm's length to OXI, Sol and Galantas. If the payments described below are not completed to the former Dragones shareholders, such shares will be transferred back to the former shareholders with any partial payments forfeited. Sol and OXI were established as dedicated transaction vehicles to consolidate ownership and facilitate the acquisition of the Project.\nA summary of Sol's financial information on a consolidated basis (which includes both OXI and Dragones) as at and for the year ended December 31, 2025, is as follows:\nTotal (US$)\nTotal (GBP)\nTotal Assets\n4,275,908\n3,168,918\nTotal Liabilities\n4,343,429\n3,218,958\nRevenue\n-\n-\nProfit / (Losses)\n(67,521)\n(50,040)\nSol is owned 100% by Robert Sedgemore, who is an executive officer of Galantas and is a Non-Arm's Length Party as defined in the TSXV policies in relation to Galantas. As a result, the Transaction constitutes a\u00a0\"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101\nProtection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions\n(\"\nMI 61-101\n\") and TSXV policies. The terms of the Transaction were negotiated on a commercial basis. In considering the Transaction, the board of directors of Galantas reviewed the Project's historical production performance, technical information, jurisdictional profile, and comparable transaction metrics, and determined that the Transaction is\u00a0in the best interests of the Company. The Company relied on exemptions from the formal valuation of MI 61-101 as no securities of the Company are listed or quoted on certain specified exchanges. The Transaction has received\u00a0full board approval\u00a0and will be subject to all required regulatory approvals, including minority approval requirements of MI 61-101. No finder fees were paid in relation to the Transaction.\nRobert Sedgemore is deemed a related party to the Company for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies, and the Sol Payment (as defined below) is considered a related-party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Accordingly, the directors of the Company, who are all considered independent of the Sol Payment, having consulted with their Nominated Adviser, consider the terms of the Sol Payment to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nConsideration and Payment Terms\nSubject to TSXV approval, the total\u00a0cash consideration\u00a0payable under the Agreement and the Dragones Agreements is\u00a0US$32.0 million, structured as staged payments over four years to align with development planning and capital discipline.\nThe cash consideration is payable as follows:\n\u00b7\nOn closing of the Transaction (the \"\nClosing\n\"):\u00a0US$4.5 million, comprised of:\no\nthe assumption of debts held by OXI and Sol, which is approximately US$3.0 million; and\no\nUS$1.5 million payable to the Sol shareholder, Robert Sedgemore, as consideration for 100% of the shares of Sol (the \"\nSol Payment\n\").\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2026:\u00a0US$3.5 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2027:\u00a0US$4.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2028:\u00a0US$6.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2029:\u00a0US$14.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\nIn addition to the cash consideration, on Closing,\u00a0Luis Catril, the controlling shareholder of Dragones, will receive\u00a091,313,890 common shares of Galantas (representing 19.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Galantas as of January 6, 2026), subject to TSXV approval and Galantas shareholder approval, excluding Robert Sedgemore as a connected party to the Transaction.\nThe common shares to be issued to Mr. Catril will be issued at a\u00a0deemed price equal to the market price of the Company's shares in accordance with TSXV policies\u00a0and are expected to be subject to\u00a0applicable resale restrictions and escrow requirements, if any, as determined by the TSXV.\nThe Company expects to fund the cash consideration from a combination of future financing and/or working capital.\nK2 Resources Inc. (\"\nK2\n\") and ExGen Resources Inc. (\"\nExGen\n\") hold silver streams on the Property, each requiring delivery of 33.4% and 66.6%, respectively, of each payable ounce of silver produced at the Property to K2 and ExGen until the payment of 333,334 ounces of silver to K2 and 666,667 of silver to ExGen is complete, and after which 16.7% and 33.3%, respectively, of each ounce of payable silver produced at the Property will be delivered to each of K2 and ExGen.\nFurther information on the Project\nThe Project represents a rare opportunity to acquire a\u00a0large-scale, brownfield gold asset\u00a0with a long operating history,\u00a0existing infrastructure, and a\u00a0fully permitted footprint\u00a0in a stable and well-established mining jurisdiction. Unlike greenfield projects, the Project benefits from historical mine development, processing facilities, and infrastructure already in place, materially reducing development complexity and capital costs.\nThe Project is a\u00a0past-producing open pit heap leach operation with proven metallurgy, having historically operated at commercial scale for more than two decades. The Project has been non-operational since 2015. Mining methods, metallurgical performance, and processing routes are well understood based on extensive historical operating data, significantly reducing technical uncertainty relative to earlier-stage assets.\nThe Project hosts a historical mineral resource base, supported by a large drilling database and multiple historical technical studies. In addition, significant mineralized material remains on site, including material placed on existing leach pads, providing a tangible foundation for staged evaluation and development activities.\nFrom a development perspective, the combination of\u00a0existing infrastructure, valid permits, historical production, historical mineral resource estimates, and proven processing methods\u00a0provides a clear pathway to evaluate opportunities to\u00a0advance the Project on an accelerated timeline toward potential production, subject to completion of updated technical studies and regulatory approvals.\nHistorical Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates(1)(2)\nThe following\u00a0historical mineral resource estimate is derived from the Historical Report.\nClassification\nTonnes (Mt)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nContained Gold (Moz Au)\nMeasured + Indicated\n130.0\n0.48\n2.02\nInferred\n358.0\n0.45\n5.06\nTotal\n488.0\n0.46\n7.08\nThe Historical Report also identifies the following historical mineral reserve estimate, contained within the measured and indicated mineral resources:\nClassification\nTonnes (Mt)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nContained Gold (Moz Au)\nProbable\n40.74\n0.64\n0.83\nNotes:\n1\nThe Company considers the historical estimates to be relevant as they provide an indication of the potential of the Project. However, a qualified person of Galantas has not done sufficient work to classify these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and Galantas is not treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Galantas has not verified this information and is not relying on it. To verify the historical mineral resource estimate, Galantas will need to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate and NI 43-101 technical report with respect to the Project (the \"\nNew Report\n\"). Galantas is currently preparing the New Report and intends to file it on SEDAR+ upon the completion of the Transaction in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and applicable securities laws.\n2 The historical mineral resource estimate considers resources optimized in a global open-pit shell using a gold price of US$1,750 per oz Au, and a cut-off grade of 0.15 g/t Au. The historical mineral reserve estimate was based on a gold price of US$1,550 per oz Au, and a cut-off grade of 0.20 g/t Au.\nExploration Opportunities\nThe Project has significant exploration upside, as noted in the Historical Report. Drilling to date has been mostly vertical, leading to opportunities for grade enhancement by angle-drilling vertical and near-vertical higher-grade feeder structures. There is significant potential to increase resources by exploration along strike and down-dip of known mineralization. Additionally, there is a possibility of porphyry-style gold-copper mineralization extending from Teck's adjacent CDA Mine onto the Project with drilling in 2011 between the Project and CDA Mine pits returning up to 30 metres of 0.53% copper. However, this is not guaranteed. See \"Adjacent Property Disclosure\" below.\nThere are also indications of a chalcocite enriched copper blanket in the transition zone between oxide and sulfide at the Project, which would represent a high-grade copper target in its own right. Finally, there are numerous gold-copper occurrences on the Project which have not been adequately explored and evaluated, as well as similar occurrences and operating small-scale mines on adjacent ground.\nAdjacent Property Disclosure\nAs discussed in this news release, the Project is located adjacent to the CDA Mine operated by Teck. The Company does not hold, and has no right to acquire, any interest in the CDA Mine. Mineralization and production on adjacent or nearby properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization or future production, costs, or economic results at the Project. Information in relation Teck has been sourced from www.teck.com.\nConditions to Closing\nCompletion of the Transaction is subject to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nTSXV approval, including approval of the Transaction as a\u00a0Fundamental Acquisition.\n\u00b7\nSatisfaction of all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\u00b7\nReceipt of required shareholder approvals, including minority approval requirements of MI 61-101.\n\u00b7\nCompletion of customary closing conditions.\nApproval of Board of Directors for the Agreement\nAfter consultation with its legal advisors, the board of directors of Galantas unanimously approved the entering into of the Agreement.\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical disclosures in this news release have been reviewed and approved by\u00a0Mr. Gavin Berkenheger, who is considered, by virtue of his education, experience, and professional association, to be a\u00a0Qualified Person\u00a0and\u00a0independent\u00a0for the purposes of\u00a0NI 43-101.\nNeither the TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nThe information contained in this announcement is deemed to constitute\u00a0inside information\u00a0as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the\u00a0Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\u00a0(the \"\nUK MAR\n\"), which forms part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Highlights from the Technical Report include:\n\u2022 4.93 million tonnes (t) grading 2.24 g/t gold (Au) and 1.31% copper (Cu), containing inferred mineral resources of 355,516 ounces (oz) Au and 64,690 t Cu (in situ)\n\u2022 Mine design and Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"\nPEA\n\") workstreams initiated\n\u2022 Mineral resource definition and geotechnical drilling planned to support underground mine design and stope optimization\n\u2022 Halo mineralization not included in the current Technical Report; planned for incorporation into the PEA mine model and future mineral resource update\n\u2022 Commercial off-take agreement executed with Ocean Partners for copper-gold concentrate\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"The completion of the updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate for the Indiana Project (as defined below) represents an important technical milestone for the Company. The quality, grade profile and continuity of the vein systems, together with the scale of the in-vein resource, provide a solid foundation as we advance mine design and commence the PEA. With financing closed and a commercial off-take partner secured, we are well positioned to systematically advance the project while continuing to evaluate opportunities to enhance value through drilling to explore at least 21 untested veins.\"\nCompletion of the Transaction\nThe acquisition of RDL provides Galantas with an option (the \"\nOption\n\") to acquire a 100% interest in the Indiana gold/copper project located in Chile (the \"\nIndiana Project\n\"), by meeting certain conditions, pursuant to an option agreement between Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera RDL SpA (\"\nRDL SpA\n\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RDL, and Miner\u00eda Indiana Limitada dated October 30, 2025. Additional details of the Option are included in Galantas' press releases dated November 13, 2025, November 21, 2025, and December 19, 2025.\nAs consideration under the Transaction, each RDL Shareholder received approximately 44 million Galantas Shares, for an aggregate of approximately 132 million Galantas Shares. Each RDL Shareholder holds Galantas Shares representing approximately 10% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares following the completion of the Transaction and the Offerings. As additional consideration under the Transaction, each RDL Shareholder was granted a 0.66% net smelter return (\"\nNSR\n\") royalty payable by Galantas in respect of the Indiana Project, for an aggregate NSR royalty of approximately 2.0%.\nIn connection with the Transaction, Lawrence Roulston was appointed to the board of directors of Galantas (the \"\nGalantas Board\n\"). The Galantas Board is now comprised of six members, being Mario Stifano, R\u00f3is\u00edn Magee, James Clancy, David Cather, Brent Omland (existing directors of Galantas) and Lawrence Roulston (a new director and a former RDL Shareholder). In addition, Robert Sedgemore was appointed as Senior Vice President, Operations, of Galantas.\nCompletion of the Offerings\nThe Company completed the Brokered Offering of 186,250,000 Units for aggregate gross proceeds of $14,900,000. Each Unit is comprised of one Galantas Share and one Galantas Share purchase warrant (each, a \"\nWarrant\n\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share at a price of $0.12 for a period of 36 months from the date hereof.\nAs compensation for their services, the Company: (i) paid to the Agents a cash commission of $1,042,750 representing 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offerings (including gross proceeds from the Agents' over-allotment option), reduced to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of $1,100,000 from certain purchasers\non the president's list agreed to between the Company and Canaccord Genuity\nCorp. (the \"\nPresident's List\n\"), and (ii) issued to the Agents 13,034,375 compensation warrants (\"\nCompensation Warrants\n\"), representing 7.0% of the Units and Shares, as applicable, sold in the Offerings (including Units sold pursuant to the Agents' over-allotment option), reduced to 3.0% for purchasers on the President's List. Each Compensation Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share for the Offering Price for a period of 24 months from the date hereof.\nA separate cash finder's fee of $77,000.00 was paid to Harbourfront Wealth Management Inc., representing 7.0% of the gross proceeds from investors introduced to the Company by Harbourfront Wealth Management Inc. as consideration for finding and introducing such investors to the Company.\nThe net proceeds from the Offerings will be used to fund exploration work on the Indiana Project, to fund payments in connection with the Option for the Indiana Project, and for general corporate and working capital purposes.\nCertain \"Insiders\" of the Company (as such term is defined under the policies of the TSXV) purchased an aggregate of 10,900,000 Units in the Offerings, which is considered a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101\nProtection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions\n(\"\nMI\n61-101\n\"). The Company relied on the exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 based on a determination that the fair market value of the Offerings, insofar as it involves the Insiders, does not exceed 25% of the market capitalization of the Company.\nOcean Partners participated in the Brokered Offering for 35,937,500 Units and in the Non-Brokered Offering for 7,812,500 Shares resulting in Ocean Partners becoming an Insider of the Company. Eric Sprott (through 2176423 Ontario Ltd.) participated in the Brokered Offering for 50,000,000 Units becoming an Insider of the Company. Following the completion of the Transaction and the Offerings, Ocean Partners and Eric Sprott held approximately 10.7% and 13.1% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares, respectively.\nNo new \"Control Persons\" (as such term is defined under the policies of the TSXV) were created in connection with the Offerings. In addition, the Warrants restrict any holder from exercising any Warrants that would result in any holder owning or controlling 20% or more of the then issued and outstanding Galantas Shares (calculated on a partially diluted basis).\nThe securities offered have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nAny securities issued under the Offerings will be subject to a hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, expiring four months and one day following the date hereof.\nUpdated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate - Indiana Project\nThe updated mineral resource estimate contained in the Technical Report (titled \"\nMineral Resource Estimate, Indiana Project, Atacama Region, Chile\n\" with an effective date of December 9, 2025 and prepared by DRA in accordance with NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards) and is reported on an in-vein basis across seven principal vein systems. Mineral resources are constrained by reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction and reported using gold equivalent (AuEq) cut-off grades of 0.99 g/t AuEq for sulphide material and 0.95 g/t AuEq for oxide material.\nTable 1 - 2025 Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (Indiana Project - December 9, 2025)\nCategory\nTonnes (000s)\nAu (g/t)\nCu (%)\nContained Au (oz)\nContained Cu (t)\nInferred\n4,932\n2.24\n1.31\n355,516\n64,690\nNotes:\n1. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves.\n2. AuEq cut-offs are based on assumed gold price of US$3,200/oz and copper price of US$4.70/lb, with metallurgical recoveries and operating cost assumptions detailed in the Technical Report.\n3. There are no known legal, political, environmental or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources.\n4. Numbers may not add due to rounding.\nResource Upside and Mine Model Refinement\nDRA notes that the 2025 mineral resource estimate is restricted to in-vein mineralization only and does not include mineralized halos surrounding the veins. The presence and continuity of halo mineralization have been validated by historical drilling and underground sampling; however, this material has not been incorporated into the current estimate as the updated geological and block modelling for halo domains has not yet been completed.\nDRA further notes that inclusion of halo material in future resource updates, subject to completion of the updated geological modelling, appropriate drilling density and engineering validation, may result in changes to tonnage and mine planning assumptions and provide additional mine planning flexibility.\nThe Company intends to incorporate halo mineralization into the updated geological and mine model currently being developed as part of the PEA, subject to validation through additional drilling, geological interpretation and engineering analysis.\nThe Technical Report will be filed by the Company on SEDAR+ on the date of this news release and is available to view below.\nClick on, or paste the following link into your web browser, to view the associated PDF document.\nhttps://galantas.com/site/assets/files/8836/technical_report.pdf\nProject Advancement: Mine Design and Off-Take\nGalantas intends to commence formal mine design activities and preparation of the PEA.\nPlanned work programs include resource definition drilling and geotechnical drilling designed to support underground mine design, stope geometry, ground support assumptions and infrastructure layout, together with mine engineering, scheduling and cost estimation activities required to support the PEA. The PEA will include an evaluation of mining methods, processing options, infrastructure, capital and operating cost estimates, and economic sensitivities, subject to the limitations inherent in a preliminary-level study. These activities are intended to evaluate the technical and economic parameters of a potential mining operation and do not constitute a production decision.\nRDL, through its Chilean subsidiary, RDL SpA, has also executed a concentrate off-take agreement with a subsidiary of Ocean Partners, pursuant to which Ocean Partners, through its subsidiary, has agreed to purchase copper-gold concentrate produced from the Indiana Project under market-based treatment, refining and payable metal terms (the \"\nOfftake Agreement\n\"). The Offtake Agreement is intended to support future project development and does not constitute a production decision.\nDisclosure required pursuant to Rule 17 and Schedule 2(g) of the AIM Rules for Companies\nThe names of all companies and partnerships of which Lawrence Roulsten, aged 73, has been a director or partner at any time in the previous \ufb01ve years are set out below:\nCurrent\nPast\nMetalla Royalty and Streaming Ltd\nMTB Metals Corp\nMta Royalty & Streaming Pty Ltd\nThunderstruck Resources Ltd\nGT Resources\nSilver Hammer Mining Corp\nEnduro Metals Corp\nMr. Roulston became a director of KBL Mining Ltd.

(\"\nRDL\n\") and its previously announced private placement (the \"\nOffering\n\") of units of the Company (each, a \"\nUnit\n\"), for $0.08 per Unit (the \"\nOffering Price\n\"), led by Canaccord Genuity Corp. and Haywood Securities Inc. (together, the \"\nAgents\n\").\nThe Company is working diligently to satisfy remaining closing conditions, including obtaining approval of the Transaction from the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"\nTSXV\n\"), and both the Offering and the Transaction are expected to be completed during 2025. Trading in the common shares of Galantas (\"\nCommon Shares\n\") is currently halted in accordance with TSXV Policy 5.3.\nClarification of the RDL Option\nOnce the Transaction is completed, Galantas (indirectly through RDL) will hold an option (the \"\nOption\n\") to acquire a 100% interest in the Indiana gold/copper project located in Chile (the \"\nIndiana Project\n\"). In order to exercise the Option, RDL must make payments totaling US$15 million to Miner\u00eda Indiana Limitada (\"\nIndiana Limitada\n\"), the current owner of the Indiana Project, over a period of five years, with the first payment of US$500,000 paid in the fourth quarter of 2025. The remaining payments consist of US$1 million in years one and two, US$2 million in years three and four and a final payment of US$8.5 million in year five (together, the \"\nOption Payments\n\").\nUntil RDL has exercised the Option, RDL will \"lease\" the Indiana Project from Indiana Limitada in exchange for payments as follows:\n\u00b7\nIf the Indiana Project is in production, the monthly payment is equivalent to 10% of the net sales of minerals from the mining concessions.\n\u00b7\nIf the Indiana Project is not in production, the monthly payment based on net sales will not be paid, and the minimum payment below will be paid.\n\u00b7\nOn an annual basis, the minimum payment required is 25% of the Option Payment due for that year, and the maximum payment required is 50% of the Option Payment due for that year.\n\u00b7\nIf the Indiana Project is not in production, minimum payments will still be payable on an annual basis. As soon as the Option Payments are paid in full, RDL will no longer need to make any lease payments.\nSuch payments are made in exchange for access to the Indiana Project and are not credited as Option Payments.\nHistorical Mineral Resources\nThe Company would like to clarify and restate certain technical information previously provided in respect of the 2013 Technical Report (as defined below), which was included in the Company's press release dated November 13, 2025. See below for the corrected information.\nA historical inferred mineral resource estimate for the Indiana Project1 outlines approximately 714,600 ounces of gold equivalent (AuEq)2, consisting of approximately 4,546,300 tonnes, averaging 4.89 parts per million (ppm) AuEq, supported by a technical report (the \"\n2013 Technical Report\n\") prepared for Minera Activa SpA in accordance with National Instrument 43-101\nStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\n(\"\nNI 43-101\n\").\nThe historical inferred mineral resource estimate2 for the Indiana Project is contained in the table

Company considers the historical estimate to be relevant as it provides an indication of the mineral potential of the Indiana Project. However, a qualified person of Galantas has not done sufficient work to classify this historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and Galantas is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Galantas has not verified this information and is not relying on it. To verify the historical estimate, Galantas will need to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate and NI 43-101 technical report with respect to the Indiana Project (the \"\nNew Technical Report\n\"). Galantas is currently preparing the New Technical Report and intends to file it on SEDAR+ upon the completion of the Transaction in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and applicable securities laws.\nSince the date of the 2013 Technical Report, additional exploration has been conducted on the Indiana Project. Approximately 1,500 meters of exploitation and exploration drifts have been excavated, mapped and sampled. In addition, approximately 960 meters of core was drilled in 2020.\nOffering Update\nThe Company intends to rely on the \"part and parcel pricing exception\" provided for in the corporate finance policies of the TSXV in relation to gross proceeds raised that are specifically allocated and necessary for the Transaction, being $10 million (the \"\nTransaction Funds\n\"). The Offering Price for any non-Transaction Funds raised under the Offering may need to be adjusted after the Common Shares resume trading, and therefore closing of the Offering relating to any non-Transaction Funds will occur at least two business days after the Common Shares resume trading. Any adjustments to all or a portion of the Offering will require the approval of the TSXV and will be announced via a subsequent press release.\nThe securities offered under the Offering have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nNotes\n[1]\n\"\nTechnical Report Indiana Gold and Copper Project Region III Chile\n\" dated December 9, 2013, prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 by Dr. Eduardo Magri for Activa.\n2\nGold equivalency based on the following prices: gold US$1,100/oz, copper US$2.80/lb, molybdenum US$12/lb, and adjusted for the following recovery rates: gold 75%, copper 88%, molybdenum 60% (\ne.g.\n, 1 pound copper = (1 x $2.80) / $1,100 x (88% / 75%) AuEq). Areas, tonnages and metal content are rounded to the nearest hundred square metres, tonnes and ounces, respectively; vein thickness is rounded to the nearest centimetre, grades are rounded to two decimal places. Rounding may result in apparent differences between tonnes, grade and metal content. Inferred mineral resources were estimated as a global inferred geological resource using a vein accumulation methodology base on true widths, with grades estimated using Sichel't estimation due to limited data density. No cut-off grade was applied to the inferred mineral resource estimate.\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical disclosures in this news release have been reviewed and approved by Mr. Gavin Berkenheger, who is considered, by virtue of his education, experience and professional association, a \"qualified person\" and independent under the terms of NI 43-101.\nNeither TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"\nUK MAR\n\") which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Dollars)\n(Unaudited)\n1.\nIncorporation and Nature of Operations\nGalantas Gold Corporation (the \"Company\") was formed on September 20, 1996 under the name Montemor Resources Inc. on the amalgamation of 1169479 Ontario Inc. and Consolidated Deer Creek Resources Limited. The name was changed to European Gold Resources Inc. by articles of amendment dated July 25, 1997. On May 5, 2004, the Company changed its name from European Gold Resources Inc. to Galantas Gold Corporation. The Company was incorporated to explore for and develop mineral resource properties, principally in Europe. In 1997, it purchased all of the shares of Omagh Minerals Limited (\"Omagh\") which owns a mineral property in Northern Ireland, including a delineated gold deposit. Omagh obtained full planning and environmental consents necessary to bring its property into production.\nThe Company entered into an agreement on April 17, 2000, approved by shareholders on June 26, 2000, whereby Cavanacaw Corporation (\"Cavanacaw\"), a private Ontario corporation, acquired Omagh. Cavanacaw has established an open pit mine to extract the Company's gold deposit near Omagh, Northern Ireland. Cavanacaw also has developed a premium jewellery business founded on the gold produced under the name Gal\u00e1ntas Irish Gold Limited (\"Gal\u00e1ntas\"). As at July 1, 2007, the Company's Omagh mine began production and in 2013 production was suspended. On April 1, 2014, Gal\u00e1ntas amalgamated its jewelry business with Omagh.\nOn April 8, 2014, Cavanacaw acquired Flintridge Resources Limited (\"Flintridge\"). Following a strategic review of its business by the Company during 2014 certain assets owned by Omagh were acquired by Flintridge.\nOn November 16, 2023, Gairloch Resources Limited (\"Gairloch\") was incorporated.\nOn September 23, 2025, the Company sold 80% interest in Flintridge and 80% in Omagh, subsidiaries of Galantas which together own the Omagh Project (the \"Transaction\"). The remaining 20% interest in Flintridge and 20% interest in Omagh will be retained by Galantas. Refer to note 6.\nThe Company's operations include the consolidated results of Gairloch, Cavanacaw, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Omagh, Gal\u00e1ntas and Flintridge. For Omagh and Flintridge the results are included up to the September 23, 2025 (date of loss of control).\nThe Company's common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (\"TSXV\") and London Stock Exchange AIM under the symbol GAL. On September 1, 2021, the Company's common shares started trading under the symbol GALKF on the OTCQX in the United States. The primary office is located at The Canadian Venture Building, 82 Richmond Street East, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5C 1P1.\n2.\nGoing Concern\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but is not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period. Management is aware, in making its assessment, of uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's future viability depends on the consolidated results of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries Gairloch which incorporated on November 16, 2023 and Cavanacaw. Cavanacaw had a 100% shareholding in Gal\u00e1ntas, Flintridge who are engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of gold properties, mainly in Omagh, Northern Ireland and Omagh who is engaged in the exploration of gold properties, mainly in the Republic of Ireland. The Omagh mine is an open pit mine, which was in production until 2013 when production was suspended and is reported as property, plant and equipment and as an underground mine which having established technical feasibility and commercial viability in December 2018 has resulted in associated exploration and evaluation assets being reclassified as an intangible development asset and reported as property, plant and equipment. On September 23, 2025, Cavanacaw lost control of Flintridge and Omagh (refer to note 6).\nThe going concern assumption is dependent on forecast cash flows being met, further financing negotiations being completed successfully. Management' assumptions in relation to future financing, levels of production, gold prices and mine operating costs are crucial to forecast cash flows being achieved. Should production be significantly delayed, revenues fall short of expectations or operating costs and capital costs increase significantly, there may be insufficient cash flows to sustain day to day operations without seeking further financing.\nBased on the financial projections which have been prepared for a five-year period and using assumptions which management believes to be prudent, alongside ongoing negotiations with both current and prospective investors and creditors, management believes it is appropriate to prepare the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis.\nShould the Company be unsuccessful in securing the above, there would be significant uncertainty over the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if forecast cash flows were not achieved, if the existing creditors withdrew their support or if further financing could not be raised from current or potential investors.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company raised gross proceeds of $1.1M through loans from related parties.\nAs at September 30, 2025, the Company had a deficit of $87,460,832 (December 31, 2024 - $80,520,994). Comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $8,764,497 (nine months ended September 30, 2024 - $1,849,549). These conditions raise material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt as to whether the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. However, management believes that it will continue as a going concern. However, this is subject to a number of uncertainties detailed above. These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not reflect adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and financial position classifications used that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could be material.\n3.\nBasis of Preparation and Material Accounting Policies\nStatement of compliance\nThe Company applies IFRS\u00ae Accounting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\"). These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements.\nThe policies applied in these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements are based on IFRS issued and outstanding as of November 27, 2025 the date the Board of Directors approved the statements. The same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements as compared with the most recent annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2024, except as noted below. Any subsequent changes to IFRS that are given effect in the Company's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2025 could result in restatement of these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment in associate\nThe Company's investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and its share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from the associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\nWhen the Company's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables from the associate, the Company does not recognize further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or the Company is contractually required to fund these additional losses.\nThe carrying amount of the investment in associate is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, the carrying amount of the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\nUnrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Company and an associate are eliminated to the extent of the Company's interest in the associate.\nThe Company's share of its associate's post-acquisition results is shown on the face of the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive (loss) income, and its share of movements in reserves is recognized directly in equity.\n4.\nAccounts Receivable and Prepaid Expenses\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nSales tax receivable - Canada\n$\n13,870\n$\n13,225\nValued added tax receivable - Northern Ireland\n-\n61,414\nAccounts receivable\n-\n69,806\nPrepaid expenses\n175,662\n219,917\n$\n189,532\n$\n364,362\nPrepaid expenses includes advances for consumables and for construction of the passing bays in the Omagh mine. Prepaid expenses includes also $166,667 (December 31, 2024 - $111,111) pursuant to services agreement for the underground development at the Omagh Gold Project. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, prepaid expenses were written-up by $nil and $55,556, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\u00a0- $nil) to reflect anticipated value of associated services to be received in future. The following is an aged analysis of receivables:\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nLess than 3 months\n$\n13,870\n$\n101,263\n3 to 12 months\n-\n20,173\nMore than 12 months\n-\n23,009\nTotal accounts receivable\n$\n13,870\n$\n144,445\n5.\u00a0Inventories\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nConcentrate inventories\n$\n-\n$\n213,644\n6.\nInvestment in associates\nOn September 23, 2025, Ocean Partners UK Ltd. (\"Ocean Partners\") completed the exchange of its existing loans, totalling approximately US$14 million ($19.7 million), for an 80% interest in Flintridge and Omagh, subsidiaries of Galantas that collectively own the Omagh Project. As a result, Galantas retains a 20% interest in each subsidiary.\nAs part of the transaction, Ocean Partners has provided an initial capital investment of US$3 million ($4,176,300). These funds are allocated toward exploration, restart planning, and general and administrative costs during the first phase of the joint venture, referred to as the Initial Term. Galantas is free carried during this period. Ocean Partners has also confirmed its option to provide an additional US$5 million ($6,960,500) in a second phase (the \"Second Term\"), which will be directed toward further exploration and the commissioning of a development program. Galantas retains the option to participate pro-rata in this future funding.\nIn connection with the Transaction, a shareholders' agreement has been executed, appointing Ocean Partners as operator of the Omagh Project. The Board of Directors of Flintridge will consist of four representatives nominated by Ocean Partners and one representative nominated by Galantas, for so long as Galantas maintains at least a 10% interest in Flintridge.\nDuring the Initial Term, Galantas holds the right to convert its 20% equity interest in Flintridge into a 3.00% Net Smelter Return (\"NSR\") royalty. Half of this royalty would be subject to buy-back by Flintridge for US$8 million ($11,319,606). If Galantas does not exercise this option and its ownership in Flintridge is subsequently diluted below 10%, its equity interest will automatically convert into a 1.50% NSR, with half of that amount subject to buy-back for US$4 million ($5,568,400).\nThe Company assessed that it no longer had control of Flintridge as of the closing date but retained significant influence. The Company is accounting for the retained investment as an investment in associate in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. In accordance with IAS 28, the fair value of the retained investment is the deemed cost of the investment in associate as at the closing date. A loss has been recognized in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive (loss) income, which is calculated as the difference between the closing date fair value of the retained investment and the carrying amount of the former subsidiaries net assets.\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nFair value of retained investment\n$\n5,954,818\n$\n-\nCarrying amount of former subsidiaries net assets (notes 7, 8, 9 and 15)\n(11,319,606\n)\n-\nReclassification of foreign currency translation reserve\n2,479,125\n-\nLoss on disposal of interest in subsidiaries\n$\n(2,885,663\n)\n$\n-\nInvestment in associates\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n-\nAdditions (fair value of retained investment)\n5,954,818\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n5,954,818\n7.\u00a0Property, Plant and Equipment\nFreehold\nPlant\nland and\nand\nMotor\nOffice\nDevelopment\nAssets under\nCost\nbuildings\nmachinery\nvehicles\nequipment\nassets\nconstruction\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n2,323,111\n$\n8,995,926\n$\n227,835\n$\n222,845\n$\n20,640,066\n$\n26,939\n$\n32,436,722\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,555,601\n-\n2,555,601\nTransfer\n-\n28,928\n-\n-\n-\n(28,928\n)\n-\nCash receipts from concentrate sales\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1,228,232\n)\n-\n(1,228,232\n)\nReversal of impairment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3,250,867\n-\n3,250,867\nForeign exchange adjustment\n164,468\n634,400\n16,130\n15,776\n1,548,305\n1,989\n2,381,068\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n2,487,579\n9,659,254\n243,965\n238,621\n26,766,607\n-\n39,396,026\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,866,876\n-\n1,866,876\nCash receipts from concentrate sales (note 14)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(787,929\n)\n-\n(787,929\n)\nDisposals of interest in subsidiaries (note 6)\n(2,580,299\n)\n(9,984,217\n)\n(253,058\n)\n(247,515\n)\n(28,651,230\n)\n-\n(41,716,319\n)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n92,720\n324,963\n9,093\n8,894\n805,676\n-\n1,241,346\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nAccumulated depreciation\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n1,939,409\n$\n7,061,856\n$\n181,541\n$\n159,745\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n9,342,551\nDepreciation\n3,298\n407,802\n13,975\n9,837\n-\n-\n434,912\nForeign exchange adjustment\n137,399\n509,830\n13,272\n11,606\n-\n-\n672,107\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n2,080,106\n7,979,488\n208,788\n181,188\n-\n-\n10,449,570\nDepreciation\n2,079\n257,249\n8,254\n6,589\n-\n-\n274,171\nDisposal of interest in subsidiaries (note 6)\n(2,159,755\n)\n(8,503,607\n)\n(224,969\n)\n(194,646\n)\n-\n-\n(11,082,977\n)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n77,570\n266,870\n7,927\n6,869\n-\n-\n359,236\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nCarrying value\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n407,473\n$\n1,679,766\n$\n35,177\n$\n57,433\n$\n26,766,607\n$\n-\n$\n28,946,456\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n8.\nExploration and Evaluation Assets\nAcquisition\nExploration\nCost\ncosts\ncosts\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n3,636,294\n$\n4,776,409\nAdditions\n-\n481,338\n481,338\nForeign exchange adjustment\n-\n229,449\n229,449\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n1,140,115\n4,347,081\n5,487,196\nAdditions\n-\n395,382\n395,382\nDisposal of interest in subsidiaries (note 6)\n-\n(4,243,418\n)\n(4,243,418\n)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n-\n140,330\n140,330\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n639,375\n$\n1,779,490\nCarrying value\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n4,347,081\n$\n5,487,196\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n639,375\n$\n1,779,490\n9.\u00a0Decommissioning Liability\nThe Company's decommissioning liability is a result of mining activities at the Omagh mine in Northern Ireland. The Company estimated its decommissioning liability at September 30, 2025 based on a risk-free discount rate of 1% (December 31, 2024 - 1%) and an inflation rate of 1.50% (December 31, 2024 - 1.50%). The expected undiscounted future obligations allowing for inflation are GBP 330,000 and based on management's best estimate the decommissioning is expected to occur over the next 5 to 10 years. On September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the liability is $nil (December 31, 2024 - $666,128).

The convertible debenture is unsecured, is for a term of three year commencing on the date that it is issued, carries a coupon of 10% per annum and is convertible into common shares of the Company. Each debenture consists of US$1,000 principal amount of unsecured convertible debentures. The convertible debentures have a term of 36 months from the date of issuance with a conversion price of US$0.255 being the equivalent of a conversion price of $0.35 per conversion share. A four month hold period will apply to common shares converted through the convertible debenture. The hold period expired on April 21, 2024.\nIn accordance with the terms of the convertible debentures, if, at any time following the issuance of the convertible debentures, the closing price of the common shares of the Company on the TSXV equals or exceeds $0.70 per common share for 10 consecutive trading days or more, the Company may elect to convert all but not less than all of the outstanding principal amount of the convertible debentures into conversion shares at the conversion price, upon giving the holders of the convertible debentures not less than 30 calendar days advance written notice. On December 20, 2026, any outstanding principal amount of convertible debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be repaid by the Company in cash.\nInterest on the principal amount outstanding under each convertible debenture shall accrue during the period commencing on December 20, 2023 until December 20, 2026 and shall be payable in cash on an annual basis on December 31st of each year (each, an \"Interest Payment Date\"); provided, however, that the first interest payment date shall be December 31, 2024. Each convertible debenture shall bear interest at a minimum interest rate of 10% per annum (the \"Base Interest Rate\"). During each interest period (an \"Interest Period\"), being the period commencing on December 20, 2023 to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and thereafter the period from and including an Interest Payment Date to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or other applicable payment date, the Base Interest Rate will be adjusted based on a gold price of US$2,000 per ounce, with the Base Interest Rate being increased by 1% per annum for each US$100 in which the average gold price for such Interest Period exceeds US$2,000 per ounce, up to a maximum interest rate of 30% per annum; provided, however, that, without the prior acceptance of the TSXV, the average interest rate shall not exceed 24% per annum during the term of the convertible debentures. Any adjustment to the Base Interest Rate in respect of an Interest Period shall be calculated based on the average gold price quoted by the London Bullion Market Association, being the LBMA Gold Price PM, in respect of the Interest Period ending on December 31, 2024, from December 20, 2023 to and including December 15, 2024, and for each subsequent Interest Period, from January 1st to and including December 15th of that year or 15 days prior to the applicable payment date.\nMelquart Limited (\"Melquart\"), an insider and control person of the Company (as defined by the TSXV), subscribed for US$875,000. Ocean Partners, which has a common director with the Company, acquired US$875,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures.\nThe Company paid a cash finder's fee of US$40,500 (CAD$53,990) and issued 158,823 non-transferable finder's warrants to Canaccord Genuity Corp. in consideration for providing certain finder services to the Company under the offering. Each finder warrant is exercisable to acquire one common share in the capital of the Company at an exercise price of $0.35 per common share at any time on or before December 20, 2026. The fair value of the 158,823 finder warrants was estimated at $24,670 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield - 0%, expected volatility - 107.02%, risk-free interest rate - 3.71% and an expected average life of 3 years.\nThe debentures consist of the liability component and conversion feature. Due to the convertible debenture being denominated in US$, the conversion feature has been presented as a non-cash derivative liability.\nOn the date of issuance, the fair value of the derivative liability was estimated to be $748,337 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield - 0%, expected volatility - 95.0%, risk-free interest rate - 3.94% and an expected average life of 3 years.\nOn issuance the fair value of the liability component was recorded at $2,918,833, discounted at an effective interest rate of 37%.\nThe Company incurred transaction costs of $153,481 which was allocated pro-rata on the value of the conversion feature and the liability component.\nAs at December 31, 2024, the fair value of the derivative liability was revalued at $60,086 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield - 0%, expected volatility - 100%, risk-free interest rate - 2.92% and an expected average life of 1.97 years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded accretion expense of $389,379 and interest expense of $454,248 as loan interest and bank charges less deposit interest in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $151,301 of the interest expense was related to the convertible debenture subscribed by Melquart. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $151,301 of the interest expense was related to the convertible debenture subscribed by Ocean Partners.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, $82,404 (US$60,000) of convertible debenture was converted into 235,294 common shares of the Company.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid interest of $157,422 (US$109,411).\nOn September 23, 2025, Melquart converted $1,210,300 (US$875,000) of its convertible debenture and accrued interest of $252,853 (US$182,803) into 17,630,050 common shares of the Company.\nOn September 23, 2025, the Company and Ocean Partners reached a debt settlement agreement as part of the Transaction (note 6) and $1,210,300 (US$875,000) of its convertible debenture and accrued interest of $347,660 (US$251,345) was satisfied in full. The settlement resulted in the derecognition of the convertible debenture and accrued interest. The difference between the carrying amount of the extinguished obligations and the fair value of the liability was recognized in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated as a gain on extinguishment of convertible debentures of $302,888.\nAs at September 30, 2025, the fair value of the derivative liability was revalued at $58,635 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield - 0%, expected volatility - 142%, risk-free interest rate - 2.47% and an expected average life of 1.22 years.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recorded accretion expense of $120,244 and $383,524, respectively and interest expense of $106,613 and $341,820, respectively as loan interest and bank charges less deposit interest in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, $13,097 and $91,440, respectively of the interest expense was related to the convertible debenture subscribed by Melquart. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, $108,992 and $187,335, respectively of the interest expense was related to the convertible debenture subscribed by Ocean Partners.\n(ii) On February 5, 2024, the Company announced that it closed a debt settlement transaction, pursuant to which the Company settled US$2,711,000 of indebtedness owing to Ocean Partners through the issuance of US$2,711,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible debentures of the Company.\nThe convertible debenture issued in connection with the debt settlement were issued on substantially the same terms as the unsecured convertible debentures closed on December 20, 2023.\nThe debentures consist of the liability component and conversion feature. Due to the convertible debenture being denominated in US$, the conversion feature has been presented as a non-cash derivative liability.\nOn the date of issuance, the fair value of the derivative liability was estimated to be $748,337 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield - 0%, expected volatility - 95.0%, risk-free interest rate - 4.28% and an expected average life of 2.87 years.\nThe fair value of the liability component was recorded at $2,918,833, discounted at an effective interest rate of 20%.\nAs at December 31, 2024, the fair value of the derivative liability was revalued at $63,456 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield - 0%, expected volatility - 100%, risk-free interest rate - 2.92% and an expected average life of 1.97 years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded accretion expense of $203,009 and interest expense of $482,978 as loan interest and bank charges less deposit interest in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recorded accretion expense of $57,458 and $184,859, respectively and interest expense of $692,969 and $960,478, respectively as loan interest and bank charges less deposit interest in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss.\nOn September 23, 2025, the Company and Ocean Partners reached a debt settlement agreement as part of the Transaction (note 6) and $3,749,855 (US$2,711,000) of its convertible debenture and accrued interest of $1,049,874 (US$759,018) was satisfied in full. The settlement resulted in the derecognition of the convertible debenture and accrued interest. The difference between the carrying amount of the extinguished obligations and the fair value of the liability was recognized in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated as a loss on extinguishment of convertible debentures of $313,358.\nConvertible\nDerivative\ndebenture\nliability\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n1,923,509\n$\n1,245,627\nPrincipal amount (ii)\n3,667,170\n-\nDerivative liability component (ii)\n(748,337\n)\n748,337\nConvertible debenture converted (i)\n(82,404\n)\n-\nInterest payment (i)\n(157,422\n)\n-\nInterest expense (i)(ii)\n937,226\n-\nAccretion expense (i)(ii)\n592,388\n-\nChange in fair value (i)(ii)\n-\n(1,870,422\n)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n424,025\n-\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n6,556,155\n123,542\nConvertible debenture converted (i)\n(1,149,650\n)\n(105,423\n)\nExtinguishment of convertible debentures (i)(ii)\n(5,949,379\n)\n(432,052\n)\nGain on extinguishment of convertible debentures (i)(ii)\n10,470\n-\nInterest expense (i)(ii)\n1,302,298\n-\nAccretion expense (i)(ii)\n568,383\n-\nChange in fair value (i)(ii)\n-\n472,568\nForeign exchange adjustment\n(255,820\n)\n-\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n1,082,457\n$\n58,635\n12.\nShare Capital and Reserves\na)\nAuthorized share capital\nAt September 30, 2025, the authorized share capital consisted of an unlimited number of common and preference shares issuable in Series.\nThe common shares do not have a par value.

Concentrate sales provisional revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 totalled approximately US$566,000 ($787,929), respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 - US$197,000 (CAD$265,930) and US$528,000 (CAD$712,747), respectively). However, until the mine reaches the commencement of commercial production, the net proceeds from concentrate sales will be offset against Development assets.\n15.\nRelated Party Disclosures\nRelated parties pursuant to IFRS include the Board of Directors, close family members, other key management individuals and enterprises that are controlled by these individuals as well as certain persons performing similar functions.\nRelated party transactions conducted in the normal course of operations are measured at the exchange amount and approved by the Board of Directors in strict adherence to conflict of interest laws and regulations.\n(a) The Company entered into the following transactions with related parties:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nInterest on related party loans\n(i)\n$\n332,027\n$\n156,096\n$\n1,212,145\n$\n453,202\n(i) Refer to note 15(a)(iii)(iv).\n(ii) Refer to note 11.\n(iii) As at September 30, 2025, the Company owes Ocean Partners $208,815 (December 31, 2024 - $12,613,719) which is recorded as due to related parties on the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of financial position.

Omagh believed this claim to be without merit. An appeal was lodged with the Tax Tribunals Service and the hearing started at the beginning of March 2017 and following a number of adjournments was completed in August 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Tax Tribunals Service issued their judgement dismissing the appeal by Omagh in respect of the assessments. As at December 31, 2024, a provision has been included in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements in respect of the aggregates levy plus interest and penalty.\nOn September 23, 2025, the Company sold 80% interest in Flintridge and 80% in Omagh to Ocean Partners as part of the Transaction and as a result, the provision is not included in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements anymore. Refer to note 6.\n18.\nEvents After the Reporting Period\n(i) On November 13, 2025, the Company announced that it has entered into a share purchase agreement (the \"Share Purchase Agreement\"), pursuant to which Galantas will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of RDL Mining Corp. (\"RDL\") in exchange for common shares (\"Galantas Shares\") of Galantas (the \"RDL Transaction\"). The RDL Transaction will create a combined company that intends to lead the advancement of the Indiana gold-copper project located in Chile (the \"Indiana Project\"), over which RDL holds an option to acquire a 100% interest from Miner\u00eda Activa SpA (\"Activa\") by meeting certain conditions (the \"Option\").\nThe Indiana Project sits within the rich copper-gold-silver belt of the coastal cordillera of the Atacama Region, Chile. The Indiana Project is an operating gold and copper mine, which is ready for immediate expansion. It comprises mineral concessions covering 923 hectares. It is currently 100% owned by Activa, subject to the Option.\nRDL Transaction terms\nAs consideration for the acquisition of RDL, each RDL shareholder (being Lawrence Roulston, Robert Sedgemore and Dorian L. (Dusty) Nicol (the \"RDL Shareholders\")) will receive approximately 44 million Galantas Shares (the \"RDL Shares\"), for an aggregate of approximately 132 million Galantas Shares, which represents 49.99% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares following the issue of the RDL Shares. Additionally, each RDL Shareholder will be granted a 0.66% net smelter returns (\"NSR\") royalty payable by Galantas in respect of the Indiana Project, for an aggregate NSR royalty of approximately 2%.\nThe completion of the RDL Transaction is subject to a number of terms and conditions contained in the Share Purchase Agreement, including without limitation, the approval of the TSXV, there not having occurred a material adverse change in the business of Galantas or RDL, and other standard conditions of closing for a transaction of this nature. There can be no assurance that all necessary approvals will be obtained or that all conditions of closing will be satisfied.\nFollowing the completion of the RDL Transaction and the Concurrent Financing (as defined below), each RDL Shareholder is expected to hold approximately 12.5% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares.\nActiva Option\nIn order to exercise the Option, RDL must make payments totaling US$15 million ($20.9 million) to Activa over a period of five years (the \"Option Period\"), with the first payment of US$500,000 ($696,050) paid by Ocean Partners as an advance to Galantas and paid to Activa in the fourth quarter of 2025 (the \"Ocean Payment\"). The Ocean Payment will be repaid by Galantas from the proceeds of the proposed fundraising as set out below. The remaining payments consist of US$1 million ($1.4 million) in years one and two, US$2 million ($2.8 million) in years three and four and a final payment of US$8.5 million ($11.8 million) in year five (together, the \"Option Payments\").\nRDL has committed to spend a minimum of US$1 million ($1.4 million) per year during the Option Period on exploration and development activities within the Indiana Project. In addition, RDL has committed to (i) excavate a minimum of five hundred linear metres of exploration drifts, (ii) complete a minimum of 2,500 metres of exploration drilling, or (iii) a combination thereof using an equivalence ratio of one metre of drifts for every five metres of drilling.\nUntil RDL has exercised the Option, RDL will be leasing the Indiana Project for a 10% NSR royalty payable to Activa. Until the Indiana Project goes into commercial production, the NSR royalty will be paid as a rent payment, which will not be less than 25% of the Option Payment corresponding to that year. Once the Indiana Project goes into commercial production, the NSR royalty will not be greater than 50% of the Option Payment corresponding to that year.\nThere is an existing NSR royalty of 2.5% payable to an underlying property owner, which covers approximately 40% of the present concessions comprising the Indiana Project and which will be payable by RDL, including after exercise of the Option.\nDetails on RDL\nRDL was incorporated in British Columbia on July 18, 2025, for the purpose of identifying, exploring and developing mining projects. RDL has entered into an agreement with 1555070 B.C. Ltd. (\"155\") in respect of a copper stream at the Indiana Project for a total upfront payment of $550,000 in return for a fixed percentage of copper produced at the Indiana Project to be delivered at a discount to the prevailing copper price (the \"Copper Stream\"). This $550,000 payment has been made to RDL. In return, RDL will deliver to 155 6% of the payable copper delivered from the Indiana Project, until 2,000,000 pounds of copper have been delivered, after which RDL will deliver to 155 3% of the payable copper produced at the Indiana Project, for which 155 will pay 20% of the spot price on delivery. Other than in relation to the Indiana Project, RDL has not entered into any other material agreements.\nBoard of Directors and Management\nPromptly following the closing of the RDL Transaction and subject to regulatory approval(s), Galantas will appoint Lawrence Roulston to its board of directors (the \"Galantas Board\") as a non-executive director and Robert Sedgemore as its Senior Vice President, Operations. Mr. Roulston will receive $30,000 per annum in director fees. Each of Mr. Roulston and Mr. Sedgemore are current shareholders and directors of RDL. No other changes are expected to be made to the Galantas Board or its senior management in connection with the RDL Transaction.\nDorian L. Nicol will act as a special advisor to the Company regarding exploration, on terms to be agreed between the parties in advance of closing of the RDL Transaction.\nConcurrent Financing\nConcurrent with the RDL Transaction, Galantas intends to raise up to $7 million pursuant to a brokered private placement of up to 87,500,000 units of Galantas, at a price of $0.08 per Unit (the \"Concurrent Financing\").\nEach unit will be comprised of one Galantas Share and one Galantas Share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Galantas Share for $0.12 for a period of 36 months from the closing date of the Concurrent Financing.\nThe Company has granted the agents an over-allotment option (the \"Agents' Option\"), which will permit the agents to raise up to an additional $1.05 million through sales of additional units. As compensation for their services, the Company will pay to the agents a cash commission equal to 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Concurrent Financing and the Company will issue to the agents compensation warrants in an amount equal to 7.0% of the units sold in the Concurrent Financing. Each compensation warrant will entitle the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share for $0.08 for a period of 24 months from the closing date of the Concurrent Financing. The Galantas Shares, Warrants and compensation warrants issuable from the Concurrent Financing will be subject to a statutory hold period expiring four months and one day from the closing of the Concurrent Financing.\nCompletion of the Concurrent Financing is expected to occur on or around December 4, 2025, and is subject to obtaining the required approvals of the TSXV and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nRDL Transaction Timeline\nPursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement and subject to satisfying all necessary conditions and receipt of all required approvals, the parties anticipate completion of the RDL Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nApproval of Board of Directors and Shareholder Support\nAfter consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the Galantas Board of Directors unanimously approved the entering into of the Share Purchase Agreement.\nFollowing consultation with certain shareholders, the Company has received confirmation from its shareholders who hold approximately 57% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares, confirming that they are fully supportive of each of the components of the RDL Transaction and that they would vote in favour of the RDL Transaction were a vote on the matter put to the shareholders of the Company at a general meeting. The Company confirms that there are currently no plans to hold a general meeting in order to approve the RDL Transaction.\n(ii)\u00a0On November 21, 2025, the Company announced the increase of the Concurrent Financing to raise up to $13.5 million, consisting of 168,750,000 units at a price of $0.08 per unit. The size of the over-allotment option granted to the agents will be upsized to permit the agents to raise up to an additional $2,025,000 through sales of up to 25,312,500 additional units.\nCompletion of the Concurrent Financing is expected to occur on or around December 10, 2025, and is subject to obtaining the required approvals of the TSXV and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. The acquisition represents a significant strategic step for Galantas and is expected to constitute a\u00a0Fundamental Acquisition\u00a0under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (\"\nTSXV\n\").\nAndacollo Oro Gold Project Overview\nThe Project is located in the Coquimbo Region, Chile, approximately 55 kilometres southeast of the coastal city of La Serena, at a low elevation of 1,100 metres. The Project includes a\nsubstantial permitted footprint with\u00a0mining concessions, land title, and water rights\u00a0in place. Extensive earthworks, mine infrastructure, and three leach pads remain on site with excellent access to infrastructure, services, and a skilled workforce.\nA\nhistorical mineral resource estimate(1)(2) for the Project estimates its measured and indicated mineral resources at an aggregate of 2.02 million (M) ounces (oz) of gold (Au), consisting of 130M tonnes (t) at 0.48 Au grams per tonne\n(g/t) and estimates its inferred mineral resources at\n5.06M oz Au, consisting of 358Mt at 0.45 Au g/t\n.\nThe historical mineral resource estimate\u00a0is derived from the\u00a0National Instrument 43-101\nStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\n(\"\nNI 43-101\n\") technical report titled \"\nCMID SPA, Andacollo Oro, Chile, Technical Report\"\nprepared by GEOINVEST SAC E.I.R.L. Chile, with an effective date of August 23, 2021 (the \"\nHistorical Report\n\").\nThe Historical Report states that the Project operated as a\u00a020,000 tonne per day (tpd) open pit heap leach operation, producing a cumulative\u00a01.12M oz Au between 1998 and 2018, with peak annual production of approximately\u00a0135,000 oz Au.\nGeologically, the Project hosts a\u00a0low-sulphidation epithermal, manto-style gold system. The deposit has been extensively evaluated by past operators, with\u00a01,600 drill holes completed for a total of approximately 190,000 metres, providing a robust technical database underpinning multiple historical studies and resource estimates.\nThe Project is adjacent to the producing Carmen del Andacollo porphyry copper mine (the \"\nCDA Mine\n\"), operated by Teck Resources Limited (\"\nTeck\n\"), which produces about 45,000 tonnes of copper per year. See \"Adjacent Property Disclosure\" below.\nMario Stifano, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented:\n\"This transaction represents a clear step-change in the scale and profile of Galantas. The acquisition of the Andacollo Oro Gold Project fundamentally repositions the Company, adding a large-scale, past-producing gold asset with existing infrastructure, permits, and a deep technical database in one of Chile's most established mining districts.\nWith an Adsorption-Desorption-Recovery plant at 200,000 oz per annum nameplate capacity, the Project provides Galantas with multiple development pathways and a level of optionality that is rarely available in a single transaction, while the staged consideration structure reflects our commitment to capital discipline and risk management. The Project has significant exploration potential for both additional gold and copper mineralization.\nImportantly, this acquisition complements our ongoing work at the Indiana Gold-Copper Project, where a Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway and drilling is planned for the first quarter of 2026. Together, these assets mark an evolution of Galantas from a single-asset company into a multi-asset platform, positioning the Company for disciplined growth and long-term value creation.\"\nTransaction Structure and Related-Party Disclosure\nThe Transaction will be effected by way of the Agreement, pursuant to which Galantas will acquire\u00a0100% of the shares of Sol de Oro Mining Ltd. (\"\nSol\n\"), which in turn owns\u00a0100% of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera OXI SpA (\"\nOXI\n\"). OXI has purchased 100% of the shares of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera e Inmobiliaria Dragones SpA (\"\nDragones\n\"), the owner of the Project, pursuant to certain share purchase agreements dated January 6, 2026 with the former Dragones shareholders (the \"\nDragones Agreements\n\"). All former Dragones shareholders are arm's length to OXI, Sol and Galantas. If the payments described below are not completed to the former Dragones shareholders, such shares will be transferred back to the former shareholders with any partial payments forfeited. Sol and OXI were established as dedicated transaction vehicles to consolidate ownership ",

(\"\nRDL\n\") in exchange for common shares (\"\nGalantas Shares\n\") of Galantas (the \"\nTransaction\n\"). The Transaction will create a combined company that intends to lead the advancement of the Indiana gold-copper project located in Chile (the \"\nIndiana Project\n\"), over which RDL holds an option to acquire a 100% interest from Miner\u00eda Activa SpA (\"\nActiva\n\") by meeting certain conditions (the \"\nOption\n\").\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"The Indiana Project represents a compelling dual\n\u2011\npath opportunity - with an operating mine and historical high\n\u2010\ngrade gold-copper resources, this Transaction positions Galantas to fast\n\u2011\ntrack the project into production, while simultaneously unlocking significant exploration upside by drilling the numerous outcropping and untested veins on the property. The addition of seasoned mining veterans, Lawrence Roulston and Robert Sedgemore, to our board and leadership team, respectively, further strengthens our ability to execute on this vision and deliver meaningful growth for our shareholders. Robert, who has extensive mine building expertise, including experience at Escondida and Chuquicamata, will lead the Indiana Project, as the Company ramps up production and unlocks its significant exploration potential.\"\nDetails on the Indiana Project\nThe Indiana Project is located 40 kilometres (km) from Copiap\u00f3 at 1470 metres above sea level, in one of the world's most prolific mining districts. The region combines exceptional geological endowment, strategic infrastructure, and a highly skilled local workforce. The Indiana Project sits within the rich copper\n\u2011\ngold\n\u2010\nsilver belt of the coastal cordillera of the Atacama Region, Chile, a region which has attracted major mining companies, including Fenix Gold, Minera\u202fCandelaria (Lundin Mining), Kinross\u202fGold and ENAMI. With Copiap\u00f3 serving as a well\n\u2011\nestablished staging and services hub - offering mining suppliers, experienced workforce and infrastructure such as power and transport routes - projects benefit from reduced lead times and enhanced operational flexibility.\nThe Indiana Project is an operating gold and copper mine, which is ready for immediate expansion. It comprises mineral concessions covering 923 hectares. It is currently 100% owned by Activa, subject to the Option.\nWork by previous operators of the Indiana Project includes 13,000 metres of diamond drilling in 40 holes, 2,000 chip and trench samples, and detailed geology and structural modelling. Eight major ~1 metre wide veins ranging up to 1.5 kilometres in length and down to 400 metres depth have been delineated.\nA historical inferred mineral resource estimate for the Indiana Project1 outlines 607,000 ounces of gold equivalent (AuEq)2, consisting of 3.09 million tonnes, averaging 2.8 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 1.6% copper, at a 4 g/t AuEq cut-off, supported by a technical report (the \"\n2013 Technical Report\n\") prepared for Activa in accordance with National Instrument 43-101\nStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\n(\"\nNI 43-101\n\"). Metallurgical tests indicate very good recoveries for sulphide material of approximately 90% for gold and 95% for copper.\nThe historical inferred mineral resource estimate2 for the veins averaging over 4 g/t AuEq is summarized in the table below.\nVein\nTonnage\nAu\n(g/t)\nCu\n(%)\nMo\n(%)\nAuEq (g/t)\nAuEq ounces\nBondadosa\n910,400\n3.4\n1\n0.019\n5.5\n160,900\nRucas\n750,200\n2.1\n1.7\n0.006\n5.6\n133,800\nFlor de Espino\n638,100\n3.5\n1.3\n0.002\n6.3\n128,300\nIndian III\n351,400\n1.9\n1.4\n0.009\n4.9\n55,200\nRosario\n443,600\n2.7\n3.1\n0.01\n9.0\n128\nTotal\n3,093,700\n2.8\n1.6\n0.01\n6.1\n607,000\nThe Company is updating the mineral resource estimate for the Indiana Project, and an updated NI 43-101 technical report is expected to be completed before the end of November 2025. The updated mineral resource estimate is being prepared by DRA Global and will include the results of drilling and underground channel sampling completed since the 2013 Technical Report.\nThe historical resource includes only five veins drilled to a vertical depth of 300 metres. Over 20 veins, as well as outcropping breccia, remain untested over the 25\u202fkm of identified major and minor veins. Two underground declines provide access for exploration and development and enable near-term mining potential.\nTransaction Terms\nAs consideration fo",

          "full_content": "24 Sep 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 5317A\nGalantas Gold Corporation\n24 September 2025\nGALANTAS GOLD CLOSES TRANSACTION TO FORM JOINT VENTURE WITH OCEAN PARTNERS UK LIMITED TO DEVELOP OMAGH GOLD PROJECT IN NORTHERN IRELAND\nSEPTEMBER 24, 2025, TORONTO, CANADA - Galantas Gold Corporation (TSX-V & AIM: GAL; OTCQB: GALKF) (\"Galantas\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has closed the previously announced joint venture transaction with Ocean Partners UK Limited (\"Ocean Partners\") to develop the high-grade Omagh Gold Project in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland (the \"Omagh Project\"), as described in the Binding Term Sheet dated June 6, 2025 (see Galantas Gold's news release dated June 9, 2025).\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"We are delighted to have closed this transformative transaction with Ocean Partners. With finance in place and the joint venture formally established, work will begin on a new drill program targeting high-grade zones at the Joshua Vein and testing the northern extension of the Kearney Vein to accelerate resource definition at the Omagh Project.\n\"With the Company's now strengthened financial position, through the substantially reduced legacy debt along with the Melquart debt conversion, Galantas will continue advancing its other interests, including exploration at the Gairloch high-grade gold and copper volcanogenic massive sulphide (\"VMS\") project in Scotland.\"\nHighlights of the Closing\nOcean Partners has completed the exchange of its existing loans, totalling approximately US$14 million (GBP \u00a310.3 million), for an 80% interest in Flintridge Resources Limited (\"Flintridge\") and Omagh Minerals Ltd (\"Omagh Minerals\"), subsidiaries of Galantas that collectively own the Omagh Project. As a result, Galantas retains a 20% interest in each subsidiary.\nAs part of the transaction, Ocean Partners has provided an initial capital investment of US$3 million (GBP \u00a32.2 million). These funds are allocated toward exploration, restart planning, and general and administrative costs during the first phase of the joint venture, referred to as the Initial Term. Galantas is free carried during this period. Ocean Partners has also confirmed its option to provide an additional US$5 million (GBP \u00a33.7 million) in a second phase (the \"Second Term\"), which will be directed toward further exploration and the commissioning of a development program. Galantas retains the option to participate pro-rata in this future funding.\nIn connection with the joint venture, a shareholders' agreement has been executed, appointing Ocean Partners as operator of the Omagh Project. The board of Flintridge will consist of four representatives nominated by Ocean Partners and one representative nominated by Galantas, for so long as Galantas maintains at least a 10% interest in Flintridge.\nDuring the Initial Term, Galantas holds the right to convert its 20% equity interest in Flintridge into a 3.00% Net Smelter Return (\"NSR\") royalty. Half of this royalty would be subject to buy-back by Flintridge for US$8 million (GBP \u00a35.9 million). If Galantas does not exercise this option and its ownership in Flintridge is subsequently diluted below 10%, its equity interest will automatically convert into a 1.50% NSR, with half of that amount subject to buy-back for US$4 million (GBP \u00a33.0 million).\nClosing of Melquart Debt Transaction\nThe Company also announces the closing of the Proposed Melquart Debt Transaction, previously announced on June 9, 2025. Pursuant to shareholder approval at the Annual & Special Meeting held on August 5, 2025, Melquart converted US$875,000 (GBP \u00a3646,171) of its debt under a convertible note, plus accrued interest of US$182,803 (GBP \u00a3134,997), into 17,630,050 common shares of no par value (\"Common Shares\") in Galantas, at a deemed price of US$0.06 (GBP \u00a30.044) per share (the \"Melquart Common Shares\").\nFollowing the closing of the Melquart Debt Transaction, Melquart now holds 47,372,977 Common Shares, representing approximately 35.4% of the issued share capital of Galantas. The Common Shares issued in connection with the Melquart Debt Transaction are subject to a hold period of four months and a day, expiring on January 24, 2026.\nIssued Share Capital on Admission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made for the admission of the Melquart Common Shares to trading on AIM, with admission expected to occur on or around September 29, 2025 (\"Admission\"). Following Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 132,400,637 Ordinary Shares each with one voting right per share. There are no shares held in treasury. When calculating the total number voting rights, shareholders should use this figure as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Reg",

Ocean Partners will exchange approximately US$14 million (GBP \u00a310.3 million) in existing loans for an 80% interest in Flintridge Resources Limited (\"Flintridge\") and an 80% interest in Omagh Minerals Ltd (\"Omagh Minerals\"), subsidiaries of Galantas which together own the Omagh Project (the \"Proposed Transaction\"). The remaining 20% interest in Flintridge and 20% interest in Omagh Minerals will be retained by Galantas.\nFollowing the Proposed Transaction, Ocean Partners will have the option to convert the approximately US$1 million (GBP \u00a3738,481) of remaining debt into a 0.001% interest in Flintridge at any time after mining has restarted on the Omagh Project.\nOcean Partners will invest an initial US$3 million (GBP \u00a32.2 million) in the Omagh Project\nfor exploration, a restart plan and general and administrative costs for a period of up to one year (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, Ocean Partners will have the option to invest an additional US$5 million (GBP \u00a33.7 million) for exploration and commissioning a development program for a period of up to one year (the \"Second Term\"). Galantas will be free carried on the initial US$3 million\n(GBP \u00a32.2 million)\ninvestment and will have the option to invest its pro-rata share on future investments, including the Second Term.\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"We are very pleased to enter into the Proposed Transaction with Ocean Partners, a long-standing stakeholder who recognizes the district-scale and high-grade potential of the Omagh Project. The Proposed Transaction represents a turning point in the Omagh Project's development, enabling Galantas to benefit from a recommencement in production amid rising gold prices, while also strengthening the Company's balance sheet. The Company will have the benefit of receiving gold ounces once the Omagh Project is restarted, while also advancing the Gairloch high-grade gold and copper VMS project in Scotland. Upon closing of the Proposed Transaction, the joint venture intends to commence a drill program targeting the high-grade zones at the Omagh Project's Joshua Vein and test the northern extension of the Kearney Vein.\"\nRule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies - Fundamental change of business\nThe Proposed Transaction constitutes a fundamental change in business under\nRule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies\nby virtue of the size of the disposition and is\nsubject to shareholder approval at a meeting or by a written shareholders' resolution signed by at least 50% of the shareholders of the issuer.\nNotwithstanding the Company proposes to divest substantially all of its trading business and assets, the Company will continue to be admitted to trading on AIM and will not be classified as an AIM Rule 15 cash shell. If the Proposed Transaction is concluded, Galantas will focus on\ninitiating an inaugural mineral resource estimate at the Gairloch Project in Scotland and also commence an exploration drilling program at Gairloch.\nUpon closing of the Proposed Transaction, Ocean Partners and Galantas will sign a shareholders agreement (the \"Joint Venture\") focused on exploration and restart plans with Ocean Partners as project operator.\nThe board of directors of Flintridge shall be comprised of four representatives of Ocean Partners and one representative of the Company for so long as the Company owns at least a 10% interest in Flintridge. There will be no change to the board of directors of the Company following the\nProposed Transaction\n. Flintridge will have a fixed valuation of US$15 million (GBP \u00a311.1 million) for future cash calls.\nDuring the Initial Term, Galantas shall have the option (the \"Galantas Option\") to convert its 20% ownership interest in Flintridge into a 3.00% net smelter return royalty (the \"3% NSR\"). 50% of the 3% NSR shall be subject to a buy-back provision for US$8 million (GBP \u00a35.9 million) by Flintridge. In the event that: (i) Galantas does not exercise the Galantas Option during the Initial Term; and (ii) Galantas is diluted to below 10% ownership in Flintridge, the entirety of Galantas' ownership shall automatically convert to a 1.5% net smelter return royalty (the \"1.5% NSR\"). The remaining 50% of the 1.5% NSR shall be subject to a buy-back provision for US$4 million (GBP \u00a33.0 mil",

The trial stoping has provided sufficient information to bring a high level of confidence for a successful stoping program in the future.\n\"\nProvisional revenues generated from concentrate sales totalled approximately US$1,103,000 in 2023 and approximately US$207,000 in Q1 2024. The net proceeds from concentrate sales are being offset against development assets, until the mine commences commercial production.\nSix stopes were successfully mined and backfilled using a narrow vein, modified Avoca longhole open stoping method, in two separate blocks. The minimum stope width was 2.2 metres planned with a stope length of 10 to 15 metres. Vertical distance between the stoping levels was approximately 8 metres from roof to floor. Following the success of the trial, the Company plans to increase the distance between levels to 12 metres. Relatively low-grade areas of the mine were selected for the trial to assess the suitability of the mining method and also to serve as a training project for the locally trained mining operators.\nA total of 3,175 tonnes of mineralized material was successfully mined from the six stopes during this phase in a safe and controlled manner. Reconciliation was completed for two of the stopes, and grades returned an average percentage increase of 113%* from the grade modelled in the technical report \"Resource Estimate, Preliminary Economic Assessment & Detailed Feasibility Study on the Omagh Gold Project, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland\" dated July 26, 2014 and filed on September 4, 2014.\nTrials have led to an optimized cycle of two days from the initial stope blast to completion of backfill, thus reducing the potential for dilution and also streamlining the process. This mining method can now be applied to more than 240 stopes which are already planned for the Kearney and Joshua zones, with grades in the range of 2.0 grams per tonne (g/t) gold to 17 g/t.\n*Higher grade reconciliation may not be indicative of future grade reconciliations.\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical information relating to production and development in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Brendan Morris, who is considered, by virtue of his education, experience and professional association, a Qualified Person within the meaning of NI 43-101.

We previously drilled 32 grams per tonne gold over 4.4 metres, and 32 grams per tonne gold over 7 metres1 within dilation zones on the Kearney Vein. In this program, we are aiming to uncover the exciting potential to extend the resource northwards and build on our existing high-grade gold resources.\"\nAt the Cavanacaw deposit area where sulphide rich, gold-bearing veins are well developed, geological modelling suggests that a concealed ore shoot may lie to the north of the site at greater depth. The target area, approximately 180 metres north of the current extent of the main Kearney Vein, coincides with a historical Pionjar (base of till) anomaly of 31.5 grams per tonne gold (see Figure 1).\nThe Kearney Vein system has a strike length of approximately 850 metres, proved by drilling. It remains open at depth down plunge. The vein is well developed in the 'Cavanacaw Member', a competent host lithology. This host unit dips to the north and is expected to lie beneath a pelitic horizon in the current target area.\nThe program comprises three drill holes (approximately 1,000 metres) which will test the Kearney Vein extension at depths over 200 metres. The work will be completed under Permitted Development following a positive meeting of the Local Council Planning Committee on May 22, 2024.\nFigure 1: Map of the main Kearney and Joshua veins, North Kearney target area and historical Pionjar drill results.\n1\nAt the Kearney Vein, examples of drill holes that fall within dilation zones are drill hole FR-DD-22-UG-181 at a vertical depth of 150 metres that intersected 7 metres (estimated 3.3 metres true thickness) of 31.7 grams per tonne (g/t) gold, and drill hole FR-DD-22-UG-186 at a vertical depth of 143 metres that intersected 4.4 metres (estimated 3.0 metres true thickness) of 31.8 g/t gold (see Galantas' news releases dated March 21, 2022 and August 4, 2022).\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical disclosures in this news release have been reviewed and approved by Dr\n.\nSarah Coulter, who is considered, by virtue of her education, experience and professional association, a Qualified Person under the terms of NI 43-101.

Cornavarrow represents an exciting target that has never previously been drilled, and would be key in helping us to glean the wider potential of the gold district.\n\"We're also keen to continue drilling at the main Joshua Vein which runs broadly parallel to and some 450 metres west of the other main Kearney Vein. Positive drilling results from the last few years have delineated trends of dilation zones, which have potential for higher widths of mineralization. Testing the down-dip potential of the dilation zones at Joshua could aid in resource expansion and ultimately add to the Omagh Mine's production capacity.\"\nThe effectiveness of the IP method for defining\nmineralization\ntargets in this terrain was tested by the Company in 2021 when it ran a similar survey over the Elkins Vein. An apparent resistivity IP anomaly aligned north-south coinciding with known\nmineralization\n(see\nGalantas' news release\ndated December 1, 2021). Another IP survey was completed over the Pigeon Top target (1.5\nkilometres\nwest of the mine site) in 2021,\nand\nalso identified a strong north-south trending resistor over\n500 metres\n, coinciding with base-of-till gold anomalies.\nThe\nElkins, Pigeon Top and Cornavarrow\ntargets\nare shown in\nFigure\n1\nand are situated along\na\nsix\n-kilometre\nstrike. According to Consulting Geophysicist\nGraham Reid\nof BRG Ltd\n.,\nthe geophysical anomalies identified during those earlier surveys most likely represent fault structures in the bedrock. North trending faults are a prime exploration target as these are the structures that host\nmineralization\non the mine site.\nIn January 2024,\nGalantas commissioned an IP survey grid over\na 1.4-square-kilometre area at\nthe Cornavarrow target\n(see\nFigure\n2\n).\nCornavarrow lies five\nkilometres\nwest of the Cavanacaw Gold Mine. The area was explored by RioFinex in the late\n1980s.\nGold and base metal anomalies were recorded for float rock and stream sediments at that time; significantly, a small vein exposure was also identified 'Cornavarrow Burn East Showing' (see\nFigure 2\n). A 2003 technical report by ACA Howe contained an intersection grading 1.15 grams per tonne (g/t) gold, 4.2 g/t silver and 1,366 g/t lead over 1.5 metres in width\nacross the portion of visible vein\nand stated that \"what is visible at Cornavarrow Burn East Showing could be the edge of higher-grade mineralization which is not exposed.\" Subsequent exploration by Galantas geologists recorded 3.5 g/t gold for a chipped sample of outcrop.\nFigure 1:\nMap\nshowing the location of key\nexploration\ntargets\n.\nNew geophysical results over Cornavarrow shown in inset and\nFigure\n2\n.\nThe eastern margin of the 900-metre northerly trending resistor lies 100 metres west of the in-situ vein mineralization. BRG Ltd. theorized that the Cornavarrow resistor may represent a zone of increased silicification within the mapped psammites. Galantas geologists have noted silicification associated with gold-bearing quartz veins at Cavanacaw.\nThe target area sits largely within the 'Cavanacaw Member', a competent lithology just north of a thrust fault. The structural setting is therefore similar to that at the mine site. No diamond drilling has been conducted in the area to date.\nFigure 2: Contoured apparent resistivity data over Cornavarrow target. Black dots show grid measurement points.

The work will include petrology, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron microprobe (EMP) analysis on selected rock samples. This sampling work is expected to help identify new target areas for follow-up exploration work and drilling.\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"We are honored to collaborate with the University of Edinburgh and look forward to the results of this detailed work. The team at the university's School of Geosciences brings experience in cutting-edge research and expert knowledge of VMS systems to help us better understand the Kerry Road deposit and determine the location of other mineralized bodies in the vicinity.\"\nOverview of VMS deposits and work with the University of Edinburgh\nThe green energy transition will require significant amounts of metals such as copper, zinc and cobalt to enable the growth of clean technologies, electric vehicles and renewables. The Kerry Road copper-zinc-gold deposit at the Gairloch Project is classified as a Besshi-type VMS deposit, which is associated with cobalt enrichment. Additionally, its host rocks appear to be geologically similar to those in the Trans-Hudson Orogen in Manitoba and Saskatchewan which contain the prolific Flin-Flon and Snow Lake VMS mining camps. This makes the Kerry Road deposit an important potential resource for the future.\nVMS deposits are rarely solitary and typically exhibit multiple mineralized bodies in each system. These systems are formed through hydrothermal activity, which alters the surrounding rock and leaves a geochemical signature (or alteration halo) which can be detected through certain types of detailed analysis and observations. Each mineral deposit will have its own unique geochemical signature based on the composition of the local rock. This project with the University of Edinburgh aims to identify the Kerry Road's unique signature using garnet, chlorite, white mica and other silicate minerals. The results will be compared to new and existing data from other metamorphosed VMS deposits of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia - for example, Teutonic Bore, Wheatley, King, and Nimbus. The work is supported by grants from the Geological Society of London and Geological Society of Glasgow to the University of Edinburgh PhD student Cendi Dana.\nRepresentative footwall, ore horizon and hanging-wall samples from drill core and outcrops have been collected for petrography, mineral chemistry, and whole-rock geochemical analysis. Whole-rock geochemical analysis will be carried out using x-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to establish geochemical trends and alteration halos. Mineralogy will be characterized by petrographic observations (transmitted and reflected light petrology, and scanning electron microscopy), coupled with mineral chemical analysis using an electron microprobe at the University of Edinburgh's Materials and Micro-Analysis Centre. When coupled with whole-rock geochemical data, the EMP data will allow geologists to determine the factors involved in the changes of mineral chemistry. This project will further characterize the alteration mineralogy of the Kerry Road deposit, and aid exploration efforts toward additional discoveries in the regional stratigraphy.\nFor more information on the Gairloch Project and drill results to date, see Galantas' press releases dated July 10, 2023; July 27, 2023; August 29, 2023; and October 16, 2023.\nFigures 1 & 2: Outcrop of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite mineralization found 300 metres northwest along trend from the Kerry Road deposit.\nGalantas Gold announces marketing contracts\nThe Company announces that it engaged GRIT Capital Corp (\"Grit\") of Toronto, Ontario, to create print advertising campaigns, including in GRIT's flagship newsletter, a landing page for advertising campaigns and CEO presentations on Twitter spaces, to provide the Company with exposure to potential investors, in accordance with Policy 3.4 - Investor Relations, Promotional and Market-Making Activities of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"Exchange\").

Mineralization has been drilled over an area 1 km in strike, up to 150 metres wide and to a depth of 250 metres, and remains open. The Company plans to conduct modern geophysics over the 10 km-long known mineralized belt to prioritize drilling targets for a planned new drilling program.\"\nTable 1: Summary of drill results.\nHole\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nWidth (m)\nEst.

Metallurgical factors are assumed to be 100% although recovery factors and smelter returns may vary significantly.\n3. True widths are estimated to be 64.3% of intersection lengths. Hole 23-GL-05 was drilled vertical into the mineralized unit which is assumed to dip at 50 degrees.\nDrill program\nDrill hole 23-GL-05 was a vertical hole drilled 22 metres east of hole 23-GL-04, intersecting the mineralized unit at 10 metres down to 44.25 metres. This hole targeted a geophysical anomaly and also acted as a stratigraphic hole. Previously unknown zones of mineralization were identified for a further 100 metres below the main mineralized zone down to a depth of 144 metres.\nThis drilling program was localized within 100 metres of where the mineralized unit is exposed at surface. Historical drilling identified a 1 km-long mineralized trend which the Company will aim to explore and expand in the coming year (see Figure 1).\nThe deepest intersection to date has been in historical hole GBH82 collared 620 metres to the southeast of the current hole, which intersected 5 metres at 1.07 g/t Au and 1.75% Cu at 250 metres depth.\nFigure 1: Map showing drill hole locations at the Gairloch Project.\nFor more information about historical drill holes referenced in Figure 1, see Galantas' news releases dated January 27, 2023 and August 29, 2023.\nFigure 2: Uncut section of drill core from hole 23-GL-05 showing massive sulphide.\nTable 2: Drill hole location.\nHole\nEasting\nNorthing\nElevation (m)\nAzimuth (grid)\nDip\nLength (m)\n23-GL-05\n183844\n872446\n150\n-\n-90\n390\nGairloch Project overview\nThe Kerry Road deposit is a stratabound, Besshi-style, VMS gold-copper-zinc deposit exposed at surface. It is one of the oldest known Besshi deposits, similar in age to the Sherridon district in Manitoba, Canada. The Kerry Road deposit was discovered by Consolidated Goldfields in the 1970s where 87 holes were drilled over 9,189 metres. No commercial exploration has taken place since then until 2018 when drilling by GreenOre Gold PLC (\"GreenOre\") confirmed the presence of mineralization at Kerry Road by intersecting 1.0 g/t gold, 0.9% copper and 0.6% zinc over 17 metres (see Galantas' news release dated January 27, 2023). Rock chip sampling conducted by GreenOre in 2018 also identified elevated levels of cobalt in the bedrock.\nThe Kerry Road deposit lies within the Gairloch Schist Belt, a Paleoproterozic volcanic arc terrane extending over 25 km. The unit of interest is a quartz carbonate schist with the main minerals being chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. Limited exploration has been conducted over the area in recent years. The British Geological Survey (BGS) identified an outcrop of 4 g/t Au in their MRP146 report of the area, associated with a significant geophysical anomaly approximately 10 km south of the Kerry Road deposit, yet the area remains untested. This area is one of multiple targets identified by",

We are keen to establish new target areas for further drill testing and resource drilling, to unlock the full potential of the 217 km\u00b2 land package covering the Gairloch Schist Belt.\"\nTable 1: Summary of drill results.\nHole\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nWidth (m)\nGold (g/t)\nCopper (%)\nZinc (%)\nCobalt (%)\nSilver (g/t)\nCopper Equivalent (%)\n23-GL-03\n35.00\n53.00\n18.00\n1.34\n0.86\n0.16\n82\n3.20\n1.95\n23-GL-04\n10.00\n41.00\n31.00\n4.42\n0.71\n0.52\n69\n3.74\n4.17\nincluding\n12.05\n19.00\n6.95\n15.46\n0.80\n1.91\n133\n6.35\n12.82\nNotes:\n1. Reported intervals are downhole widths.\n2. The copper equivalent values are estimated using approximate metal prices of $8,350/t copper, $2,480/t zinc, $1,900/oz gold, $23/oz silver and $33,140/t cobalt and are presented for ease of interval comparison only. Metallurgical factors are assumed to be 100% although recovery factors and smelter returns may vary significantly.\n3. True widths unknown due to local structural complexities. Hole 23-GL-03 was drilled at 223 azimuth, perpendicular to assumed strike of ore body at -45 degrees dip. Hole 23-GL-04 was drilled as a scissor hole to hole 23-GL-03, 50m south at an azimuth of 43 degrees and -55 degrees dip.\nDrill program\nDrill hole 23-GL-03 was drilled 57 metres southeast of hole 23-GL-02, intersecting the mineralized unit at 35 metres down to 53 metres. Hole 23-GL-04 was drilled 49 metres southwest of hole 23-GL-03, towards the mineralized unit in the opposite direction, hitting the zone from 10 metres to 41 metres. This hole was a 15-metre step out from the known historic deposit area.\nThe deep hole, 23-GL-05, has been drilled to a depth of 390 metres, and is being logged and split. The Company will now focus on identifying the deposit's extension.\nThe current drilling was localized within 100 metres of where the mineralized unit is exposed at surface. Historical drilling identified a 900-metre-long mineralized trend which the Company will aim to explore and expand in the coming year (see Figure 1). Historical hole GBH82 intersected the mineralized unit at around 250 metres below surface over 620 metres southeast from the Company's hole 23-GL-05. Hole GBH82 intersected 5 metres at 1.07 g/t Au and 1.75% Cu.\nWorking 120 metres back towards Galantas' recent drilling, historical hole GBH81 intersected 6 metres at 0.85 g/t Au and 1.19% Cu at around 200 metres below surface. At around 150 metres below surface, historical drill hole GBH68 intersected 6 metres at 1.5 g/t Au and 5.92% Cu. At 100 metres below surface, historical drill hole GBH67 intersected 6 metres at 2.27 g/t Au and 2.28% Cu.\nIn the opposite direction going 280 metres northwest along strike from the recent drilling area, historical hole GBH48 intersected 10 metres at 0.12 g/t Au and 0.5% Cu. These new and historical grades over such a wide area demonstrate the potential of the Kerry Road deposit with future drilling planned to explore along strike and at depth.\nFor more information about historical drill holes referenced above, see Galantas' news release dated\nJanuary 26, 2023.\nFigure 1: Map showing location of selected drill holes at the Gairloch Project.\nFigure 2: Uncut section of drill core from hole 23-GL-04 showing massive sulphide.\nProspecting at Gairloch Project\nThe prospecting results have identified a gold bearing unit 1.4 kilometres southeast from the recent drill hole 23-GL-05.

Ireland (\"\nQME\n\") has provided a contract mining plan for the Company's Omagh Gold Project (\"\nOmagh\n\") in Northern Ireland, leveraging QME's highly skilled workforce and state-of-the-art original equipment manufacturer (OEM) mining equipment.\nQME's extensive mining experience across Europe, including its notable involvement in the development and bulk sampling of Dalradian's nearby gold project located just 20 km from Omagh, positions them as an ideal partner for this endeavour. QME would begin with development mining at the Kearney and Joshua veins for an expected period of 9 months, before anticipated ramp up to approximately 5,000 tonnes per month of both development and production (stope) mineralized material within 12 months of start-up. QME estimates the cost of development prior to achieving steady-state production is approximately US$12 million.\nThe Company anticipates mining the high-grade dilation zones and has the goal of monthly production of 1,200 to 1,400 gold ounces after completion of development. With multiple mine levels developed at both Joshua and Kearney veins, and the experienced QME underground workforce, the Company along with QME are scoping an expansion to the existing permitted mill to increase targeted annual production of 30,000 to 35,000 gold ounces per annum.\nUpdate on exploration drilling at Joshua Vein\nGalantas has successfully intersected massive sulphides in drill hole FR-DD-23-196, a projected dilation zone at the Joshua Vein. This is the first exploration hole to be drilled from surface in 19 months, filling in a large gap in the earlier resource model. Assay results for this hole are pending.\nHigh-grade dilation zones at the Joshua Vein remain open along strike and down-plunge. Previously at Joshua, the Company successfully identified multiple wide high-grade intersections (see Figure 1) including: 9.9 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (Au) over a 21.6-metre intersection with hole OM-DD-15-155, 8.4 g/t Au over 26.6 metres with hole OM-DD-12-103, and 17.4 g/t Au over 13.1 metres with hole FR-DD-21-175. For additional information, see Galantas' news releases dated June 11, 2012, January 25, 2016 and January 31, 2022.\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"We are looking forward to having QME begin development work at Omagh, as it has the workforce and equipment to quickly commence development and mining with a plan to provide a sustainable 5,000 tonnes per month of mill feed. As we've kicked off drilling at the Joshua Vein from surface, we will focus on resource expansion at the Joshua and Kearney veins to expand known resources with a goal to increase the mill capacity from 180 tonnes per day to 500 tonnes per day. In addition, with the recent successful drilling at the Gairloch Project, including hole 23-GL-02 intersecting 1.88 g/t gold, 1.23% copper, 0.51% zinc, 0.01% cobalt and 4.64 g/t silver over 33 metres1, we will look to expand our exploration efforts in northern Scotland.\"\nFigure 1: Long section of the Joshua Vein showing the dilation zone trends (in yellow arrows) with some key intersections, and the location of the latest intersection on hole FR-DD-23-196.

Metallurgical factors are assumed to be 100% although recovery factors and smelter returns may vary significantly.\n3. True width estimated at 99.6% of intersect width (32.87 metres and 19.26 metres respectively), based on historical information that the unit dips at approximately 50 degrees. Galantas drilled down dip at 45 degrees intersecting the mineralization at 85 degrees.\nDrill program\nThis drill hole was a 50-metre step back from hole 23-GL-01 (see Galantas' news release dated July 10, 2023) and is part of a program of six holes aiming to test the Kerry Road deposit. The mineralized horizon intercepted in this hole 23-GL-02 was observed within a quartz-carbonate-rich unit between hornblende schist, much like the first hole 23-GL-01. The sulphide within this horizon was predominantly massive and semi-massive pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.\nA total of 494 metres has been drilled to date, with the results of holes 3 and 4 expected in the coming weeks. Hole 5 is a deep hole currently drilling below the known deposit.\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"This second hole has proven to be far richer and wider than anticipated. The results further confirm our belief that we are sitting on a potentially significant and district-scale, high-grade polymetallic mineral deposit and one that could be of strategic importance for the UK and Europe's critical metal supply.\"\nFigure 1: Section of drill core from hole 23-GL-02 showing rich chalcopyrite (a sulphide mineral that contains approximately 34% copper by weight).\nProspecting at the Gairloch Project\nProspecting has identified multiple massive sulphide horizons in outcrop at newly exposed bedrock from a road cutting 1.5km east of the Kerry Road deposit. Results of the sampling are expected within the coming weeks. Further prospecting will continue along trend towards the Gorm Lochs Prospect which lies 10km south of Kerry Road.

It is one of the oldest known Besshi deposits, similar in age to the Sherridon district in Manitoba, Canada. The Kerry Road deposit was discovered by Consolidated Goldfields in the 1970s where 87 holes were drilled over 9,189 metres. No commercial exploration has taken place since then until 2018 when drilling by GreenOre Gold PLC (GreenOre) confirmed the presence of mineralization at Kerry Road by intercepting 1.0 g/t gold, 0.9% copper and 0.6% zinc over 17 metres (see Galantas' news release dated January 26, 2023). Rock chip sampling conducted by GreenOre in 2018 also identified elevated levels of cobalt in bedrock.\nThe Kerry Road deposit lies within the Gairloch Schist Belt, a Paleoproterozic volcanic arc terrane extending over 25 km. The unit of interest is a quartz carbonate schist with the main minerals being chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. Limited exploration has been conducted over the area in recent years. The British Geological Survey (BGS) identified an outcrop of 4 g/t Au in their MRP146 report of the area, associated with a significant geophysical anomaly approximately 10 km south of the Kerry Road deposit, yet the area remains untested.

The drill results from our most extensive exploration program since the 2014 resource estimate have increased our confidence in the high gold grades at the Omagh Project,\nfurther confirming its potential particularly at the Joshua Vein, which we are keen to explore.\"\nMineral Resource Estimate for the Kearney and Joshua Vein System\nTable 1: Mineral Resources of the Kearney and Joshua vein system, effective June 22, 2023.\nClassification\nVein\nTonnage (tonnes)\nGold Grade (grams/tonne)\nContained Gold (ounces)\nMeasured\nKearney\n94,131\n6.73\n20,371\nJoshua\n18,381\n6.59\n3,897\nIndicated\nKearney\n402,924\n6.50\n84,258\nJoshua\n247,217\n7.39\n58,730\nMeasured + Indicated\nKearney\n497,055\n6.54\n104,629\nJoshua\n265,598\n7.33\n62,627\nTotal Measured + Indicated\n762,653\n6.82\n167,256\nInferred\nKearney\n402,479\n5.33\n69,020\nJoshua\n283,925\n6.21\n56,648\nTotal Inferred\n686,404\n5.69\n125,668\nNotes:\n1. The Mineral Resource Estimate has been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\n2. To demonstrate Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction (RPEEE), underground Mineral Resources were constrained by Mineable Shape Optimizer (MSO) shapes of 1.2 m minimum stope width optimized to a cut-off of 2.25 g/t Au to demonstrate RPEEE.\n3. Economic parameters for cut-off grade determination: US$1,800 oz Au price, 92% process recovery, 90% payability, 4% royalty, US$120 t mining cost, US$30.72 t processing cost, US$13 t general and administration.\n4. Diluted tonnages and grades are reported based on minimum stope widths.\n5. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources will be converted into Mineral Reserves.\n6. Average density values: mineralized veins = 2.98 t/m3, waste =2.70 t/m3.\n7. Grade interpolation by 2D inverse distance cubed (ID3) using a block size of 5 m (X) by 5 m (Y).\n8. Grade capping for outliers at 80 g/t Au.\n9.\nMineral Resource Classification:\na. Measured - within 20 m of channel samples used in the Mineral Resource estimate or volumes where the average distance to the nearest drill hole is\nb. Indicated - volumes where the average distance to the nearest drill hole is\nc. Inferred - all other interpolated blocks inside the vein wireframes.\n10. Mineral Resources are inclusive of Mineral Reserves.\nFigure 1: Classification of Mineral Resources of Kearney (left) and Joshua (right) veins.\nNote: Block model shows the modelled veins; it has not been constrained by the MSO shapes.\nBy definition, a Mineral Resource has reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction or RPEEE (CIM Definition Standards, 2014). In accordance with the recommendation of the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines 2016, a Mineable Shape Optimizer (MSO) was used to identify spatially continuous mineralization within potentially mineable shapes using reasonable assumptions based on the current operation. The previous 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate did not take into account RPEEE as outlined in the CIM 2016 guidelines, and only considered an economic cut-off on a block-by-block basis.\nThe 2023 MRE updated Joshua and Kearney Mineral Resources have been compared with the non-compliant reserve estimate used in the economic study presented in the technical report titled \"Resource Estimate, Preliminary Economic Assessment & D",

Reported intervals are downhole widths.\n2. The copper equivalent values are estimated using approximate metal prices of $8,350/t copper, $2,480/t zinc, $1,900/oz gold, $23/oz silver and $33,140/t cobalt and are presented for ease of interval comparison only. Metallurgical factors are assumed to be 100% although recovery factors and smelter returns may vary significantly.\n3. True width is estimated at 17.7 metres, based on historical information that the unit dips at approximately 50 degrees. Galantas drilled down dip at 45 degrees intersecting the mineralization at 85 degrees.\nWhile the titanium and vanadium grades are low in this first hole, it indicates their presence within the system and the potential to discover higher grades.\nDrill program\nThis drill hole is part of a program of six holes aiming to test the Kerry Road deposit which has seen limited historical drilling and has never had a resource estimate. The mineralized horizon intercepted in the first hole 23-GL-01 was observed within a quartz carbonate rich unit sandwiched between hornblende schist. The sulphide within this horizon was predominantly massive and semi-massive pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.\nTwo further holes are planned - one which will test the mineralization at a deeper level and a deep hole to test below the current deposit.\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"This is a fantastic result for our first drill hole in Scotland demonstrating significant polymetallic grades. The discovery of new critical minerals is a major development for the project and we look forward to reporting further results as they become available.\"\nFigure 1: Part of a split section of drill core from hole 23-GL-01 showing massive sulphide.\nTable 2: Drill hole locations.\nHole\nEasting\nNorthing\nElevation (m)\nAzimuth (grid)\nDip\nLength (m)\n23-GL-01\n183764\n872517\n139\n260\n-45\n29.2\n23-GL-02\n183816\n872519\n156\n223\n-45\n53.2\n23-GL-03\n183858\n872478\n154\n223\n-45\n65.2\n23-GL-04\n183826\n872440\n142\n43\n-55\n42.8\nProspecting at Gairloch Project\nProspecting has identified multiple massive sulphide horizons in outcrop at newly exposed bedrock from a road cutting 1.5km east of the Kerry Road deposit. Further prospecting will continue along trend towards the Gorm Lochs Prospect which lies 10km south of Kerry Road. Historical samples collected at the Gorm Lochs include up to 4 g/t Au in outcrop (see Galantas' news release dated January 26, 2023).\nFigure 2: Road cutting where new massive sulphide has been observed in bedrock.\nGairloch Project Overview\nThe Kerry Road deposit is a stratabound, Besshi-style, VMS gold-copper-zinc deposit exposed at surface. It is one of the oldest known Besshi deposits, similar in age to the Sherridon district in Manitoba, Canada. The Kerry Road deposit was discovered by Consolidated Goldfields in the 1970s where 87 holes were drilled over 9,189 metres. No commercial exploration has taken place since then until 2018 when drilling by GreenOre Gold PLC (GreenOre) confirmed the presence of mineralization at Kerry Road by intercepting 1.0 g/t gold, 0.9% copper and 0.6% zinc over 17 metres (see Galantas' news release dated January 26, 2023). Rock chip sampling conducted by GreenOre in 2018 also identified elevated levels of cobalt in bedrock.\nThe Kerry Road deposit lies within the Gairloch Schist Belt, a Paleoproterozic volcanic arc terrane extending over 25 km. The unit of interest is a quartz carbonate schist with the main minerals being chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. Limited exploration has been conducted over the ",

Ireland (\"QME\") has successfully concluded its due diligence process at the Company's Omagh Gold Project in Northern Ireland, as part of its work on a sustainable mine plan.\nIt is envisioned that the mine plan, targeted for completion in July 2023, will allow the Company to further develop and mine the ore zones down to the existing lower levels of the Omagh Mine. The mine plan is aimed to optimize production from the dilation zones, which have potential for higher grades and thicker widths of mineralization. The mine plan will outline a staged production plan, estimating the initial production levels, followed by staged expansions of production. The Company believes this will be a lower capital cost pathway of de-risking the growth in production, whilst the Company continues its focus on exploration and expanding its mineral resources at Omagh. The forthcoming mine plan will involve mining both the Joshua and Kearney veins, leveraging QME's highly skilled workforce and state-of-the-art original equipment manufacturer (OEM) mining equipment.\nMario Stifano, CEO of Galantas, commented: \"We are thrilled that QME is progressing our mine plan. QME's extensive mining experience across Europe, including its notable involvement in the development and bulk sampling of Dalradian's nearby gold project located just 20 km away from Omagh, positions them as an ideal partner for this endeavour.\n\"Furthermore, QME's commitment to the success of the Omagh Project is exemplified by its significant shareholding (3,194,444 shares) in Galantas. We look forward to providing further information on our mine strategy next month.\"\nQME was founded in 1985 and is an experienced mining services provider engaged in mine development and the supply of new and re-manufactured equipment for underground and open pit use. QME is currently engaged in mining contracts in Ireland and Portugal and has prior experience in mining projects in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Current and past clients include Tara Mines, Dalradian Gold, Lundin Mining and Barrick Gold.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"UK MAR\") which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Nothing on financial media either. Just like nobody cared about likes of GGP on day one. I'm afraid you only have to look at some of the posts here to see how unsophisticated these UK day traders are, to put it kindly.

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

I also like the company's asset next door in Chile. This Acquisition has put rocket fuel  under  GAL and will drive the company to another level & is a company maker. The shares will IMO ,go much higher on a still re rating but of course there will be small pullbacks as people will take profits bust IMO the share will still go North.",

No mining, just Stifano and his mates sniffing and snouting as much as they can out of the value of the company to its death. It was only a few years ago that 12000 oz of gold a year was being produced, and the underground mine would have allowed the open pit mine to be covered over, processing off site and so the locals would have had the best of both worlds, employment and the end result of countryside being restored. Now neither. Juts a death by dilution cash cow for Sprott and Stifano. Not even a spike to get out.",

Right now this is still in stealth mode because North Americans unable to trade it pending TSX approval, consequently virtually nobody with any kind of following is talking about on financial media/X/Substack - even the mining/gold specialists. Nothing on financial media either. Just like nobody cared about likes of GGP on day one. I'm afraid you only have to look at some of the posts here to see how unsophisticated these UK day traders are, to put it kindly. I don't mean to be condescending but I mean talking about an Islamic bank or fake Helium stock as if they are even playing the same game, let alone in same league. You have to laugh really.",

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

Nothing on financial media either. Just like nobody cared about likes of GGP on day one. I'm afraid you only have to look at some of the posts here to see how unsophisticated these UK day traders are, to put it kindly.

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

          "content": "Galantas Gold Corp is building strong momentum as it advances its portfolio of high-quality gold and copper assets across Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Chile. The company has successfully completed the acquisition of RDL Mining Corp, strengthening its growth pipeline and expanding its resource base. Financially, Galantas is now well funded, having closed a CAD 14.9 million brokered private placement at CAD 0.08 per unit, led by respected firms Canaccord Genuity and Haywood Securities, alongside a CAD 625,000 strategic placement with Ocean Partners UK Ltd to settle outstanding debt. This improves the balance sheet, removes near-term financial overhangs, and aligns the company with a commercial off-take partner. Operationally, Galantas achieved a key technical milestone with the completion of an updated independent mineral resource estimate (MRE) for the Indiana Project in Chile. The project hosts 4.93 million tonnes grading 2.24 g/t gold and 1.31% copper, containing 355,516 ounces of gold and 64,690 tonnes of copper (inferred). The strong grades, continuity of vein systems, and scale of the in-vein resource provide a solid foundation for mine design and the upcoming Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). With funding secured, strategic partnerships in place, and multiple near-term catalysts\u2014including mine design, economic studies, and drilling across at least 21 untested veins\u2014Galantas is well positioned to unlock significant shareholder value. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb7",

Re the copper angle, mainly seems hard up on boundary with teck maybe drill out and do deal with them some time (processing & pit wall constraints wise?), some more old details from lsa times here \u2013 tres perlas towards base of pg 8/16 and indication that veneros is mainly about gold \u2013 I think they were assayed for copper but not seen assays so probably not material enough etc - see near top of pg 9/16 for veneros https://data-api.marketindex.com.au/api/v1/announcements/XASX%3ALSA%3AXX551694/pdf/inline/quarterly-activities-report Overall though imo andacollo is less prospective on a existing vs potential future resources ratio perspective cf Indiana \u2013 now that project can grow big time, andacollo already substantial and the work has been done while project off market in the main \u2013 obviously can go deep but overall that\u2019s my impression.

The company has its new gold/copper asset in Chile and a new acquisition of a past large producing gold mine  with possible copper. This asset comes with all infrastructure built and in place inc ball mill etc. So very near term production also has large ground for exploration as well. IMO. DYOR.",

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

Re the copper angle, mainly seems hard up on boundary with teck maybe drill out and do deal with them some time (processing & pit wall constraints wise?), some more old details from lsa times here \u2013 tres perlas towards base of pg 8/16 and indication that veneros is mainly about gold \u2013 I think they were assayed for copper but not seen assays so probably not material enough etc - see near top of pg 9/16 for veneros https://data-api.marketindex.com.au/api/v1/announcements/XASX%3ALSA%3AXX551694/pdf/inline/quarterly-activities-report Overall though imo andacollo is less prospective on a existing vs potential future resources ratio perspective cf Indiana \u2013 now that project can grow big time, andacollo already substantial and the work has been done while project off market in the main \u2013 obviously can go deep but overall that\u2019s my impression.

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

Nothing on financial media either. Just like nobody cared about likes of GGP on day one. I'm afraid you only have to look at some of the posts here to see how unsophisticated these UK day traders are, to put it kindly. I don't mean to be condescending but I mean talking about an Islamic bank or fake Helium stock as if they are even playing the same game, let alone in same league. You have to laugh really.",

Re the copper angle, mainly seems hard up on boundary with teck maybe drill out and do deal with them some time (processing & pit wall constraints wise?), some more old details from lsa times here \u2013 tres perlas towards base of pg 8/16 and indication that veneros is mainly about gold \u2013 I think they were assayed for copper but not seen assays so probably not material enough etc - see near top of pg 9/16 for veneros https://data-api.marketindex.com.au/api/v1/announcements/XASX%3ALSA%3AXX551694/pdf/inline/quarterly-activities-report Overall though imo andacollo is less prospective on a existing vs potential future resources ratio perspective cf Indiana \u2013 now that project can grow big time, andacollo already substantial and the work has been done while project off market in the main \u2013 obviously can go deep but overall that\u2019s my impression.

This asset comes with all infrastructure built and in place inc ball mill etc. So very near term production also has large ground for exploration as well. IMO. DYOR.",

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

The company has its new gold/copper asset in Chile and a new acquisition of a past large producing gold mine  with possible copper. This asset comes with all infrastructure built and in place inc ball mill etc. So very near term production also has large ground for exploration as well. IMO. DYOR.",

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

Nothing on financial media either. Just like nobody cared about likes of GGP on day one. I'm afraid you only have to look at some of the posts here to see how unsophisticated these UK day traders are, to put it kindly.

Re the copper angle, mainly seems hard up on boundary with teck maybe drill out and do deal with them some time (processing & pit wall constraints wise?), some more old details from lsa times here \u2013 tres perlas towards base of pg 8/16 and indication that veneros is mainly about gold \u2013 I think they were assayed for copper but not seen assays so probably not material enough etc - see near top of pg 9/16 for veneros https://data-api.marketindex.com.au/api/v1/announcements/XASX%3ALSA%3AXX551694/pdf/inline/quarterly-activities-report Overall though imo andacollo is less prospective on a existing vs potential future resources ratio perspective cf Indiana \u2013 now that project can grow big time, andacollo already substantial and the work has been done while project off market in the main \u2013 obviously can go deep but overall that\u2019s my impression.

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

Re the copper angle, mainly seems hard up on boundary with teck maybe drill out and do deal with them some time (processing & pit wall constraints wise?), some more old details from lsa times here \u2013 tres perlas towards base of pg 8/16 and indication that veneros is mainly about gold \u2013 I think they were assayed for copper but not seen assays so probably not material enough etc - see near top of pg 9/16 for veneros https://data-api.marketindex.com.au/api/v1/announcements/XASX%3ALSA%3AXX551694/pdf/inline/quarterly-activities-report Overall though imo andacollo is less prospective on a existing vs potential future resources ratio perspective cf Indiana \u2013 now that project can grow big time, andacollo already substantial and the work has been done while project off market in the main \u2013 obviously can go deep but overall that\u2019s my impression.

Gairloch project \u2013 looking at these - 23-GL-01: 17.9 m @ 2.87% Cu + 0.77 g/t Au, 23-GL-02: 33.0 m @ 1.23% Cu + 1.88 g/t Au, 24-GL-05 (deep): 42.6 m @ 0.94% Cu + 0.42 g/t Au - and comparing \u2013 even globally \u2013 but more specifically eu then uk \u2013 they really stand out, to me at least \u2013 ok nnot true widths = unknown but still - one example link to back up*** \u2013 https://galantas.com/news/galantas-gold-intercepts-17.9-metres-at-2.87-copper-0.77-grams-tonne-gold-0.46-zinc-and-0.03-cobalt-at-gairloch-project-in/ AIMO",

This asset comes with all infrastructure built and in place inc ball mill etc. So very near term production also has large ground for exploration as well. IMO. DYOR.",

They had already been producing 135,000 oz Au at the peak of the mine. I think we will be making a profit quickly when we start the mine up. Also it was operating till 2018, so I do not think that the mine would require too much to get going. They are an open pit mine, so I do not think the require as much to restart as a deep underground mine.....The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. A 7moz + gold resource trading at 100 million market cap!?  All this with tight big holders and directors who will have a massive incentive to perform and get it to production.  Add to that the new president of Chile, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who is generally expected to be more mining-friendly than the outgoing government... His government has emphasized reducing bureaucracy and accelerating permitting for mining projects, aiming to make it easier and faster for companies to develop resources.",

Re the copper angle, mainly seems hard up on boundary with teck maybe drill out and do deal with them some time (processing & pit wall constraints wise?), some more old details from lsa times here \u2013 tres perlas towards base of pg 8/16 and indication that veneros is mainly about gold \u2013 I think they were assayed for copper but not seen assays so probably not material enough etc - see near top of pg 9/16 for veneros https://data-api.marketindex.com.au/api/v1/announcements/XASX%3ALSA%3AXX551694/pdf/inline/quarterly-activities-report Overall though imo andacollo is less prospective on a existing vs potential future resources ratio perspective cf Indiana \u2013 now that project can grow big time, andacollo already substantial and the work has been done while project off market in the main \u2013 obviously can go deep but overall that\u2019s my impression.
