Each Unit is comprised of one common share of nil par value (\"Galantas Share\") and one Galantas Share purchase warrant (each, a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share at a price of $0.12 for a period of 36 months from the date hereof.\nMario Stifano, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, participated in the Brokered Offering for 400,000 Units, purchasing these Units at the Offering Price for a total consideration of $32,000 (the \"Stifano Participation\"). George Duguay, an officer of the Company, also participated in the Brokered Offering for 500,000 Units at the Offering Price for a total consideration of $40,000.\nMr Stifano is deemed a related party to the Company for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies, and the Stifano Participation is considered a related-party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies.

The Company received notification on January 20, 2026, that on November 25, 2022, Mr Stifano sold 1,375 Galantas Shares at an average price of $0.53.\nFollowing the Stifano Participation\nand the aforementioned disclosures\n, Mr Stifano holds 641,278 Galantas Shares, representing approximately 0.14% of the Company's issued share capital.\nAbout Galantas Gold Corporation\nGalantas Gold Corporation is a publicly traded gold company focused on the acquisition, development, and advancement of gold assets in stable mining jurisdictions. The Company is currently advancing the Indiana Gold-Copper Project in Chile, an advanced-stage project with a substantial historical resource base.

The Project is a past-producing, large-scale open pit heap leach gold operation with existing infrastructure, permits, and extensive historical technical data. The acquisition represents a significant strategic step for Galantas and is expected to constitute a\u00a0Fundamental Acquisition\u00a0under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (\"\nTSXV\n\").\nAndacollo Oro Gold Project Overview\nThe Project is located in the Coquimbo Region, Chile, approximately 55 kilometres southeast of the coastal city of La Serena, at a low elevation of 1,100 metres. The Project includes a\nsubstantial permitted footprint with\u00a0mining concessions, land title, and water rights\u00a0in place. Extensive earthworks, mine infrastructure, and three leach pads remain on site with excellent access to infrastructure, services, and a skilled workforce.\nA\nhistorical mineral resource estimate(1)(2) for the Project estimates its measured and indicated mineral resources at an aggregate of 2.02 million (M) ounces (oz) of gold (Au), consisting of 130M tonnes (t) at 0.48 Au grams per tonne\n(g/t) and estimates its inferred mineral resources at\n5.06M oz Au, consisting of 358Mt at 0.45 Au g/t\n.\nThe historical mineral resource estimate\u00a0is derived from the\u00a0National Instrument 43-101\nStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\n(\"\nNI 43-101\n\") technical report titled \"\nCMID SPA, Andacollo Oro, Chile, Technical Report\"\nprepared by GEOINVEST SAC E.I.R.L. Chile, with an effective date of August 23, 2021 (the \"\nHistorical Report\n\").\nThe Historical Report states that the Project operated as a\u00a020,000 tonne per day (tpd) open pit heap leach operation, producing a cumulative\u00a01.12M oz Au between 1998 and 2018, with peak annual production of approximately\u00a0135,000 oz Au.\nGeologically, the Project hosts a\u00a0low-sulphidation epithermal, manto-style gold system. The deposit has been extensively evaluated by past operators, with\u00a01,600 drill holes completed for a total of approximately 190,000 metres, providing a robust technical database underpinning multiple historical studies and resource estimates.\nThe Project is adjacent to the producing Carmen del Andacollo porphyry copper mine (the \"\nCDA Mine\n\"), operated by Teck Resources Limited (\"\nTeck\n\"), which produces about 45,000 tonnes of copper per year. See \"Adjacent Property Disclosure\" below.\nMario Stifano, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented:\n\"This transaction represents a clear step-change in the scale and profile of Galantas. The acquisition of the Andacollo Oro Gold Project fundamentally repositions the Company, adding a large-scale, past-producing gold asset with existing infrastructure, permits, and a deep technical database in one of Chile's most established mining districts.\nWith an Adsorption-Desorption-Recovery plant at 200,000 oz per annum nameplate capacity, the Project provides Galantas with multiple development pathways and a level of optionality that is rarely available in a single transaction, while the staged consideration structure reflects our commitment to capital discipline and risk management. The Project has significant exploration potential for both additional gold and copper mineralization.\nImportantly, this acquisition complements our ongoing work at the Indiana Gold-Copper Project, where a Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway and drilling is planned for the first quarter of 2026. Together, these assets mark an evolution of Galantas from a single-asset company into a multi-asset platform, positioning the Company for disciplined growth and long-term value creation.\"\nTransaction Structure and Related-Party Disclosure\nThe Transaction will be effected by way of the Agreement, pursuant to which Galantas will acquire\u00a0100% of the shares of Sol de Oro Mining Ltd. (\"\nSol\n\"), which in turn owns\u00a0100% of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera OXI SpA (\"\nOXI\n\"). OXI has purchased 100% of the shares of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera e Inmobiliaria Dragones SpA (\"\nDragones\n\"), the owner of the Project, pursuant to certain share purchase agreements dated January 6, 2026 with the former Dragones shareholders (the \"\nDragones Agreements\n\"). All former Dragones shareholders are arm's length to OXI, Sol and Galantas. If the payments described below are not completed to the former Dragones shareholders, such shares will be transferred back to the former shareholders with any partial payments forfeited. Sol and OXI were established as dedicated transaction vehicles to consolidate ownership and facilitate the acquisition of the Project.\nA summary of Sol's financial information on a consolidated basis (which includes both OXI and Dragones) as at and for the year ended December 31, 2025, is as follows:\nTotal (US$)\nTotal (GBP)\nTotal Assets\n4,275,908\n3,168,918\nTotal Liabilities\n4,343,429\n3,218,958\nRevenue\n-\n-\nProfit / (Losses)\n(67,521)\n(50,040)\nSol is owned 100% by Robert Sedgemore, who is an executive officer of Galantas and is a Non-Arm's Length Party as defined in the TSXV policies in relation to Galantas. As a result, the Transaction constitutes a\u00a0\"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101\nProtection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions\n(\"\nMI 61-101\n\") and TSXV policies. The terms of the Transaction were negotiated on a commercial basis. In considering the Transaction, the board of directors of Galantas reviewed the Project's historical production performance, technical information, jurisdictional profile, and comparable transaction metrics, and determined that the Transaction is\u00a0in the best interests of the Company. The Company relied on exemptions from the formal valuation of MI 61-101 as no securities of the Company are listed or quoted on certain specified exchanges. The Transaction has received\u00a0full board approval\u00a0and will be subject to all required regulatory approvals, including minority approval requirements of MI 61-101. No finder fees were paid in relation to the Transaction.\nRobert Sedgemore is deemed a related party to the Company for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies, and the Sol Payment (as defined below) is considered a related-party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Accordingly, the directors of the Company, who are all considered independent of the Sol Payment, having consulted with their Nominated Adviser, consider the terms of the Sol Payment to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nConsideration and Payment Terms\nSubject to TSXV approval, the total\u00a0cash consideration\u00a0payable under the Agreement and the Dragones Agreements is\u00a0US$32.0 million, structured as staged payments over four years to align with development planning and capital discipline.\nThe cash consideration is payable as follows:\n\u00b7\nOn closing of the Transaction (the \"\nClosing\n\"):\u00a0US$4.5 million, comprised of:\no\nthe assumption of debts held by OXI and Sol, which is approximately US$3.0 million; and\no\nUS$1.5 million payable to the Sol shareholder, Robert Sedgemore, as consideration for 100% of the shares of Sol (the \"\nSol Payment\n\").\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2026:\u00a0US$3.5 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2027:\u00a0US$4.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2028:\u00a0US$6.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\n\u00b7\nOn December 31, 2029:\u00a0US$14.0 million payable to the Dragones shareholders.\nIn addition to the cash consideration, on Closing,\u00a0Luis Catril, the controlling shareholder of Dragones, will receive\u00a091,313,890 common shares of Galantas (representing 19.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Galantas as of January 6, 2026), subject to TSXV approval and Galantas shareholder approval, excluding Robert Sedgemore as a connected party to the Transaction.\nThe common shares to be issued to Mr. Catril will be issued at a\u00a0deemed price equal to the market price of the Company's shares in accordance with TSXV policies\u00a0and are expected to be subject to\u00a0applicable resale restrictions and escrow requirements, if any, as determined by the TSXV.\nThe Company expects to fund the cash consideration from a combination of future financing and/or working capital.\nK2 Resources Inc. (\"\nK2\n\") and ExGen Resources Inc. (\"\nExGen\n\") hold silver streams on the Property, each requiring delivery of 33.4% and 66.6%, respectively, of each payable ounce of silver produced at the Property to K2 and ExGen until the payment of 333,334 ounces of silver to K2 and 666,667 of silver to ExGen is complete, and after which 16.7% and 33.3%, respectively, of each ounce of payable silver produced at the Property will be delivered to each of K2 and ExGen.\nFurther information on the Project\nThe Project represents a rare opportunity to acquire a\u00a0large-scale, brownfield gold asset\u00a0with a long operating history,\u00a0existing infrastructure, and a\u00a0fully permitted footprint\u00a0in a stable and well-established mining jurisdiction. Unlike greenfield projects, the Project benefits from historical mine development, processing facilities, and infrastructure already in place, materially reducing development complexity and capital costs.\nThe Project is a\u00a0past-producing open pit heap leach operation with proven metallurgy, having historically operated at commercial scale for more than two decades. The Project has been non-operational since 2015. Mining methods, metallurgical performance, and processing routes are well understood based on extensive historical operating data, significantly reducing technical uncertainty relative to earlier-stage assets.\nThe Project hosts a historical mineral resource base, supported by a large drilling database and multiple historical technical studies. In addition, significant mineralized material remains on site, including material placed on existing leach pads, providing a tangible foundation for staged evaluation and development activities.\nFrom a development perspective, the combination of\u00a0existing infrastructure, valid permits, historical production, historical mineral resource estimates, and proven processing methods\u00a0provides a clear pathway to evaluate opportunities to\u00a0advance the Project on an accelerated timeline toward potential production, subject to completion of updated technical studies and regulatory approvals.\nHistorical Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates(1)(2)\nThe following\u00a0historical mineral resource estimate is derived from the Historical Report.\nClassification\nTonnes (Mt)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nContained Gold (Moz Au)\nMeasured + Indicated\n130.0\n0.48\n2.02\nInferred\n358.0\n0.45\n5.06\nTotal\n488.0\n0.46\n7.08\nThe Historical Report also identifies the following historical mineral reserve estimate, contained within the measured and indicated mineral resources:\nClassification\nTonnes (Mt)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nContained Gold (Moz Au)\nProbable\n40.74\n0.64\n0.83\nNotes:\n1\nThe Company considers the historical estimates to be relevant as they provide an indication of the potential of the Project. However, a qualified person of Galantas has not done sufficient work to classify these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and Galantas is not treating these historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Galantas has not verified this information and is not relying on it. To verify the historical mineral resource estimate, Galantas will need to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate and NI 43-101 technical report with respect to the Project (the \"\nNew Report\n\"). Galantas is currently preparing the New Report and intends to file it on SEDAR+ upon the completion of the Transaction in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and applicable securities laws.\n2 The historical mineral resource estimate considers resources optimized in a global open-pit shell using a gold price of US$1,750 per oz Au, and a cut-off grade of 0.15 g/t Au. The historical mineral reserve estimate was based on a gold price of US$1,550 per oz Au, and a cut-off grade of 0.20 g/t Au.\nExploration Opportunities\nThe Project has significant exploration upside, as noted in the Historical Report. Drilling to date has been mostly vertical, leading to opportunities for grade enhancement by angle-drilling vertical and near-vertical higher-grade feeder structures. There is significant potential to increase resources by exploration along strike and down-dip of known mineralization. Additionally, there is a possibility of porphyry-style gold-copper mineralization extending from Teck's adjacent CDA Mine onto the Project with drilling in 2011 between the Project and CDA Mine pits returning up to 30 metres of 0.53% copper. However, this is not guaranteed. See \"Adjacent Property Disclosure\" below.\nThere are also indications of a chalcocite enriched copper blanket in the transition zone between oxide and sulfide at the Project, which would represent a high-grade copper target in its own right. Finally, there are numerous gold-copper occurrences on the Project which have not been adequately explored and evaluated, as well as similar occurrences and operating small-scale mines on adjacent ground.\nAdjacent Property Disclosure\nAs discussed in this news release, the Project is located adjacent to the CDA Mine operated by Teck. The Company does not hold, and has no right to acquire, any interest in the CDA Mine. Mineralization and production on adjacent or nearby properties are not necessarily indicative of mineralization or future production, costs, or economic results at the Project. Information in relation Teck has been sourced from www.teck.com.\nConditions to Closing\nCompletion of the Transaction is subject to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nTSXV approval, including approval of the Transaction as a\u00a0Fundamental Acquisition.\n\u00b7\nSatisfaction of all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\u00b7\nReceipt of required shareholder approvals, including minority approval requirements of MI 61-101.\n\u00b7\nCompletion of customary closing conditions.\nApproval of Board of Directors for the Agreement\nAfter consultation with its legal advisors, the board of directors of Galantas unanimously approved the entering into of the Agreement.\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical disclosures in this news release have been reviewed and approved by\u00a0Mr. Gavin Berkenheger, who is considered, by virtue of his education, experience, and professional association, to be a\u00a0Qualified Person\u00a0and\u00a0independent\u00a0for the purposes of\u00a0NI 43-101.\nNeither the TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nThe information contained in this announcement is deemed to constitute\u00a0inside information\u00a0as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the\u00a0Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\u00a0(the \"\nUK MAR\n\"), which forms part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The quality, grade profile and continuity of the vein systems, together with the scale of the in-vein resource, provide a solid foundation as we advance mine design and commence the PEA. With financing closed and a commercial off-take partner secured, we are well positioned to systematically advance the project while continuing to evaluate opportunities to enhance value through drilling to explore at least 21 untested veins.\"\nCompletion of the Transaction\nThe acquisition of RDL provides Galantas with an option (the \"\nOption\n\") to acquire a 100% interest in the Indiana gold/copper project located in Chile (the \"\nIndiana Project\n\"), by meeting certain conditions, pursuant to an option agreement between Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera RDL SpA (\"\nRDL SpA\n\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RDL, and Miner\u00eda Indiana Limitada dated October 30, 2025. Additional details of the Option are included in Galantas' press releases dated November 13, 2025, November 21, 2025, and December 19, 2025.\nAs consideration under the Transaction, each RDL Shareholder received approximately 44 million Galantas Shares, for an aggregate of approximately 132 million Galantas Shares. Each RDL Shareholder holds Galantas Shares representing approximately 10% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares following the completion of the Transaction and the Offerings. As additional consideration under the Transaction, each RDL Shareholder was granted a 0.66% net smelter return (\"\nNSR\n\") royalty payable by Galantas in respect of the Indiana Project, for an aggregate NSR royalty of approximately 2.0%.\nIn connection with the Transaction, Lawrence Roulston was appointed to the board of directors of Galantas (the \"\nGalantas Board\n\"). The Galantas Board is now comprised of six members, being Mario Stifano, R\u00f3is\u00edn Magee, James Clancy, David Cather, Brent Omland (existing directors of Galantas) and Lawrence Roulston (a new director and a former RDL Shareholder). In addition, Robert Sedgemore was appointed as Senior Vice President, Operations, of Galantas.\nCompletion of the Offerings\nThe Company completed the Brokered Offering of 186,250,000 Units for aggregate gross proceeds of $14,900,000. Each Unit is comprised of one Galantas Share and one Galantas Share purchase warrant (each, a \"\nWarrant\n\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share at a price of $0.12 for a period of 36 months from the date hereof.\nAs compensation for their services, the Company: (i) paid to the Agents a cash commission of $1,042,750 representing 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Offerings (including gross proceeds from the Agents' over-allotment option), reduced to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of $1,100,000 from certain purchasers\non the president's list agreed to between the Company and Canaccord Genuity\nCorp.

Each Compensation Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share for the Offering Price for a period of 24 months from the date hereof.\nA separate cash finder's fee of $77,000.00 was paid to Harbourfront Wealth Management Inc., representing 7.0% of the gross proceeds from investors introduced to the Company by Harbourfront Wealth Management Inc. as consideration for finding and introducing such investors to the Company.\nThe net proceeds from the Offerings will be used to fund exploration work on the Indiana Project, to fund payments in connection with the Option for the Indiana Project, and for general corporate and working capital purposes.\nCertain \"Insiders\" of the Company (as such term is defined under the policies of the TSXV) purchased an aggregate of 10,900,000 Units in the Offerings, which is considered a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101\nProtection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions\n(\"\nMI\n61-101\n\"). The Company relied on the exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 based on a determination that the fair market value of the Offerings, insofar as it involves the Insiders, does not exceed 25% of the market capitalization of the Company.\nOcean Partners participated in the Brokered Offering for 35,937,500 Units and in the Non-Brokered Offering for 7,812,500 Shares resulting in Ocean Partners becoming an Insider of the Company. Eric Sprott (through 2176423 Ontario Ltd.) participated in the Brokered Offering for 50,000,000 Units becoming an Insider of the Company. Following the completion of the Transaction and the Offerings, Ocean Partners and Eric Sprott held approximately 10.7% and 13.1% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares, respectively.\nNo new \"Control Persons\" (as such term is defined under the policies of the TSXV) were created in connection with the Offerings. In addition, the Warrants restrict any holder from exercising any Warrants that would result in any holder owning or controlling 20% or more of the then issued and outstanding Galantas Shares (calculated on a partially diluted basis).\nThe securities offered have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nAny securities issued under the Offerings will be subject to a hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, expiring four months and one day following the date hereof.\nUpdated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate - Indiana Project\nThe updated mineral resource estimate contained in the Technical Report (titled \"\nMineral Resource Estimate, Indiana Project, Atacama Region, Chile\n\" with an effective date of December 9, 2025 and prepared by DRA in accordance with NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards) and is reported on an in-vein basis across seven principal vein systems. Mineral resources are constrained by reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction and reported using gold equivalent (AuEq) cut-off grades of 0.99 g/t AuEq for sulphide material and 0.95 g/t AuEq for oxide material.\nTable 1 - 2025 Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate (Indiana Project - December 9, 2025)\nCategory\nTonnes (000s)\nAu (g/t)\nCu (%)\nContained Au (oz)\nContained Cu (t)\nInferred\n4,932\n2.24\n1.31\n355,516\n64,690\nNotes:\n1. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves.\n2. AuEq cut-offs are based on assumed gold price of US$3,200/oz and copper price of US$4.70/lb, with metallurgical recoveries and operating cost assumptions detailed in the Technical Report.\n3. There are no known legal, political, environmental or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources.\n4. Numbers may not add due to rounding.\nResource Upside and Mine Model Refinement\nDRA notes that the 2025 mineral resource estimate is restricted to in-vein mineralization only and does not include mineralized halos surrounding the veins. The presence and continuity of halo mineralization have been validated by historical drilling and underground sampling; however, this material has not been incorporated into the current estimate as the updated geological and block modelling for halo domains has not yet been completed.\nDRA further notes that inclusion of halo material in future resource updates, subject to completion of the updated geological modelling, appropriate drilling density and engineering validation, may result in changes to tonnage and mine planning assumptions and provide additional mine planning flexibility.\nThe Company intends to incorporate halo mineralization into the updated geological and mine model currently being developed as part of the PEA, subject to validation through additional drilling, geological interpretation and engineering analysis.\nThe Technical Report will be filed by the Company on SEDAR+ on the date of this news release and is available to view below.\nClick on, or paste the following link into your web browser, to view the associated PDF document.\nhttps://galantas.com/site/assets/files/8836/technical_report.pdf\nProject Advancement: Mine Design and Off-Take\nGalantas intends to commence formal mine design activities and preparation of the PEA.\nPlanned work programs include resource definition drilling and geotechnical drilling designed to support underground mine design, stope geometry, ground support assumptions and infrastructure layout, together with mine engineering, scheduling and cost estimation activities required to support the PEA. The PEA will include an evaluation of mining methods, processing options, infrastructure, capital and operating cost estimates, and economic sensitivities, subject to the limitations inherent in a preliminary-level study.

(\"\nRDL\n\") and its previously announced private placement (the \"\nOffering\n\") of units of the Company (each, a \"\nUnit\n\"), for $0.08 per Unit (the \"\nOffering Price\n\"), led by Canaccord Genuity Corp. and Haywood Securities Inc. (together, the \"\nAgents\n\").\nThe Company is working diligently to satisfy remaining closing conditions, including obtaining approval of the Transaction from the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"\nTSXV\n\"), and both the Offering and the Transaction are expected to be completed during 2025. Trading in the common shares of Galantas (\"\nCommon Shares\n\") is currently halted in accordance with TSXV Policy 5.3.\nClarification of the RDL Option\nOnce the Transaction is completed, Galantas (indirectly through RDL) will hold an option (the \"\nOption\n\") to acquire a 100% interest in the Indiana gold/copper project located in Chile (the \"\nIndiana Project\n\"). In order to exercise the Option, RDL must make payments totaling US$15 million to Miner\u00eda Indiana Limitada (\"\nIndiana Limitada\n\"), the current owner of the Indiana Project, over a period of five years, with the first payment of US$500,000 paid in the fourth quarter of 2025. The remaining payments consist of US$1 million in years one and two, US$2 million in years three and four and a final payment of US$8.5 million in year five (together, the \"\nOption Payments\n\").\nUntil RDL has exercised the Option, RDL will \"lease\" the Indiana Project from Indiana Limitada in exchange for payments as follows:\n\u00b7\nIf the Indiana Project is in production, the monthly payment is equivalent to 10% of the net sales of minerals from the mining concessions.\n\u00b7\nIf the Indiana Project is not in production, the monthly payment based on net sales will not be paid, and the minimum payment below will be paid.\n\u00b7\nOn an annual basis, the minimum payment required is 25% of the Option Payment due for that year, and the maximum payment required is 50% of the Option Payment due for that year.\n\u00b7\nIf the Indiana Project is not in production, minimum payments will still be payable on an annual basis. As soon as the Option Payments are paid in full, RDL will no longer need to make any lease payments.\nSuch payments are made in exchange for access to the Indiana Project and are not credited as Option Payments.\nHistorical Mineral Resources\nThe Company would like to clarify and restate certain technical information previously provided in respect of the 2013 Technical Report (as defined below), which was included in the Company's press release dated November 13, 2025. See below for the corrected information.\nA historical inferred mineral resource estimate for the Indiana Project1 outlines approximately 714,600 ounces of gold equivalent (AuEq)2, consisting of approximately 4,546,300 tonnes, averaging 4.89 parts per million (ppm) AuEq, supported by a technical report (the \"\n2013 Technical Report\n\") prepared for Minera Activa SpA in accordance with National Instrument 43-101\nStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\n(\"\nNI 43-101\n\").\nThe historical inferred mineral resource estimate2 for the Indiana Project is contained in the table

Company considers the historical estimate to be relevant as it provides an indication of the mineral potential of the Indiana Project. However, a qualified person of Galantas has not done sufficient work to classify this historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and Galantas is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Galantas has not verified this information and is not relying on it. To verify the historical estimate, Galantas will need to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate and NI 43-101 technical report with respect to the Indiana Project (the \"\nNew Technical Report\n\"). Galantas is currently preparing the New Technical Report and intends to file it on SEDAR+ upon the completion of the Transaction in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and applicable securities laws.\nSince the date of the 2013 Technical Report, additional exploration has been conducted on the Indiana Project. Approximately 1,500 meters of exploitation and exploration drifts have been excavated, mapped and sampled. In addition, approximately 960 meters of core was drilled in 2020.\nOffering Update\nThe Company intends to rely on the \"part and parcel pricing exception\" provided for in the corporate finance policies of the TSXV in relation to gross proceeds raised that are specifically allocated and necessary for the Transaction, being $10 million (the \"\nTransaction Funds\n\"). The Offering Price for any non-Transaction Funds raised under the Offering may need to be adjusted after the Common Shares resume trading, and therefore closing of the Offering relating to any non-Transaction Funds will occur at least two business days after the Common Shares resume trading. Any adjustments to all or a portion of the Offering will require the approval of the TSXV and will be announced via a subsequent press release.\nThe securities offered under the Offering have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nNotes\n[1]\n\"\nTechnical Report Indiana Gold and Copper Project Region III Chile\n\" dated December 9, 2013, prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 by Dr. Eduardo Magri for Activa.\n2\nGold equivalency based on the following prices: gold US$1,100/oz, copper US$2.80/lb, molybdenum US$12/lb, and adjusted for the following recovery rates: gold 75%, copper 88%, molybdenum 60% (\ne.g.\n, 1 pound copper = (1 x $2.80) / $1,100 x (88% / 75%) AuEq). Areas, tonnages and metal content are rounded to the nearest hundred square metres, tonnes and ounces, respectively; vein thickness is rounded to the nearest centimetre, grades are rounded to two decimal places. Rounding may result in apparent differences between tonnes, grade and metal content. Inferred mineral resources were estimated as a global inferred geological resource using a vein accumulation methodology base on true widths, with grades estimated using Sichel't estimation due to limited data density. No cut-off grade was applied to the inferred mineral resource estimate.\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical disclosures in this news release have been reviewed and approved by Mr. Gavin Berkenheger, who is considered, by virtue of his education, experience and professional association, a \"qualified person\" and independent under the terms of NI 43-101.\nNeither TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"\nUK MAR\n\") which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Dollars)\n(Unaudited)\n1.\nIncorporation and Nature of Operations\nGalantas Gold Corporation (the \"Company\") was formed on September 20, 1996 under the name Montemor Resources Inc. on the amalgamation of 1169479 Ontario Inc. and Consolidated Deer Creek Resources Limited. The name was changed to European Gold Resources Inc. by articles of amendment dated July 25, 1997. On May 5, 2004, the Company changed its name from European Gold Resources Inc. to Galantas Gold Corporation. The Company was incorporated to explore for and develop mineral resource properties, principally in Europe. In 1997, it purchased all of the shares of Omagh Minerals Limited (\"Omagh\") which owns a mineral property in Northern Ireland, including a delineated gold deposit. Omagh obtained full planning and environmental consents necessary to bring its property into production.\nThe Company entered into an agreement on April 17, 2000, approved by shareholders on June 26, 2000, whereby Cavanacaw Corporation (\"Cavanacaw\"), a private Ontario corporation, acquired Omagh. Cavanacaw has established an open pit mine to extract the Company's gold deposit near Omagh, Northern Ireland. Cavanacaw also has developed a premium jewellery business founded on the gold produced under the name Gal\u00e1ntas Irish Gold Limited (\"Gal\u00e1ntas\"). As at July 1, 2007, the Company's Omagh mine began production and in 2013 production was suspended. On April 1, 2014, Gal\u00e1ntas amalgamated its jewelry business with Omagh.\nOn April 8, 2014, Cavanacaw acquired Flintridge Resources Limited (\"Flintridge\"). Following a strategic review of its business by the Company during 2014 certain assets owned by Omagh were acquired by Flintridge.\nOn November 16, 2023, Gairloch Resources Limited (\"Gairloch\") was incorporated.\nOn September 23, 2025, the Company sold 80% interest in Flintridge and 80% in Omagh, subsidiaries of Galantas which together own the Omagh Project (the \"Transaction\"). The remaining 20% interest in Flintridge and 20% interest in Omagh will be retained by Galantas. Refer to note 6.\nThe Company's operations include the consolidated results of Gairloch, Cavanacaw, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Omagh, Gal\u00e1ntas and Flintridge. For Omagh and Flintridge the results are included up to the September 23, 2025 (date of loss of control).\nThe Company's common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (\"TSXV\") and London Stock Exchange AIM under the symbol GAL. On September 1, 2021, the Company's common shares started trading under the symbol GALKF on the OTCQX in the United States. The primary office is located at The Canadian Venture Building, 82 Richmond Street East, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5C 1P1.\n2.\nGoing Concern\nThese unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but is not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period. Management is aware, in making its assessment, of uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's future viability depends on the consolidated results of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries Gairloch which incorporated on November 16, 2023 and Cavanacaw. Cavanacaw had a 100% shareholding in Gal\u00e1ntas, Flintridge who are engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of gold properties, mainly in Omagh, Northern Ireland and Omagh who is engaged in the exploration of gold properties, mainly in the Republic of Ireland. The Omagh mine is an open pit mine, which was in production until 2013 when production was suspended and is reported as property, plant and equipment and as an underground mine which having established technical feasibility and commercial viability in December 2018 has resulted in associated exploration and evaluation assets being reclassified as an intangible development asset and reported as property, plant and equipment. On September 23, 2025, Cavanacaw lost control of Flintridge and Omagh (refer to note 6).\nThe going concern assumption is dependent on forecast cash flows being met, further financing negotiations being completed successfully. Management' assumptions in relation to future financing, levels of production, gold prices and mine operating costs are crucial to forecast cash flows being achieved. Should production be significantly delayed, revenues fall short of expectations or operating costs and capital costs increase significantly, there may be insufficient cash flows to sustain day to day operations without seeking further financing.\nBased on the financial projections which have been prepared for a five-year period and using assumptions which management believes to be prudent, alongside ongoing negotiations with both current and prospective investors and creditors, management believes it is appropriate to prepare the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis.\nShould the Company be unsuccessful in securing the above, there would be significant uncertainty over the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if forecast cash flows were not achieved, if the existing creditors withdrew their support or if further financing could not be raised from current or potential investors.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company raised gross proceeds of $1.1M through loans from related parties.\nAs at September 30, 2025, the Company had a deficit of $87,460,832 (December 31, 2024 - $80,520,994). Comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $8,764,497 (nine months ended September 30, 2024 - $1,849,549). These conditions raise material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt as to whether the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. However, management believes that it will continue as a going concern. However, this is subject to a number of uncertainties detailed above. These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not reflect adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and financial position classifications used that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not appropriate. These adjustments could be material.\n3.\nBasis of Preparation and Material Accounting Policies\nStatement of compliance\nThe Company applies IFRS\u00ae Accounting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\"). These unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 - Interim Financial Reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements.\nThe policies applied in these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements are based on IFRS issued and outstanding as of November 27, 2025 the date the Board of Directors approved the statements. The same accounting policies and methods of computation are followed in these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements as compared with the most recent annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2024, except as noted below. Any subsequent changes to IFRS that are given effect in the Company's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2025 could result in restatement of these unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment in associate\nThe Company's investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and its share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from the associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\nWhen the Company's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables from the associate, the Company does not recognize further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or the Company is contractually required to fund these additional losses.\nThe carrying amount of the investment in associate is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, the carrying amount of the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\nUnrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Company and an associate are eliminated to the extent of the Company's interest in the associate.\nThe Company's share of its associate's post-acquisition results is shown on the face of the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss and other comprehensive (loss) income, and its share of movements in reserves is recognized directly in equity.\n4.\nAccounts Receivable and Prepaid Expenses\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nSales tax receivable - Canada\n$\n13,870\n$\n13,225\nValued added tax receivable - Northern Ireland\n-\n61,414\nAccounts receivable\n-\n69,806\nPrepaid expenses\n175,662\n219,917\n$\n189,532\n$\n364,362\nPrepaid expenses includes advances for consumables and for construction of the passing bays in the Omagh mine. Prepaid expenses includes also $166,667 (December 31, 2024 - $111,111) pursuant to services agreement for the underground development at the Omagh Gold Project. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, prepaid expenses were written-up by $nil and $55,556, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\u00a0- $nil) to reflect anticipated value of associated services to be received in future.

(\"Ocean Partners\") completed the exchange of its existing loans, totalling approximately US$14 million ($19.7 million), for an 80% interest in Flintridge and Omagh, subsidiaries of Galantas that collectively own the Omagh Project. As a result, Galantas retains a 20% interest in each subsidiary.\nAs part of the transaction, Ocean Partners has provided an initial capital investment of US$3 million ($4,176,300). These funds are allocated toward exploration, restart planning, and general and administrative costs during the first phase of the joint venture, referred to as the Initial Term. Galantas is free carried during this period. Ocean Partners has also confirmed its option to provide an additional US$5 million ($6,960,500) in a second phase (the \"Second Term\"), which will be directed toward further exploration and the commissioning of a development program. Galantas retains the option to participate pro-rata in this future funding.\nIn connection with the Transaction, a shareholders' agreement has been executed, appointing Ocean Partners as operator of the Omagh Project. The Board of Directors of Flintridge will consist of four representatives nominated by Ocean Partners and one representative nominated by Galantas, for so long as Galantas maintains at least a 10% interest in Flintridge.\nDuring the Initial Term, Galantas holds the right to convert its 20% equity interest in Flintridge into a 3.00% Net Smelter Return (\"NSR\") royalty. Half of this royalty would be subject to buy-back by Flintridge for US$8 million ($11,319,606). If Galantas does not exercise this option and its ownership in Flintridge is subsequently diluted below 10%, its equity interest will automatically convert into a 1.50% NSR, with half of that amount subject to buy-back for US$4 million ($5,568,400).\nThe Company assessed that it no longer had control of Flintridge as of the closing date but retained significant influence. The Company is accounting for the retained investment as an investment in associate in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. In accordance with IAS 28, the fair value of the retained investment is the deemed cost of the investment in associate as at the closing date. A loss has been recognized in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive (loss) income, which is calculated as the difference between the closing date fair value of the retained investment and the carrying amount of the former subsidiaries net assets.\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nFair value of retained investment\n$\n5,954,818\n$\n-\nCarrying amount of former subsidiaries net assets (notes 7, 8, 9 and 15)\n(11,319,606\n)\n-\nReclassification of foreign currency translation reserve\n2,479,125\n-\nLoss on disposal of interest in subsidiaries\n$\n(2,885,663\n)\n$\n-\nInvestment in associates\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n-\nAdditions (fair value of retained investment)\n5,954,818\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n5,954,818\n7.\u00a0Property, Plant and Equipment\nFreehold\nPlant\nland and\nand\nMotor\nOffice\nDevelopment\nAssets under\nCost\nbuildings\nmachinery\nvehicles\nequipment\nassets\nconstruction\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n2,323,111\n$\n8,995,926\n$\n227,835\n$\n222,845\n$\n20,640,066\n$\n26,939\n$\n32,436,722\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,555,601\n-\n2,555,601\nTransfer\n-\n28,928\n-\n-\n-\n(28,928\n)\n-\nCash receipts from concentrate sales\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(1,228,232\n)\n-\n(1,228,232\n)\nReversal of impairment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3,250,867\n-\n3,250,867\nForeign exchange adjustment\n164,468\n634,400\n16,130\n15,776\n1,548,305\n1,989\n2,381,068\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n2,487,579\n9,659,254\n243,965\n238,621\n26,766,607\n-\n39,396,026\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,866,876\n-\n1,866,876\nCash receipts from concentrate sales (note 14)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(787,929\n)\n-\n(787,929\n)\nDisposals of interest in subsidiaries (note 6)\n(2,580,299\n)\n(9,984,217\n)\n(253,058\n)\n(247,515\n)\n(28,651,230\n)\n-\n(41,716,319\n)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n92,720\n324,963\n9,093\n8,894\n805,676\n-\n1,241,346\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nAccumulated depreciation\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n1,939,409\n$\n7,061,856\n$\n181,541\n$\n159,745\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n9,342,551\nDepreciation\n3,298\n407,802\n13,975\n9,837\n-\n-\n434,912\nForeign exchange adjustment\n137,399\n509,830\n13,272\n11,606\n-\n-\n672,107\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n2,080,106\n7,979,488\n208,788\n181,188\n-\n-\n10,449,570\nDepreciation\n2,079\n257,249\n8,254\n6,589\n-\n-\n274,171\nDisposal of interest in subsidiaries (note 6)\n(2,159,755\n)\n(8,503,607\n)\n(224,969\n)\n(194,646\n)\n-\n-\n(11,082,977\n)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n77,570\n266,870\n7,927\n6,869\n-\n-\n359,236\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nCarrying value\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n407,473\n$\n1,679,766\n$\n35,177\n$\n57,433\n$\n26,766,607\n$\n-\n$\n28,946,456\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n8.\nExploration and Evaluation Assets\nAcquisition\nExploration\nCost\ncosts\ncosts\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n3,636,294\n$\n4,776,409\nAdditions\n-\n481,338\n481,338\nForeign exchange adjustment\n-\n229,449\n229,449\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n1,140,115\n4,347,081\n5,487,196\nAdditions\n-\n395,382\n395,382\nDisposal of interest in subsidiaries (note 6)\n-\n(4,243,418\n)\n(4,243,418\n)\nForeign exchange adjustment\n-\n140,330\n140,330\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n639,375\n$\n1,779,490\nCarrying value\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n4,347,081\n$\n5,487,196\nBalance, September 30, 2025\n$\n1,140,115\n$\n639,375\n$\n1,779,490\n9.\u00a0Decommissioning Liability\nThe Company's decommissioning liability is a result of mining activities at the Omagh mine in Northern Ireland. The Company estimated its decommissioning liability at September 30, 2025 based on a risk-free discount rate of 1% (December 31, 2024 - 1%) and an inflation rate of 1.50% (December 31, 2024 - 1.50%). The expected undiscounted future obligations allowing for inflation are GBP 330,000 and based on management's best estimate the decommissioning is expected to occur over the next 5 to 10 years. On September 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of the liability is $nil (December 31, 2024 - $666,128). Changes in the provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 are as follows:\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nDecommissioning liability, beginning of period\n$\n666,128\n$\n611,452\nAccretion\n8,706\n11,056\nForeign exchange\n24,944\n43,620\nDisposal of interest in subsidiaries (note 6)\n(699,778\n)\n-\nDecommissioning liability, end of period\n$\n-\n$\n666,128\nAs required by the Crown in Northern Ireland, the Company is required to provide a bond for reclamation related to the Omagh mine in the amount of GBP nil (December 31, 2024 - GBP 300,000), of which GBP nil was funded as of September 30, 2025 (GBP 300,000 was funded as of December 31, 2024) and reported as long-term deposit of $nil (December 31, 2024 - $540,870).\n10.\nAccounts Payable and Other Liabilities\nAccounts payable and other liabilities of the Company are principally comprised of amounts outstanding for purchases relating to exploration costs on exploration and evaluation assets, general operating activities and professional fees activities.\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nAccounts payable\n$\n301,091\n$\n2,015,836\nAccrued liabilities\n459,170\n1,421,166\nTotal accounts payable and other liabilities\n$\n760,261\n$\n3,437,002\nThe following is an aged analysis of the accounts payable and other liabilities:\nAs at\nAs at\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2025\n2024\nLess than 3 months\n$\n227,576\n$\n496,691\n3 to 12 months\n12,293\n555,504\n12 to 24 months\n520,392\n1,304,549\nMore than 24 months\n-\n1,080,258\nTotal accounts payable and other liabilities\n$\n760,261\n$\n3,437,002\n11.\nConvertible Debentures\n(i) On December 20, 2023, the Company closed a $3,502,054 (US$ 2,627,000) convertible debenture. The convertible debenture is unsecured, is for a term of three year commencing on the date that it is issued, carries a coupon of 10% per annum and is convertible into common shares of the Company. Each debenture consists of US$1,000 principal amount of unsecured convertible debentures. The convertible debentures have a term of 36 months from the date of issuance with a conversion price of US$0.255 being the equivalent of a conversion price of $0.35 per conversion share. A four month hold period will apply to common shares converted through the convertible debenture.

On December 20, 2026, any outstanding principal amount of convertible debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be repaid by the Company in cash.\nInterest on the principal amount outstanding under each convertible debenture shall accrue during the period commencing on December 20, 2023 until December 20, 2026 and shall be payable in cash on an annual basis on December 31st of each year (each, an \"Interest Payment Date\"); provided, however, that the first interest payment date shall be December 31, 2024. Each convertible debenture shall bear interest at a minimum interest rate of 10% per annum (the \"Base Interest Rate\"). During each interest period (an \"Interest Period\"), being the period commencing on December 20, 2023 to but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and thereafter the period from and including an Interest Payment Date to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date or other applicable payment date, the Base Interest Rate will be adjusted based on a gold price of US$2,000 per ounce, with the Base Interest Rate being increased by 1% per annum for each US$100 in which the average gold price for such Interest Period exceeds US$2,000 per ounce, up to a maximum interest rate of 30% per annum; provided, however, that, without the prior acceptance of the TSXV, the average interest rate shall not exceed 24% per annum during the term of the convertible debentures. Any adjustment to the Base Interest Rate in respect of an Interest Period shall be calculated based on the average gold price quoted by the London Bullion Market Association, being the LBMA Gold Price PM, in respect of the Interest Period ending on December 31, 2024, from December 20, 2023 to and including December 15, 2024, and for each subsequent Interest Period, from January 1st to and including December 15th of that year or 15 days prior to the applicable payment date.\nMelquart Limited (\"Melquart\"), an insider and control person of the Company (as defined by the TSXV), subscribed for US$875,000.

(\"RDL\") in exchange for common shares (\"Galantas Shares\") of Galantas (the \"RDL Transaction\"). The RDL Transaction will create a combined company that intends to lead the advancement of the Indiana gold-copper project located in Chile (the \"Indiana Project\"), over which RDL holds an option to acquire a 100% interest from Miner\u00eda Activa SpA (\"Activa\") by meeting certain conditions (the \"Option\").\nThe Indiana Project sits within the rich copper-gold-silver belt of the coastal cordillera of the Atacama Region, Chile. The Indiana Project is an operating gold and copper mine, which is ready for immediate expansion. It comprises mineral concessions covering 923 hectares. It is currently 100% owned by Activa, subject to the Option.\nRDL Transaction terms\nAs consideration for the acquisition of RDL, each RDL shareholder (being Lawrence Roulston, Robert Sedgemore and Dorian L. (Dusty) Nicol (the \"RDL Shareholders\")) will receive approximately 44 million Galantas Shares (the \"RDL Shares\"), for an aggregate of approximately 132 million Galantas Shares, which represents 49.99% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares following the issue of the RDL Shares. Additionally, each RDL Shareholder will be granted a 0.66% net smelter returns (\"NSR\") royalty payable by Galantas in respect of the Indiana Project, for an aggregate NSR royalty of approximately 2%.\nThe completion of the RDL Transaction is subject to a number of terms and conditions contained in the Share Purchase Agreement, including without limitation, the approval of the TSXV, there not having occurred a material adverse change in the business of Galantas or RDL, and other standard conditions of closing for a transaction of this nature. There can be no assurance that all necessary approvals will be obtained or that all conditions of closing will be satisfied.\nFollowing the completion of the RDL Transaction and the Concurrent Financing (as defined below), each RDL Shareholder is expected to hold approximately 12.5% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares.\nActiva Option\nIn order to exercise the Option, RDL must make payments totaling US$15 million ($20.9 million) to Activa over a period of five years (the \"Option Period\"), with the first payment of US$500,000 ($696,050) paid by Ocean Partners as an advance to Galantas and paid to Activa in the fourth quarter of 2025 (the \"Ocean Payment\"). The Ocean Payment will be repaid by Galantas from the proceeds of the proposed fundraising as set out below. The remaining payments consist of US$1 million ($1.4 million) in years one and two, US$2 million ($2.8 million) in years three and four and a final payment of US$8.5 million ($11.8 million) in year five (together, the \"Option Payments\").\nRDL has committed to spend a minimum of US$1 million ($1.4 million) per year during the Option Period on exploration and development activities within the Indiana Project. In addition, RDL has committed to (i) excavate a minimum of five hundred linear metres of exploration drifts, (ii) complete a minimum of 2,500 metres of exploration drilling, or (iii) a combination thereof using an equivalence ratio of one metre of drifts for every five metres of drilling.\nUntil RDL has exercised the Option, RDL will be leasing the Indiana Project for a 10% NSR royalty payable to Activa. Until the Indiana Project goes into commercial production, the NSR royalty will be paid as a rent payment, which will not be less than 25% of the Option Payment corresponding to that year. Once the Indiana Project goes into commercial production, the NSR royalty will not be greater than 50% of the Option Payment corresponding to that year.\nThere is an existing NSR royalty of 2.5% payable to an underlying property owner, which covers approximately 40% of the present concessions comprising the Indiana Project and which will be payable by RDL, including after exercise of the Option.\nDetails on RDL\nRDL was incorporated in British Columbia on July 18, 2025, for the purpose of identifying, exploring and developing mining projects. RDL has entered into an agreement with 1555070 B.C. Ltd. (\"155\") in respect of a copper stream at the Indiana Project for a total upfront payment of $550,000 in return for a fixed percentage of copper produced at the Indiana Project to be delivered at a discount to the prevailing copper price (the \"Copper Stream\"). This $550,000 payment has been made to RDL. In return, RDL will deliver to 155 6% of the payable copper delivered from the Indiana Project, until 2,000,000 pounds of copper have been delivered, after which RDL will deliver to 155 3% of the payable copper produced at the Indiana Project, for which 155 will pay 20% of the spot price on delivery. Other than in relation to the Indiana Project, RDL has not entered into any other material agreements.\nBoard of Directors and Management\nPromptly following the closing of the RDL Transaction and subject to regulatory approval(s), Galantas will appoint Lawrence Roulston to its board of directors (the \"Galantas Board\") as a non-executive director and Robert Sedgemore as its Senior Vice President, Operations. Mr. Roulston will receive $30,000 per annum in director fees. Each of Mr. Roulston and Mr. Sedgemore are current shareholders and directors of RDL. No other changes are expected to be made to the Galantas Board or its senior management in connection with the RDL Transaction.\nDorian L. Nicol will act as a special advisor to the Company regarding exploration, on terms to be agreed between the parties in advance of closing of the RDL Transaction.\nConcurrent Financing\nConcurrent with the RDL Transaction, Galantas intends to raise up to $7 million pursuant to a brokered private placement of up to 87,500,000 units of Galantas, at a price of $0.08 per Unit (the \"Concurrent Financing\").\nEach unit will be comprised of one Galantas Share and one Galantas Share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Galantas Share for $0.12 for a period of 36 months from the closing date of the Concurrent Financing.\nThe Company has granted the agents an over-allotment option (the \"Agents' Option\"), which will permit the agents to raise up to an additional $1.05 million through sales of additional units. As compensation for their services, the Company will pay to the agents a cash commission equal to 7.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds of the Concurrent Financing and the Company will issue to the agents compensation warrants in an amount equal to 7.0% of the units sold in the Concurrent Financing. Each compensation warrant will entitle the holder thereof to acquire one Galantas Share for $0.08 for a period of 24 months from the closing date of the Concurrent Financing. The Galantas Shares, Warrants and compensation warrants issuable from the Concurrent Financing will be subject to a statutory hold period expiring four months and one day from the closing of the Concurrent Financing.\nCompletion of the Concurrent Financing is expected to occur on or around December 4, 2025, and is subject to obtaining the required approvals of the TSXV and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nRDL Transaction Timeline\nPursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement and subject to satisfying all necessary conditions and receipt of all required approvals, the parties anticipate completion of the RDL Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nApproval of Board of Directors and Shareholder Support\nAfter consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the Galantas Board of Directors unanimously approved the entering into of the Share Purchase Agreement.\nFollowing consultation with certain shareholders, the Company has received confirmation from its shareholders who hold approximately 57% of the issued and outstanding Galantas Shares, confirming that they are fully supportive of each of the components of the RDL Transaction and that they would vote in favour of the RDL Transaction were a vote on the matter put to the shareholders of the Company at a general meeting. The Company confirms that there are currently no plans to hold a general meeting in order to approve the RDL Transaction.\n(ii)\u00a0On November 21, 2025, the Company announced the increase of the Concurrent Financing to raise up to $13.5 million, consisting of 168,750,000 units at a price of $0.08 per unit. The size of the over-allotment option granted to the agents will be upsized to permit the agents to raise up to an additional $2,025,000 through sales of up to 25,312,500 additional units.\nCompletion of the Concurrent Financing is expected to occur on or around December 10, 2025, and is subject to obtaining the required approvals of the TSXV and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
