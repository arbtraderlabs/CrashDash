The Glenskinnan Renewable Energy Park is a major integrated renewables scheme being developed in partnership with Galileo Empower, a leading European renewable energy developer\n\u00b7\nGlenskinnan is being designed to deliver up to 98 MW of wind generated electrical capacity across 14 turbines, alongside 20 MW of solar PV and 30 MW of battery storage.\u00a0Parkmead's\u00a0owned land at Pitreadie is expected to accommodate over 50% of the combined installed capacity proposed in the planning application, making it a central component of the development\n\u00b7\nKempstone\nHill wind farm delivered consistent performance and revenue during the period\n\u00b7\nProduction of electricity increased by 6% to 2,717 MWh (2024: 2,570 MWh)\n\u00b7\nParkmead\u00a0has achieved and maintained an exceptionally high level of operational efficiency at Kempstone Hill, in the range 96-99%\nNetherlands Gas Asset Base Expanding\n\u00b7\nParkmead\u00a0has retained 100% of its cash producing assets, including all its interests in the Netherlands gas fields\n\u00b7\nThese assets continue to provide valuable cash flow and growth potential, which both support the Group's future strategy.\n\u00b7\nFurther drilling is being planned for 2026 at Drenthe V\n\u00b7\nDetailed design work is also underway for an additional well on the Drenthe VI licence\nParkmead is Well Positioned for Future Growth\n\u00b7\nNon-hydrocarbon share of total revenues increased for the third consecutive year to 15% of revenue (2024: 12%)\n\u00b7\nCost of sales reduced to \u00a32.2 million (2024: \u00a3 2.3 million) through strict cost discipline\n\u00b7\nGiven that\u00a0Parkmead\u00a0is no longer an offshore licence operator in the\u00a0North Sea, with all the regulatory aspects and operational demands that entails, we have reduced staff levels and reduced our office space by over 40%\n\u00b7\nParkmead's balance sheet remains strong with total assets of \u00a332.5 million\nParkmead's Executive Chairman, Tom Cross, commented:\n\"Parkmead has delivered a year of exceptional results, through strong operational performance and by securing a strategic divestment of our offshore North Sea oil licences. Together these have strengthened our finances significantly and achieved earnings of over 6.7 pence per share.\nOur Net Assets have built to \u00a327 million, which is equivalent to 25 pence per share.\nParkmead continues to benefit from a balanced approach to building its portfolio and is increasing its exposure to the UK renewables market. The Glenskinnan Renewable Energy Park is aligned to the new UK Government targets for onshore wind.\nThe Group's robust financial position provides Parkmead with a distinct advantage as we seek to further enhance shareholder value through growth opportunities across the Group.\"\nFor enquiries please contact:\nThe Parkmead Group plc\n+44 (0) 1224 622200\nTom Cross (Executive Chairman)\nAndrew Smith (Business Development Director)\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nMarc Milmo / Seamus Fricker - Corporate Finance\nAndrew Burdis - ECM\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nI am pleased to report on a transformational year for Parkmead in 2025.\nBuilding upon our experience and detailed understanding of the challenges and uncertainty facing the future of the UK offshore oil & gas industry, the Board's strategy of diversifying our asset base has proven its worth. Our UK onshore renewables portfolio has provided a platform for the Group to drive forward, despite the political headwinds faced by the upstream E&P sector. Renewable energy is growing to become a more substantial part of our overall revenue, totalling 15% in FY25 compared with 12% in the prior year. This growth in green energy complements our low carbon, natural gas production in the Netherlands.\nThrough focused management, the Group has delivered a 39% increase in earnings per share of 6.72p and profit after tax of \u00a37.35 million. The key component of this was the successful sale of Parkmead's wholly owned subsidiary Parkmead (E&P) Limited. Through this innovative deal we will receive \u00a314 million of firm cash consideration and also retain significant upside relating to each of the two offshore exploration licences we sold. Up to a further \u00a3120 million may become payable to Parkmead, should field development plans be approved in the future.\nOur strong financial position and broad asset base positions Parkmead extremely well, with no material capital commitments. Our natural gas fields in the Netherlands provide ongoing production and opportunities for organic growth via further drilling for additional reserves.\nParkmead is now very well placed to exploit new growth opportunities during the next phase of the Company's development, as we look to build value from renewable energies and natural gas.\nStrong Financial Performance\nParkmead has delivered a record profit after tax of \u00a37.35m (FY24: \u00a34.94m) due to the large gain realised from the disposal of Parkmead (E&P) Limited, coupled with strong operating performance. This is equivalent to earnings per share of 6.72p (FY24: 4.52p).\nGroup turnover for the year was \u00a34.1m (FY24: \u00a35.7m). The year-on-year decrease was due to a reduction in gas volumes as a result of some maintenance shut downs and natural decline. The average realised gas price in the period increased to \u20ac40.1/MWh (FY24: \u20ac34.2/MWh). Electricity generation at Kempstone Hill increased to 2,717MWh (FY24: 2,570 MWh).\nOperating costs have remained very tightly controlled at \u00a32.2m (FY24: \u00a32.3m) contributing to a strong operating profit for the period of \u00a37.5m (FY24: \u00a31.3m).\nParkmead continued to build a strong balance sheet with net assets increasing by 38% to \u00a327.0m equivalent to 25 pence per share (FY24: \u00a319.6m). Cash and cash equivalents in the year rose 39% to \u00a313.2m (FY24: \u00a39.5m).\nOur modest financial debt has continued to reduce with \u00a30.7m outstanding at 30th June 2025 (FY24: \u00a30.8m). This small debt was inherited as a result of the acquisition of Kempstone Hill Wind Energy Limited.\nStrategic Divestment of Parkmead (E&P) Limited\nParkmead carefully considered the outlook for its UK North Sea oil licences and the major capital requirements that would be needed were they to be progressed through drilling, appraisal and development. The offshore sector has serious difficulties in the form of high and rising costs and the current negative political environment towards UK oil & gas, with the focus of the UK Government on its net-zero strategy. In this context, Parkmead believes that the opportunity to progress these offshore UK licences is best served within the portfolio of a larger, North Sea focused company.\nParkmead remains exposed to the large upside on both the Skerryvore and Fynn licences, but without any capital requirements, through contingent payments of up to \u00a330m and \u00a390m respectively, should Skerryvore or Fynn reach field development plan (FDP) approval.\nPost completion, the Skerryvore joint venture received an 18 month extension on the licence to 31 March 2027 to allow time for the drilling of the commitment well.\nNetherlands Gas Assets Expanding\nParkmead's portfolio of onshore natural gas fields in the Netherlands has continued to perform in line with expectation. Gross production across the portfolio was 2.1kboepd (thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day).\nThe outlook for the Drenthe VI concession is particularly exciting, with numerous attractive prospects being analysed. Parkmead has also agreed the unitisation of the neighbouring VDW-A prospect, which sits partially on its Drenthe VI concession, ahead of a potential Final Investment Decision being taken by the partnership.\nAt the Company's important Papekop field development, work is ongoing with detailed surface, well and pipeline work scheduled for 2026.\nAt Drenthe V plans are continuing to prepare well design and long lead requirements for a GSB-02 well in 2026. This includes targeting new gas reserves which are now understood to be separated from, and therefore additional to, the rest of the field. Recent technical work has calculated that significant in-place gas volumes of 157Bcf remain at Geesbrug and Geesbrug-02.\nUK Renewable Energy Portfolio is Growing\nKempstone Hill Wind Farm\nOur operated wind farm at Kempstone Hill has continued to perform well during the year, generating 2,717MWh (FY24: 2,570MWh) of electricity. Excellent uptime has been achieved, allowing for more power to be generated in the period, with average uptime of 98% during the year (FY24: 90%). Shut downs for routine maintenance in the prior period reduced uptime.\nFollowing the year end, the Group successfully negotiated an updated Purchase Price Agreement covering Kempstone for the twelve month period ending 30 September 2026 at an average export price of \u00a387.6/MWh.\nPitreadie Wind and Solar Projects\nParkmead is in advanced commercial discussions with a major renewable energy developer, Galileo Empower, regarding a potential joint venture whereby Parkmead would participate in a significant renewable energy development of up to 98 MW of generation via 14 wind turbines, 20MW of solar photovoltaics (PV) and 30MW of battery energy storage system (BESS). Together these three projects at Pitreadie form the Glenskinnan Renewable Energy Park.\nInitial public consultation was completed in 2025 and over the coming months further consultations are scheduled before a Section 36 planning application is lodged.\nParkmead's\u00a0owned land at Pitreadie is expected to accommodate over 50% of the combined installed capacity proposed in the planning application, making it a central component of the development.\nBrachmont Solar Opportunity\nParkmead's renewable energy team is examining a number of further solar power opportunities. Studies include the technical merits and commercial potential to develop a solar energy farm in the Brachmont area of Aberdeenshire, where conditions appear favourable.\nOutlook\nWe are in a position of relative financial strength due to our Netherlands gas and UK renewable income streams, our healthy cash balances and carefully controlled costs. In addition, the Group has exposure to significant upside potential from future contingent payments of up to \u00a3120m should FDP approvals occur on the Skerryvore and Fynn Beauly UK offshore licences.\nAs set out above, we believe that there is an opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value from the groundwork we have done to date. Parkmead continues to progress its attractive hopper of organic growth initiatives, such as the Glenskinnan Renewable Energy Park development opportunity, whilst expanding our portfolio of natural gas targets in the Netherlands. We are also focused on complementing our organic growth by exploring opportunities to build upon the Group's asset base through carefully selected acquisitions.\nOil and gas will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix and we are continuing to assess international E&P investment in lower cost environments than the UK North Sea.\nBeyond these opportunities, we are also targeting the acquisition of further cashflow generating renewable energy assets onshore UK to deliver additional value for our shareholders.\nTom Cross\nExecutive Chairman\n24 November 2025\nGroup statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income\nfor the year ended 30 June 2025\n30/06/2025\n30/06/2024\nContinuous operations\nNotes\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n4,053\n5,720\nCost of sales\n(2,187)\n(2,302)\nGross profit\n1,866\n3,418\nExploration and evaluation expenses\n(1,477)\n(300)\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment\n(1,185)\n-\nGain / (loss) on sale of assets\n11,818\n(2)\nAdministrative (expenses)/credit\n(3,482)\n(1,780)\nOperating profit / (loss)\n7,540\n1,336\nFinance income\n187\n148\nFinance costs\n(254)\n(412)\nProfit / (loss) before taxation\n7,473\n1,072\nTaxation\n(127)\n2,357\nWindfall taxation\n-\n1,513\nProfit / (loss) for the period attributable to the equity holders of the Parent\n7,346\n4,942\nProfit / (loss) per share (pence)\nBasic\n6.72\n4.52\nDiluted\n6.72\n4.07\nGroup statement of financial position\nas at 30 June 2025\n30/06/2025\n30/06/2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nNon-current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment: development & production\n2,188\n4,049\nProperty, plant and equipment: other\n5,577\n5,603\nGoodwill\n1,084\n1,084\nExploration and evaluation assets\n40\n2,481\nTrade and other receivables\n3,622\n-\nTotal non-current assets\n12,511\n13,217\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n3,567\n1,632\nInterest bearing loans\n2,703\n2,936\nCash and cash equivalents\n13,245\n9,486\nTerm deposits\n438\n-\nTotal current assets\n19,953\n14,054\nTotal assets\n32,464\n27,271\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n(2,854)\n(1,877)\nWindfall taxation\n-\n(861)\nCurrent tax liabilities\n(91)\n(2,192)\nTotal current liabilities\n(2,945)\n(4,930)\nNon-current liabilities\nOther liabilities\n(1,220)\n(760)\nLoan\n-\n(668)\nDecommissioning provisions\n(1,309)\n(1,269)\nTotal non-current liabilities\n(2,529)\n(2,697)\nTotal liabilities\n(5,474)\n(7,627)\nNet assets\n26,990\n19,644\nEquity attributable to equity holders\nCalled up share capital\n19,688\n19,688\nShare premium\n83,625\n83,625\nMerger reserve\n3,376\n3,376\nRetained deficit\n(79,699)\n(87,045)\nTotal equity\n26,990\n19,644\nGroup statement of changes in equity\nfor the year ended 30 June 2025\nShare capital\nShare premium\nMerger reserve\nRetained deficit\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAt 30 June 2023\n19,688\n83,625\n3,376\n(92,029)\n14,660\nProfit for the period\n-\n-\n-\n4,942\n4,942\nTotal comprehensive profit for the year\n-\n-\n-\n4,942\n4,942\nShare-based payments\n-\n-\n-\n42\n42\nAt 30 June 2024\n19,688\n83,625\n3,376\n(87,045)\n19,644\nProfit for the period\n-\n-\n-\n7,346\n7346\nTotal comprehensive profit for the year\n-\n-\n-\n7,346\n7346\nAt 30 June 2025\n19,688\n83,625\n3,376\n(79,699)\n26,990\nGroup statement of cashflows\nfor the year ended 30 June 2025\n2025\n2024\nNotes\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCashflows from operating activities\nCashflows from operations\n(306)\n1,516\nTaxation received / (paid)\n(2,231)\n753\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n(2,537)\n2,269\nCash flow from investing activities\nInterest received\n144\n109\nAcquisition of exploration and evaluation assets\n(208)\n(414)\nAcquisition of property, plant and equipment: development and production\n(148)\n(187)\nDisposal of assets\n7,322\n-\nAcquisition of property, plant and equipment: other\n-\n(549)\nDecommissioning expenditure\n(32)\n(2,809)\nInterest bearing loans\n230\n-\nChange in term deposits\n(438)\n-\nNet cash used in investing activities\n6,870\n(3,850)\nCash flow from financing activities\nLease payments\n(369)\n(239)\nInterest paid\n(88)\n(180)\nRepayment of loans and borrowings\n(99)\n(99)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(556)\n(518)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n3,777\n(2,099)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n9,486\n11,576\nEffect of foreign exchange rate differences\n(18)\n9\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n13,245\n9,486\nNotes to the financial information for the year ended 30 June 2025\n1.\nBasis of preparation of the financial information\nThe financial information set out in this announcement does not comprise the Group and Company's statutory accounts for the years ended 30 June 2025 or 30 June 2024.\nThe financial information has been extracted from the audited statutory accounts for the years ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024. The auditors reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified and did not contain a statement under either Section 498 (2) or Section 498 (3) of the Companies Act 2006 and did not include references to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis.\nThe statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2024 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The\nstatutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies following the\nCompany's Annual General Meeting.\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the interim results for the period ended 31 December 2024 and the statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2024 and have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (\"IFRS\").\n2.\nAdministrative expenses\nAdministrative expenses include a charge in respect of a non-cash revaluation of share appreciation rights (SARs) and share based payments totalling \u00a332,000 (2024: credit \u00a3661,000). The SARs may be settled via shares or cash and are therefore revalued with the movement in share price. The valuation was impacted by the increase in share price between 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2025.\n3.\nProfit / (loss) per share\nProfit/(loss) per share attributable to equity holders of the Company arise from continuing and discontinued operations as follows:\n2025\n2024\nProfit per 1.5p ordinary share from continuing operations (pence)\nBasic\n6.72p\n4.52p\nDiluted\n6.72p\n4.07p\nThe calculations were based on the following information:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfit attributable to ordinary shareholders\nContinuing operations\n7,346\n4,942\nTotal\n7,346\n4,942\nWeighted average number of shares in issue\nBasic weighted average number of shares\n109,266,931\n109,188,561\nDilutive potential ordinary shares\nShare options\n-\n-\nProfit/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.\nDiluted profit/(loss) per share\nProfit/(loss) per share requires presentation of diluted profit/(loss) per share when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease net profit or net loss per share. When the group makes a loss the outstanding share options are therefore anti-dilutive and so are not included in dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n4.\nNotes to the statement of cashflows\nReconciliation of operating profit to net cash flow from continuing operations\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3000\nOperating profit\n7,540\n1,346\nDepreciation\n1,701\n1,027\nAmortisation and exploration write-off\n1,417\n-\nDisposal of assets\n(7,322)\nProfit/(Loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment\n-\n2\nProvision for share based payments\n-\n42\nCurrency translation adjustments\n18\n(9)\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment: development and production\n1,185\n-\nDecreases / (increase) in receivables\n(6,550)\n(691)\nDecrease in stock\n-\n16\nIncrease/(decrease) in payables\n1,705\n(207)\nNet cash flow from operations\n(306)\n1,516\n5.\nApproval of this preliminary announcement\nThis announcement was approved by the Board of Directors on 24 November 2025.\n6.\nPublication of annual report and accounts\nCopies of the Annual Report and Accounts will be made available shortly on the Company's website www.parkmeadgroup.com, along with a copy of this announcement.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

He has extensive experience in senior executive and non-executive positions including roles as Chairman and CEO. He has held senior roles in companies such as Weatherford International, Sparrows Group and RGB Limited, and has wide-ranging UK and international experience operating across numerous countries.\nIn addition to serving Parkmead as an independent non-executive director, Doug will chair the Company's Audit Committee and serve as a member of the Remuneration Committee.\nGiven the continued renewal of expertise and independent advice at\u00a0Parkmead, the Company is well positioned for future growth with a strong and balanced portfolio of assets and an experienced team which is focused on delivery.\nEarlier this year the Parkmead Board completed the successful sale of one of the Group's subsidiaries, which held operated interests in two offshore UK licences. This divestment brings \u00a314 million of firm cash into Parkmead, \u00a37 million of which has been received to date and the remaining \u00a37 million is contracted to be received over the next 15 months. In addition, Parkmead may potentially receive up to a further \u00a3120 million in contingent cash payments in the event of future field development plans being approved.\nThe Company's next annual results, to 30 June 2025, are due to be released before the end of this month.\nTom Cross, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"Doug is a highly respected figure in the energy sector. He brings a wealth of additional experience to the Parkmead Board at this important stage in the Group's development.

This exclusive arrangement with EMAL has already delivered a number of significant and highly valuable project opportunities to Parkmead. This includes the Pitreadie wind farm opportunity which forms a key part of the proposed major Glenskinnan Renewable Energy Park, which is being developed in partnership with Galileo Empower, a leading European renewable energy developer. The plans include 98MW of wind power, 20MW of solar PV and 30MW of battery storage. The acquisition of 100% of the operational Kempstone Hill Wind Farm also arose through this arrangement, with Kempstone Hill having contributed to Parkmead's revenues since February 2022.\nAs previously announced, the Company continues to evaluate M&A opportunities in the renewable sector and a number of these potential opportunities in areas such as wind and solar energies, battery storage, forestry and biomass have emanated through this agreement with EMAL.\nFor the extended period of exclusivity, agreed to 31 December 2028, two key terms of the associated loan have been reset as follows: 1. the loan principal has been reduced to \u00a32.4m following repayments by EMAL to Parkmead of a further \u00a3270,000 in July 2025, 2. the interest rate will increase and will be a floating rate equivalent to the Bank of England base rate (currently at 4.25%). The overall effect of this extension is that Parkmead secures substantial exclusivity rights to new renewable energy projects at zero net cash cost to Parkmead.\nThe entry by the Company into the Exclusivity Agreement extension and associated loan extension with EMAL, in which\u00a0Tom Cross\u00a0is a director and shareholder, is a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. The independent Directors (being those other than\u00a0Tom Cross), having consulted with Cavendish Capital Markets Limited, consider that such arrangements with EMAL are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nEnquiries:\nThe Parkmead Group plc\n+44 (0) 1224 622200\nTom Cross\u00a0(Executive Chairman)\nAndrew Smith (Executive Director - Business Development)\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\u00a0(NOMAD and Broker to\u00a0Parkmead)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nMarc Milmo\u00a0/\u00a0Seamus Fricker\u00a0- Corporate Finance\nIain MacArthur - Sales\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nThe Parkmead Group plc\n(\"Parkmead\", \"the Company\" or \"the Group\")\nOperational Update\nParkmead is pleased to report on the successful conclusion of all post-completion tasks in the sale of its UK offshore petroleum licences to Serica Energy plc, via the previously announced sale of its subsidiary Parkmead E&P Ltd, worth up to a potential \u00a3134 million to the Group.\nThe Company has retained 100% of its cash producing assets, namely its four producing onshore gas fields in the Netherlands and its onshore electricity producing wind farm in Scotland.\nParkmead now intends to focus its attention on the delivery of greener energy. Therefore the disposal of Parkmead E&P Ltd marks a significant step in recalibrating the Company's portfolio, rendering Parkmead well poised to capitalise on opportunities in renewables, with a view to driving future growth and generating value for shareholders.\nIncreased Financial Strength\nParkmead is in a strong financial position, with cash balances of approximately \u00a313 million as at 30 June 2025. The Group has minimal outstanding debt of just \u00a30.7 million, which remains from the development of our 100% owned and operated wind farm at Kempstone Hill.\nIn addition, Parkmead will be receiving additional deferred cash totalling \u00a37.0 million, relating to the sale of its UK E&P subsidiary to Serica. This further cash comprises two payments of \u00a33.1 million and \u00a33.9 million, due on 27 February 2026 and 27 February 2027 respectively. These payments are firm and unconditional. There are further potential payments to Parkmead of up to \u00a330 million and \u00a390 million, conditional on future field development approvals on the Skerryvore and Fynn licences respectively, providing the Company and its shareholders with the potential opportunity to realise significant additional upside in the future.\nGlenskinnan Renewable Energy Park\nParkmead continues to advance its stake in the Glenskinnan Renewable Energy Park, a major integrated renewables project being developed in partnership with Galileo Empower, a leading European renewable energy developer.\nThe integrated scheme is being designed to deliver up to 98 MW of wind generated electrical capacity across 14 turbines, alongside 20 MW of solar PV and 30 MW of battery storage. Parkmead's owned land at Pitreadie will accommodate over 50% of the combined installed capacity proposed in the planning application, making it a central component of the development.\nKey milestones include:\n- Initial public consultation, completed in April 2025\n- Scheme design being finalised in 2H 2025\n- Second public consultation scheduled for end of Q3 2025\n- Section 36 planning application to be submitted to Scottish Government during Q4 2025\nParkmead and Galileo are currently finalising commercial arrangements ahead of the Section 36 application, with the project representing a significant step forward in the Group's renewable energy strategy.\nNetherlands Natural Gas Fields\nIn the first half of 2025, Parkmead's Dutch fields delivered an average net production of 155 boe/d. A successful coiled-tubing water wash was completed at Geesbrug in March, resulting in production doubling on this asset. An unplanned shutdown of the Vries system impacted performance at Grolloo, with production now successfully reinstated.\nA number of new drilling targets are being evaluated to boost future production. Our Dutch business benefited from stronger commodity market conditions. During the first half of 2025, realised gas sales pricing increased to \u20ac41.86/MWh from \u20ac38.16/MWh in the prior six months. These assets continue to provide reliable cash flow and growth potential which supports the Group's broader strategy.\nKempstone Hill Wind Farm\nThe Parkmead operated wind farm at Kempstone Hill continued to perform strongly through the first half of 2025. Over the last 12 months Parkmead has achieved and maintained an exceptionally high level of operational efficiency, in the range 96-99%. This demonstrates the reliability of the asset. The Group is continuing to assess the potential to expand the electricity production capability of the Kempstone Hill site, to make use of its excess grid capacity.\nCorporate and Business Development\nParkmead is continuing to mature a range of high-impact investment and acquisition opportunities. These initiatives are aligned with the Group's strategy to grow and diversify its interests across international E&P and UK renewable energy projects.\nGiven that Parkmead will no longer be an offshore licence Operator in the North Sea, with all the regulatory aspects and operational demands that entails, we have reduced staff positions and reduced our office space by over 40%. After more than four years of excellent service as a non-executive director, Robert Finlay has left the board with immediate effect to focus on his other activities. We would like to thank Robert for his important contribution to the Group and wish him every success in the future. The Company is well advanced in its process to bring a further independent NED onboard and will provide an update in due course.\nParkmead's Executive Chairman, Tom Cross, commented:\n\"Parkmead has made strong progress across all elements of the business in the first half of 2025. We have completed the sale of our UK offshore-focused subsidiary, delivered solid operational performance from our onshore producing assets, advanced our flagship renewable energy project at Glenskinnan, and achieved a very healthy and robust financial position.\nOur continued focus on strategic growth and efficiency ensures Parkmead is well positioned for the future.\"\nThe Parkmead Group plc\n+44 (0) 1224 622200\nTom Cross (Executive Chairman)\nAndrew Smith (Executive Director - Business Development)\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nMarc Milmo / Seamus Fricker - Corporate Finance\nIain MacArthur - Sales\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
