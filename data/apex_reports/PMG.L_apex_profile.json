The acquisition was immediately revenue and cash flow enhancing. In the last 12 months the wind farm generated 2,850 MWh with a 99.7% availability, enough to power up to 1,000 homes. Kempstone Hill benefits from an attractive inflation-linked, Feed-in Tariff through until 2036. The annual PPA was renegotiated for the year commencing 1 August 2022 and this has seen wholesale export electricity prices increase by nearly 250% leading to a significant boost in near term cashflow.\nParkmead has been assessing a number of opportunities to further enhance the Kempstone Hill Wind Farm, such as the potential inclusion of solar power generation, and expanding sales of electricity to local industrial users.\nEnhanced opportunity for hybrid renewable energy development at Pitreadie\nInitial feasibility studies on the Pitreadie project have confirmed the potential for a wind farm development.\nThe major shift in the electricity generation market has changed the dynamics of renewable projects and Parkmead has decided to progress Pitreadie based on a hybrid of renewable technologies, rather than one just focused on wind. To that effect, Parkmead is progressing the necessary work required to allow the Company to consider submitting a full planning application for a combined wind and solar farm, with added potential for a battery storage unit.\nTom Cross, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"The Kempstone Hill Wind Farm acquisition has been complementary to our earlier stage, high-upside renewable energy projects, which we are now progressing at pace. We are delighted by the contribution made to date by Kempstone Hill to the Group, especially considering the significant upside arising from the increases in wholesale electricity prices seen in the last 12 months.\nThe Parkmead team continues to assess all opportunities to expand our Renewable Energy division, both organically and through acquisition.\"\nEnquiries:\nThe Parkmead Group plc\n+44 (0) 1224 622200\nTom Cross (Executive Chairman)\nRyan Stroulger (Chief Financial Officer)\nfinnCap Ltd (NOMAD and Broker to Parkmead)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nMarc Milmo / Seamus Fricker - Corporate Finance\nAndrew Burdis - ECM\nAbout Parkmead\nThe Parkmead Group is an independent, UK and Netherlands focused energy business. Its shares are listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (AIM: PMG).

As a result, revenue for the year to 30 June 2022 from the Company's Dutch gas assets is now expected to exceed \u20ac14.5 million, ahead of the Board's expectations.\nGas prices have remained around \u20ac100/MWh following the invasion of Ukraine and prices have experienced a large upward spike since mid-June 2022. Parkmead expects gas prices could remain elevated for the short to medium term, due to tight gas supplies in Europe, therefore Parkmead has chosen to remain 100% unhedged.\nThe average netback for the year to 30 June 2022 from the Netherlands was approximately $120 per barrel of oil equivalent (\"boe\"), with a field operating cost of just US$8.6 per boe. Average gross production for the year across these assets was 21.8 million cubic feet per day (\"MMscfd\"), approximately 3,750 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nNew two-well gas drilling campaign is ahead of schedule\nA drilling rig has been secured for the upcoming 'LDS' two-well campaign in the Netherlands. We now expect to receive the rig by early Q4 2022, ahead of the schedule outlined in the interim results. The LDS wells will be drilled from the existing Diever well site and will target a combined mid-case gas-in-place of 37.2 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\") in the prolific Rotliegendes reservoirs within this licence. The production tie-in period for these onshore targets is very short and, provided success at LDS, would result in significant additional revenue and cash flow for Parkmead.\nTom Cross, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"We have delivered record gas revenue from our Dutch gas assets for the year to 30 June 2022 and remain very confident in the outlook for these assets as we build momentum across Parkmead's operations in this region.\nThe innovative royalty deal we completed last summer is now bearing fruit and is adding considerable value to Parkmead. Our Company remains 100% unhedged and is directly benefiting from these additional gas sales at higher prices.\nWe are also delighted that our drilling campaign in the Netherlands is currently ahead of schedule.\nTo complement our Dutch assets, we will continue to focus on building a portfolio of high-quality energy projects through acquisitions, organic growth and the active management of our assets across all energy sectors.\"\nEnquiries:\nThe Parkmead Group plc\n+44 (0) 1224 622200\nTom Cross (Executive Chairman)\nRyan Stroulger (Chief Financial Officer)\nfinnCap Ltd (NOMAD and Broker to Parkmead)\n+44 (0) 20 7220 0500\nMarc Milmo / Seamus Fricker - Corporate Finance\nAndrew Burdis - ECM\nAbout Parkmead\nThe Parkmead Group is an independent, UK and Netherlands focused energy business.

The well has been tied into the neighbouring commercial gas production infrastructure in just a few weeks, demonstrating again the operational efficiency of Parkmead's low-cost assets onshore the Netherlands, where operating costs are less than $9 per barrel equivalent.\nThis new discovery is in its initial clean up period, and early flow rates suggest that Parkmead will benefit from a material increase in daily net production.\nWe look forward to updating shareholders with further information in due course.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation 596/2014.

Parkmead will be operator and hold a 50% working interest, alongside its partner Orcadian Energy (CNS) Limited. The new licence contains seven undeveloped oil discoveries within Mesozoic and Palaeozoic reservoirs. The most substantial of these is Fynn Beauly.\nFynn Beauly is one of the largest undeveloped oil accumulations in the UK, with estimated gross P50 contingent resources of 292 million barrels. This large heavy oil discovery is situated between the prolific Claymore and Piper fields. The field extends across all three awarded blocks and is estimated to contain oil-in-place of between 740 and 1,330 million barrels. This is an important award because the acreage which encapsulates this significant oil field has not previously been licensed to a single partner group, creating an exciting opportunity for Parkmead and Orcadian to advance the development of this substantial, previously untapped resource.\nThe current licence commitment requires no major capital outlay. The work programme is focused on assessing the feasibility of reducing Fynn Beauly oil viscosity using enhanced oil recovery techniques. This work will include assessing the potential to utilise geothermal energy as part of the recovery mechanism to avoid the need for injected hot water. This would allow for the delivery of a successful development of this major field which is in line with the NSTA's Net Zero Strategy.\nTom Cross, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"This award demonstrates further success in Parkmead's strategy to identify value enhancing opportunities through lower risk developments, which are aligned with the NSTA's Net Zero strategy. It also reaffirms Parkmead's status as a responsible and capable operator on the UKCS.\"\nEnquiries:\nThe Parkmead Group plc\n+44 (0) 1224 622200\nTom Cross (Executive Chairman)\nAndrew Smith (Executive Director - Business Development)\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd (NOMAD and Broker to Parkmead)\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nMarc Milmo / Seamus Fricker- Corporate Finance\nLeif Powis - Sales\nThe Group's Nominated Adviser and Broker, finnCap Ltd, has now changed its name to Cavendish\nCapital Markets Ltd following completion of its own corporate merger.\nAbout Parkmead\nThe Parkmead Group is a UK and Netherlands focused independent energy group listed on AIM of the\nLondon Stock Exchange (AIM: PMG).
