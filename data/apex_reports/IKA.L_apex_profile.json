According to analysis by automotive experts\u00a0Balance Batteries, this technology\u00a0could\u00a0reduce battery pack weight by 20% and\u00a0cut manufacturing costs\u00a0by \u00a32,500\u00a0per vehicle.\nThe prototypes were manufactured on Ilika's automated pilot line, completed in October 2025. The automation has already shown significant benefits, with the first batch\u00a0achieving\u00a0a 93% manufacturing\u00a0success rate (yield), which is well above the\u00a0minimum\u00a0required for\u00a0moving to\u00a0full production.\nThe Company has also created initial samples of larger 50Ah P2 cells for testing, which will be available for shipping after feedback has been received on the current 10Ah cells which is expected during 2026.\nGraeme Purdy, CEO of Ilika, said:\n\"\nWe are excited that that our new automated pilot line is now producing high-quality, consistent battery prototypes for our partners to evaluate. This achievement is a significant milestone toward bringing our technology to market, further opening the window for licensing discussions with manufacturers.\"\nHead of Battery Development at a major UK automotive supplier serving global car manufacturers said:\n\"\nHere in the UK and more broadly in Europe, there is significant interest in developing technical solutions that are differentiated from the offerings available from established cell manufacturers. We look forward to evaluating these 10Ah prototypes from Ilika, which demonstrate the Company's sustained capability to improve and mature their product for commercial roll-out.\"\nThe information communicated within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018.

This achievement followed successful equipment commissioning in January 2025 and represented the final technical validation before commencement of production. The qualified manufacturing line includes sophisticated layer deposition, alignment, and patterning systems essential for producing medical-grade micro-batteries. The milestone progressed a ten-year manufacturing agreement signed in August 2023, under which Cirtec Medical will produce Ilika's Stereax battery portfolio. This collaboration combines Ilika's advanced battery technology with Cirtec Medical's established medical device manufacturing expertise to address growing demand for miniaturised medical implants. Barring any last-minute delays due to international logistics over the US-UK festive period, initial deliveries of Stereax M300 batteries to lead customers are targeted to commence in Q4 2025.\nGoliath\nGoliath batteries are large format SSBs designed for\nelectric vehicles\nand consumer appliances.\nAt the beginning of the Period, Ilika confirmed that its Goliath 2Ah P1 cells had been validated by customer testing at its OEM and Tier 1 testing partners. In July 2025, the Company announced the award of further grant support to manufacture the first Goliath A-Sample batteries for automotive applications. This support is being provided from the newly launched Demonstrate fund, facilitated by the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK, in a 12-month, \u00a33 million collaboration programme, of which Ilika is receiving \u00a31.25 million in grant funding. By September 2025, Ilika was able to confirm Jaguar Land Rover and Professor Paul Shearing of Oxford University had joined the programme in strategic steering roles.\nLast month, the Company announced it had completed commissioning of its automated assembly line, marking full operational status for its Goliath SSB pilot production facility. The automated line significantly improves manufacturing yield and product consistency, enabling Ilika to deliver the larger volumes of Goliath SSBs required for both internal validation and customer testing programmes. Following this important milestone, Ilika remains on track to begin releasing 10Ah prototypes to customers in December 2025, with 50Ah cells following based on 10Ah feedback and customer demand.\nFinancial Update:\nThe Company expects to announce revenue for the Period of \u00a30.6m (H1 2024/5:\u00a0\u00a31.0m), resulting from the DRIVE35 PRIMED grant funded programme which commenced in August and accelerates through the second half of the financial year. EBITDA loss, excluding share-based payments, is expected to be\u00a0\u00a33.2m\u00a0(H1 2024/5:\u00a0loss of\u00a0\u00a31.9m) for the Period, reflecting a ramp up of costs associated with developing, manufacturing and testing the Goliath 10Ah prototypes. Cash and cash equivalents at the Period end\u00a0were\u00a0\u00a36.9m\u00a0(H1 2024/5:\u00a0\u00a310.1m).\nAnalyst Briefing\nThe management team will be hosting a hybrid analyst briefing at 9.30 a.m. on 22 January 2026.

The automated line significantly improves manufacturing yield and product consistency, enabling Ilika to deliver the larger volumes of Goliath SSBs required for both internal validation and customer testing programmes.\nFurther to the outlook statement in our\nFY 2025 full year results\npublished in July 2025, Ilika's SSB pilot line is now fully operational and provides the capability and increased capacity to deliver 10Ah P1.5 prototypes (first generation 10 amp-hour batteries) and initial sampling quantities of its 50Ah P2 prototypes (second generation 50 amp-hour batteries) to customers to support their internal test programmes. Commercial test programmes require large numbers of identical cells to ensure robustness of data and these needs can now be met by Ilika utilising its own facility.\nTo further scale up 50Ah battery production to A-Sample volumes (pre-production quantities for automotive testing), as described in its\nannouncement\nin September 2025, the Company will continue its collaboration with UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC), in the PRIMED programme, supported by the Advanced Propulsion Centre with Jaguar Land Rover and HSSMI. B-Samples (pre-production samples manufactured on industrial-scale production equipment) will be produced in collaboration with licensees.\nFollowing this important milestone, Ilika remains on track to begin releasing its 10Ah P1.5 prototypes to customers in December 2025, with 50Ah cells following based on P1.5 feedback and customer demand.\nGraeme Purdy, CEO of Ilika, said:\n\"\nThe completion of the Goliath pilot line is a major milestone in our journey to commercialisation. This automation delivers the consistent performance and quality our customers require for their validation programmes, while de-risking their future scale-up to giga-scale production. This is a strong and clear step towards achieving our licencing objectives.\"\nSean Gilgun, CEO of UKBIC said:\n\"Ilika will be one of the first companies to use our new flexible pilot line, which is great news. It's hugely positive to see that their ambitious plans continue apace. This latest announcement is confirmation that Ilika has successfully completed the bridge between its own capability, our FPL and full-scale capability, to produce automotive A- and B-Samples. We look forward to further collaboration between Ilika and UKBIC in the PRIMED project.\"\nThe information communicated within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018.
