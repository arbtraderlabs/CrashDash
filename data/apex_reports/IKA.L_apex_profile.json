Having completed the process qualification of our equipment at Cirtec Medical's facility in the USA, we were able to commence production of the initial batches of Stereax prototype product that we released to customers at the end of 2025. This marks a significant step towards full commercial production.\n\"The period started with confirmation that a customer had validated our 2Ah Goliath battery prototypes and judged them to be in the leading cohort of SSBs. We built on that foundation through collaboration with the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre, demonstrating that our process has a clear route to gigafactory manufacturing. Upon completion of our automated pilot line in October, we were able to produce and ship our first 10Ah Goliath prototypes. Grant funding from the UK Government's DRIVE35 programme managed by the Advanced Propulsion Centre has been important in supporting our progress this year. While further funding is expected from grant applications which we have in flight, this is not likely to be contiguous with our current funding, due to the timing of application and award processes. The current DRIVE35 grant is expected to have been fully deployed in Q1CY26 and we are confident of further support for our roadmap. All in all, we are pleased with progress to date but there is a lot more to do and to come in the second half.\"\nOperational Highlights\nStereax (Medical Device Applications)\n\u00b7\nCompleted the manufacturing process qualification\nfor Stereax batteries at Cirtec Medical's facility in Lowell, MA, US; cathode manufacturing initially remaining at Ilika's UK facility as a sub-contracted service to Cirtec.\n\u00b7\nCommenced production\nof Stereax batteries for product testing and initial deliveries.\n\u00b7\nContinuing to liaise with our portfolio of 21 customers\nincluding advising on power management integration into their applications, leveraging Cirtec's platform technology portfolio.\nGoliath (EV Applications)\n\u00b7\nReceived customer validation\nof 1st generation P1 prototype batteries confirming they, \"\nperform to specification, putting them in the cohort of leading solid-state batteries\n\".\n\u00b7\nSecured further \u00a31.25m grant funding\nfrom the UK Government's DRIVE35 programme to produce Goliath A-Samples on industrial equipment, working with the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre with steering support from JaguarLandRover and the University of Oxford.\n\u00b7\nCompleted commissioning\nof Ilika's 1.5 MWh/a pilot line, enabling delivery of larger batteries to customers for evaluation.\n\u00b7\nExpansion of pipeline\nof evaluation agreements by 29%, from 21 to 27 companies, including EV original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and Tier 1 suppliers globally, as well as an increasing number of consumer appliance and defence companies.\nFinancial Summary\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue for the period of \u00a30.6m (H1 2024/25: \u00a31.0m), reflecting grant funding of \u00a30.6m (H1 2024/5: \u00a30.9m) from the commencement of the PRIMED grant project in the current year against the completion of both HISTORY and SiSTEM grants which were active in 2024/5.\n\u00b7\nEBITDA loss, excluding share-based payments, of \u00a33.2m (H1 2024/25: \u00a31.9m loss).\n\u00b7\nSuccessful \u00a34.2 million (gross) fundraising to support the Goliath roadmap and Stereax commercialisation.\n\u00b7\nCash & Cash equivalents at period end of \u00a36.9m (H1 2024/25: \u00a310.1m).\nPost Period End\n\u00b7\nInitiated delivery of\nprototype M300 Stereax samples to customers meeting an important commercial milestone.\n\u00b7\nShipped\nprototype 10Ah Goliath cells to customers for evaluation, a 5x increase in capacity relative to the P1 prototypes which were released to customers in summer 2024.

The Company's mission is to rapidly develop leading-edge IP, manufacture and license solid-state batteries for markets that cannot be addressed with conventional batteries due to their safety, charge rates, energy density and life limits. The Company achieves this by using ceramic-based lithium-ion technology that is inherently safe in manufacture and usage, higher thermal tolerance and easier to recycle which differentiates our products from existing batteries.\nThe Company has two product lines. Its Stereax batteries which are designed for powering miniature medical implants, industrial wireless sensors and specialist Internet of Things (IoT) applications and the Goliath large format batteries designed for EV cars and cordless appliances.\nCEO's Statement\nPrincipal Activities\nIlika\ncommercialises its leading-edge intellectual property (IP) in\nSolid State Batteries (SSBs) for high performance markets\nthrough licensing supported by manufacturing\nat pilot scale. We use ceramic-based lithium-ion technology, which differentiates our products from existing batteries by offering competitive energy density and charge times, while being inherently safe and easier to recycle.\nIlika has two product lines: miniature Stereax\u00ae SSBs for powering medical devices and industrial wireless sensors in specialist environments, and large format Goliath SSBs for EVs and cordless appliances.\nReview of Period\nStereax SSBs\nIlika's miniature Stereax batteries are differentiated from other Li-ion technology through their miniaturisation, their ability to deliver high power pulses and their tolerance to high temperature.\nThese unique benefits make Stereax batteries ideal for medical implants and industrial applications. Miniature Stereax batteries enable smaller, thinner and more integrated device designs not currently possible with conventional lithium-ion batteries. Their compact, high energy-density, high power characteristics allow for use in a range of medical implant applications covering blood pressure monitoring to neuro- stimulation. Industrial automation, or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), requires low maintenance batteries with a long lifetime, often in situations that require operation at temperatures exceeding the safety rating for standard lithium-ion batteries (typically 60 degrees Celsius) and Stereax is ideally suited to achieve this.\nIlika's proprietary efficient, low temperature evaporation process delivers higher manufacturing rates than competing miniature solid-state technologies, providing an affordable alternative to conventional battery manufacturing approaches.\nStereax Manufacturing and Commercialisation\nDuring the period, Ilika continued to implement the ten-year manufacturing licence in place with Cirtec to produce the Stereax range of miniature batteries at Cirtec's facility in Lowell, Massachusetts, US. Cirtec is an industry-leading strategic outsourcing partner of complex medical devices including minimally invasive and active implantable devices. In August 2025, Ilika and Cirtec completed the manufacturing process qualification for Stereax batteries. Cathode manufacturing initially remains at Ilika's UK facility as a sub-contract service to Cirtec. As planned, commercial production runs of Stereax M300 samples were started, allowing for first customer deliveries from Cirtec facilities within 2025 calendar year.\nM300 Stereax batteries are being evaluated for a growing number of Active Implantable Medical Device (AIMD) applications, by 21 current Stereax customers. Demand from applications such as smart orthopaedics, orthodontics, neurostimulation and smart contact lenses has created opportunities in the medical device sector, which is the sector generating the strongest demand. Commercial ramp up in this space usually takes three to five years, depending on the regulatory classification of the device. Receipt of commercial Stereax product will enable our customers to initiate the formal regulatory approval process, requiring increasingly large volumes of product for validation throughout the process. Cirtec brings particular strengths to the partnership though its deep relationships in the medical device sector and the technology integration opportunities it offers with its neurostimulation platform.\nOnce economies of scale are achieved, Ilika and Cirtec are anticipating being able to address larger volume applications in specialised sectors of Industrial IoT.\nLarge Format Goliath SSBs\nIlika's Goliath cells have the potential to reduce the cost of electric vehicles, while at the same time enabling longer range with battery packs that last longer and can be recycled more easily.\nGoliath cells are differentiated from other solid-state prototype cells through the Company's choice of materials, cell architecture and manufacturing process for its cathode, electrolyte and anodes. Different developers have selected distinct combinations of these materials to achieve an outcome suitable for their target markets and Ilika has chosen materials that deliver these distinct advantages in the EV sector.\nIlika's initial target market for Goliath in automotive is the higher performance sector, which is less cost- sensitive than higher volume segments and where enhanced vehicle range commands a premium price. To address this market, Ilika is driving forward its Goliath development programme.\nAt the beginning of the period, Ilika received customer validation of its 2Ah P1 prototype batteries confirming they, \"perform to specification, putting them in the cohort of leading solid-state batteries.\" The P1 Goliath prototype is a solid-state pouch cell made from readily available materials including a lithium-nickel-manganese- cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode and a silicon anode. This progress represents an intermediate milestone on Ilika's roadmap to its minimum viable product (MVP).\nIn July 2025, Ilika announced it had secured \u00a31.25m grant funding from the UK Government's DRIVE35 programme to produce Goliath A-Samples on industrial equipment, working with the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC) with steering support from JaguarLandRover and the University of Oxford. Supported by the Advanced Propulsion Centre\u00a0UK\u00a0(APC) through its Demonstrate fund, the grant funded project is codenamed PRIMED and represents another significant step towards commercialising Ilika's innovative solid-state battery technology. The programme is utilising the electrode production facilities at the\u00a0UK\u00a0Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC). PRIMED builds upon two successful predecessor projects. The Battery Innovation Programme (formerly Faraday Battery Challenge) project HISTORY developed a 50Ah solid-state battery prototype, whilst the Automotive Transformation Fund programme SiSTEM established SSB assembly capabilities and conducted production trials at UKBIC. PRIMED will deliver several critical outcomes in H2CY26. These include the production of P2 solid-state battery prototype cells (A-Sample batteries), creation of a Production Scale Model, and a comprehensive Business Case Review for gigafactory-scale manufacturing. These deliverables will support responses to commercial requests for quotation (RFQs).\nIn October 2025, Ilika completed the successful final commissioning test of its automated assembly line marking full operational status for its pilot production facility. The automated line significantly improves manufacturing yield and product consistency, enabling Ilika to deliver the larger volumes of SSBs (up to 1.5 MWh/a) required for both internal validation and customer testing programmes.\nAt the end of 2025, Ilika used its newly commissioned pilot facilty to manufacture prototype 10Ah Goliath cells, which it shipped to customers for evaluation. 10Ah represents a 5x increase in capacity relative to its P1 prototypes which were released to customers in summer 2024.\nThese technical activities underpinned Ilika's continued interaction with a portfolio of automotive and consumer appliance original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and Tier 1 suppliers globally, resulting in a pipeline of evaluation agreements with 27 companies.\nIlika's experience working with automotive partners has shown that the industry expects suppliers to have reached what it defines as A-Sample readiness to respond to requests for quotation (RFQs). Beyond 1.5 MWh/a, at B- and C-Sample readiness and volumes, Ilika will continue to work with manufacturing partners such as UKBIC to scale to higher levels of production capacity on equipment that could be used for mass production.\nOutlook\nThe addressable markets for AIMDs are growing at a healthy pace. For example, the market for neuromodulation, addressing cognitive disorders, chronic pain, disability following a stroke and psychiatric disorders, is growing at 12.2% pa. Following the currect focus on meeting the initial order book, Ilika and Cirtec expect to secure larger volume repeat orders for Stereax in 2026, allowing both companies to ramp product sales revenue.\nDespite the sometimes gloomy media headlines concerning the EV market, the reality remains encouraging. Battery EVs accounted for 23% of new vehicle sales in 2025; when hybrids and plug-in hybrids are added to the picture, vehicles with batteries accounted for nearly half of all vehicle sales in the UK in 2025. The trend continued to ramp, with battery EVs accounting for 32% of the market in December 2025.\nIlika looks forward to working with its Tier 1 and OEM partners in 2026 to evaluate its Goliath 10Ah prototype performance and further develop its roadmap towards an MVP for the automotive market. In addition, Ilika recognises that there are earlier commercialisation opportunities in consumer appliances and defence, which the Company is closely evaluating.\nGraeme Purdy, CEO\nIlika plc\nConsolidated statement of comprehensive income for the six months ended 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n31 Oct 2025\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n31 Oct 2024\nAudited\nYear\nended\n30 Apr 2025\nNotes\n\u00a3 000's\n\u00a3 000's\n\u00a3 000's\nTurnover\n593.7\n982.1\n1,052.9\nRevenue\n4.5\n72.7\n73.5\nUK grants\n589.2\n909.4\n979.4\nCost of sales\n(428.3)\n(429.0)\n(526.2)\nGross profit\n165.4\n553.1\n526.7\nOther Operating Income\n-\n-\n-\nAdministrative expenses\nAdministrative expenses\n(4,318.9)\n(3,354.2)\n(7,559.9)\nShare-based payment charge\n(326.7)\n(292.0)\n(527.7)\n(4,645.6)\n(3,646.2)\n(8,087.6)\nOperating loss\n(4,480.2)\n(3,093.1)\n(7,560.9)\nFinancial income\n138.8\n236.9\n391.4\nFinancial expense\n(14.6)\n(12.8)\n(47.5)\nLoss before tax\n(4,356.0)\n(2,869.0)\n(7,217.0)\nTaxation\n700.0\n650.0\n1,314.8\nLoss for period/total comprehensive income attributable to owners of parent\n(3,656.0)\n(2,219.0)\n(5,902.2)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss per share\nBasic and diluted\n2\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\n(0.04)\nThe results from the periods shown above are derived entirely from continuing operations.\nConsolidated balance sheet as at 31 October 2025 (unaudited)\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n31 Oct 2025\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n31 Oct 2024\nAudited\nYear\nended\n30 Apr 2025\nNotes\n\u00a3 000's\n\u00a3 000's\n\u00a3 000's\nASSETS\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets\n5,394.5\n4,127.4\n4,719.1\nProperty, plant and equipment\n2,945.7\n3,651.9\n3,295.4\nRight-of-use assets\n329.8\n465.3\n432.1\nTotal non-current assets\n8,670\n8,244.6\n8,446.6\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n1,743.6\n3,141.3\n1,722.2\nCurrent tax receivable\n2,000.0\n1,176.2\n1,300.0\nOther financial assets -

It represents the difference between the value of the issued equity instruments of Ilika Technologies Limited immediately before the share for share exchange and the equity instruments of Ilika plc along with the shares issued to effect the share for share exchange.\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n1. Accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe interim financial statements, which are unaudited, have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRSs\") adopted by the European Union. The accounting policies are the same as applied in the Group's latest financial statements.\nThe interim financial statements do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and do not comply with all the disclosures in IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'. Accordingly, whilst the interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS they cannot be construed as being in full compliance with IFRS.\nThe financial information for the year ended 30 April 2025 does not constitute the full statutory accounts for that period. The Annual Report and Accounts for 30 April 2025 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The Independent Auditors' Report on the Annual Report and Accounts for 2025 was unqualified and did not include references to any matters which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under Section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nGoing concern\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which the directors believe continues to be appropriate. The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through existing cash resources which, at 31 October 2025, amounted to \u00a36.9m, including cash in hand at the bank (\u00a36.9m). The directors have prepared projected cash flow\u00a0information for the period ending twelve months from the date of their approval of these financial statements. On the basis of this cash flow information the directors believe that the Group will be able to continue to trade for the foreseeable future.\n2. Loss per share\nLoss per ordinary share have been calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue during the relevant financial periods. The weighted average number of equity shares in issue and the earnings, being loss after tax, are as follows:\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n31 Oct 2025\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n31 Oct 2024\nAudited\nYear\nended\n30 Apr 2025\nNumber\nNumber\nNumber\nWeighted average number of equity shares\n178,692,358\n166,124,565\n166,883,795\n\u00a3 000's\n\u00a3 000's\n\u00a3 000's\nLoss, being loss after tax\n(3,656.0)\n(2,219.0)\n(5,902.2)\nThe loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of calculating the diluted earnings per ordinary share are identical to those used for basic earnings per share. This is because the exercise of share options and warrants would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS 33.\n- Ends -\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

According to analysis by automotive experts\u00a0Balance Batteries, this technology\u00a0could\u00a0reduce battery pack weight by 20% and\u00a0cut manufacturing costs\u00a0by \u00a32,500\u00a0per vehicle.\nThe prototypes were manufactured on Ilika's automated pilot line, completed in October 2025. The automation has already shown significant benefits, with the first batch\u00a0achieving\u00a0a 93% manufacturing\u00a0success rate (yield), which is well above the\u00a0minimum\u00a0required for\u00a0moving to\u00a0full production.\nThe Company has also created initial samples of larger 50Ah P2 cells for testing, which will be available for shipping after feedback has been received on the current 10Ah cells which is expected during 2026.\nGraeme Purdy, CEO of Ilika, said:\n\"\nWe are excited that that our new automated pilot line is now producing high-quality, consistent battery prototypes for our partners to evaluate. This achievement is a significant milestone toward bringing our technology to market, further opening the window for licensing discussions with manufacturers.\"\nHead of Battery Development at a major UK automotive supplier serving global car manufacturers said:\n\"\nHere in the UK and more broadly in Europe, there is significant interest in developing technical solutions that are differentiated from the offerings available from established cell manufacturers. We look forward to evaluating these 10Ah prototypes from Ilika, which demonstrate the Company's sustained capability to improve and mature their product for commercial roll-out.\"\nThe information communicated within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018.

This achievement followed successful equipment commissioning in January 2025 and represented the final technical validation before commencement of production. The qualified manufacturing line includes sophisticated layer deposition, alignment, and patterning systems essential for producing medical-grade micro-batteries. The milestone progressed a ten-year manufacturing agreement signed in August 2023, under which Cirtec Medical will produce Ilika's Stereax battery portfolio. This collaboration combines Ilika's advanced battery technology with Cirtec Medical's established medical device manufacturing expertise to address growing demand for miniaturised medical implants. Barring any last-minute delays due to international logistics over the US-UK festive period, initial deliveries of Stereax M300 batteries to lead customers are targeted to commence in Q4 2025.\nGoliath\nGoliath batteries are large format SSBs designed for\nelectric vehicles\nand consumer appliances.\nAt the beginning of the Period, Ilika confirmed that its Goliath 2Ah P1 cells had been validated by customer testing at its OEM and Tier 1 testing partners. In July 2025, the Company announced the award of further grant support to manufacture the first Goliath A-Sample batteries for automotive applications. This support is being provided from the newly launched Demonstrate fund, facilitated by the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK, in a 12-month, \u00a33 million collaboration programme, of which Ilika is receiving \u00a31.25 million in grant funding. By September 2025, Ilika was able to confirm Jaguar Land Rover and Professor Paul Shearing of Oxford University had joined the programme in strategic steering roles.\nLast month, the Company announced it had completed commissioning of its automated assembly line, marking full operational status for its Goliath SSB pilot production facility. The automated line significantly improves manufacturing yield and product consistency, enabling Ilika to deliver the larger volumes of Goliath SSBs required for both internal validation and customer testing programmes. Following this important milestone, Ilika remains on track to begin releasing 10Ah prototypes to customers in December 2025, with 50Ah cells following based on 10Ah feedback and customer demand.\nFinancial Update:\nThe Company expects to announce revenue for the Period of \u00a30.6m (H1 2024/5:\u00a0\u00a31.0m), resulting from the DRIVE35 PRIMED grant funded programme which commenced in August and accelerates through the second half of the financial year. EBITDA loss, excluding share-based payments, is expected to be\u00a0\u00a33.2m\u00a0(H1 2024/5:\u00a0loss of\u00a0\u00a31.9m) for the Period, reflecting a ramp up of costs associated with developing, manufacturing and testing the Goliath 10Ah prototypes. Cash and cash equivalents at the Period end\u00a0were\u00a0\u00a36.9m\u00a0(H1 2024/5:\u00a0\u00a310.1m).\nAnalyst Briefing\nThe management team will be hosting a hybrid analyst briefing at 9.30 a.m. on 22 January 2026. Analysts who wish to attend should contact: FTI Consulting at ilika@fticonsulting.com.\nInvestor Presentation\nAn investor presentation will be held at 4.30 p.m. on 22 January 2026, and will be hosted through Investor Meet Company.\u00a0Investors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add Ilika plc via the following link:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/ilika-plc/register-investor\n.\u00a0For more information, please contact FTI Consulting at:\u00a0ilika@fticonsulting.com.\nEnquiries:\nIlika Plc\nGraeme Purdy, Chief Executive\nJason Stewart, Chief Financial Officer\nwww.ilika.com\nVia FTI Consulting\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nPeter Lynch\nNeil McDonald\n+44 (0)131 220 9772\n+44 (0)131 220 9771\nFTI Consulting (Comms Advisors)\nBen Brewerton\nElizabeth Adams\nDwight Burden\nilika@fticonsulting.com\nAbout Ilika plc\nIlika is a global expert in the development of solid-state battery technology for electric vehicles, medical devices and consumer appliances.
