A number of batteries from the initial batches will be allocated to the extensive M300 testing programme, which is designed to generate a larger body of test data relevant to exciting applications in active implantable medical devices (AIMDs). Applications include powering implanted sensors, neurostimulators, orthopaedic implants, orthodontic wearables and ophthalmology devices. With its small footprint and enhanced charging capabilities, Stereax is ideally suited to meet the needs of AIMDs, offering benefits that include: reduced surgery time, the ability to place the implant closer to the point of therapy, long-lasting performance, user recharging at home and the ability to power Bluetooth radio. Ilika and its strategic partner, Cirtec Medical Corp, will solicit feedback from this core customer group to verify customer experience before ramping production.\nThis milestone progresses the 10-year manufacturing agreement signed in August 2023, in which Cirtec Medical, a leading US medical device manufacturer, will produce Ilika's Stereax battery portfolio.\nDaniel Weinstein, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Lura Health, a provider of non-invasive health management solutions using continuous salivary monitoring, said:\n\"\nAs one of the first customers to receive M300 prototypes, we are excited to be working with Ilika and Cirtec Medical to demonstrate the deployment of Stereax miniature batteries in our range of non-invasive microsensors for salivary health markers.\"\nShawn Martin, Vice President at Cirtec Medical, said:\n\"\nThe Stereax product is an excellent addition to our world-leading capabilities in advanced miniaturised electronics designed for life-changing medical devices.\"\nGraeme Purdy, CEO of Ilika, said:\n\"\nAfter successfully transferring Stereax technology to Cirtec Medical's world-class manufacturing facility in Lowell, Massachusetts, we are looking forward to intensifying our customer engagement and servicing their needs for implantable power management devices. The applications form a market of over $40bn with high single digit CAGR, with the miniature battery component alone worth over $250m.\"\nThe information communicated within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018.

The automation has already shown significant benefits, with the first batch\u00a0achieving\u00a0a 93% manufacturing\u00a0success rate (yield), which is well above the\u00a0minimum\u00a0required for\u00a0moving to\u00a0full production.\nThe Company has also created initial samples of larger 50Ah P2 cells for testing, which will be available for shipping after feedback has been received on the current 10Ah cells which is expected during 2026.\nGraeme Purdy, CEO of Ilika, said:\n\"\nWe are excited that that our new automated pilot line is now producing high-quality, consistent battery prototypes for our partners to evaluate. This achievement is a significant milestone toward bringing our technology to market, further opening the window for licensing discussions with manufacturers.\"\nHead of Battery Development at a major UK automotive supplier serving global car manufacturers said:\n\"\nHere in the UK and more broadly in Europe, there is significant interest in developing technical solutions that are differentiated from the offerings available from established cell manufacturers. We look forward to evaluating these 10Ah prototypes from Ilika, which demonstrate the Company's sustained capability to improve and mature their product for commercial roll-out.\"\nThe information communicated within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018.

These production runs will deliver commercial samples of Ilika's M300 battery in 2025.\nIlika and Cirtec continue to promote Stereax for the growing range of AIMDs being commercialised, working closely with a portfolio of 21 customers to support their development plans and launch schedules under the 10-year licensing and technology transfer agreement that Ilika and Cirtec entered into in August 2023. Ilika and Cirtec will be jointly promoting Stereax at US conferences and trade shows in Q1 2025. The integration of Stereax batteries into sub-assemblies manufactured by Cirtec can offer MedTech customers a more complete solution, creating a faster, lower cost route to market. Sales of Stereax batteries will begin to ramp in 2025, aligned with the increasing customer demand associated with testing and approval of customer devices.\nGoliath\nGoliath batteries are large format solid state batteries designed for\nelectric vehicles\n(\"EVs\") and consumer appliances.\nIlika's Goliath programme made strong progress during the Period, with key highlights being the technical milestone verification by third party testing, increased activity with customers and the commencement of commercial customer-sponsored validation.\nDuring the period, Ilika shipped its first batch of P1 prototype Goliath batteries to a Tier 1 customer, met its D5 development milestone and released a set of third-party validated safety data demonstrating significant improvements relative to commercially available EV batteries. The benefits, which include reducing EV weight and cost while extending range, will be crucial for western OEMs as they seek to remain competitive versus cheaper Chinese imports.\nThe progress with the P1 prototype reflects the customer-sponsored testing programme that commenced in May 2024. This progress continues to have support from the \u00a38.2m grant-funded Faraday Battery Challenge in collaboration with BMW and Fortescue Future Industries, with the aim of integrating high silicon content electrodes into Goliath.\nIn parallel, Ilika has been trialling production equipment at both vendor sites and its pilot facility in the UK which is important to reduce scale-up risk and provide a basis for future process licensing. Since October 2023, this scale-up work has been supported by the Automotive Transformation Fund's \u00a32.7m grant-supported SiSTEM project, in which Ilika is collaborating with Mpac plc, the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (\"UKBIC\") and, since April 2024, Tata Sons' subsidiary, Agratas. Ilika continues to interact closely with many of the global automotive OEMs, sharing Goliath prototypes for their evaluation, as a precursor to large-scale manufacturing through licensing.\nIn addition, Ilika continues to assess non-automotive sectors for Goliath, which offer lower volume, higher margin opportunities for commercialisation.\nFinancial Update:\nFor the six months ended 31 October 2024, the Company expects to announce revenue of \u00a31.0m (H1 2023/4:\u00a0\u00a31.3m) reflecting the timing of grant funded projects. EBITDA loss, excluding share-based payments, of\n\u00a31.9m\n(H1 2023/4:\u00a0loss of\u00a0\u00a31.9m) for the Period. Cash and cash equivalents at the Period end\u00a0were\n\u00a310.1m\n(H1 2023/4:\u00a0\u00a313.2m).\nNotice of Results:\nIlika expects to announce results for the Period on Tuesday 21 January 2025.\nAnalyst Briefing\nThe management team will be hosting a hybrid analyst briefing at 9.30am, on 21 January 2025. Analysts who wish to attend should contact: FTI Consulting at ilika@fticonsulting.com.\nInvestor Presentation\nAn investor presentation will be held at 4.30pm, on 21 January 2025, and will be hosted through, Investor Meet Company.\u00a0Investors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add Ilika plc via the following link:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/ilika-plc/register-investor\n.\nFor more information, please contact FTI Consulting at:\nilika@fticonsulting.com\n.\nFor more information contact:\nIlika plc\nwww.ilika.com\nGraeme Purdy, Chief Executive\nJason Stewart, Chief Financial Officer\nVia FTI Consulting\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nomad and Joint Broker)\nTel: 020 3100 2000\nAndrew Godber, John More\nNikhil Varghese, Joshua Borlant\nJoh.

The automated line significantly improves manufacturing yield and product consistency, enabling Ilika to deliver the larger volumes of Goliath SSBs required for both internal validation and customer testing programmes.\nFurther to the outlook statement in our\nFY 2025 full year results\npublished in July 2025, Ilika's SSB pilot line is now fully operational and provides the capability and increased capacity to deliver 10Ah P1.5 prototypes (first generation 10 amp-hour batteries) and initial sampling quantities of its 50Ah P2 prototypes (second generation 50 amp-hour batteries) to customers to support their internal test programmes. Commercial test programmes require large numbers of identical cells to ensure robustness of data and these needs can now be met by Ilika utilising its own facility.\nTo further scale up 50Ah battery production to A-Sample volumes (pre-production quantities for automotive testing), as described in its\nannouncement\nin September 2025, the Company will continue its collaboration with UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC), in the PRIMED programme, supported by the Advanced Propulsion Centre with Jaguar Land Rover and HSSMI. B-Samples (pre-production samples manufactured on industrial-scale production equipment) will be produced in collaboration with licensees.\nFollowing this important milestone, Ilika remains on track to begin releasing its 10Ah P1.5 prototypes to customers in December 2025, with 50Ah cells following based on P1.5 feedback and customer demand.\nGraeme Purdy, CEO of Ilika, said:\n\"\nThe completion of the Goliath pilot line is a major milestone in our journey to commercialisation. This automation delivers the consistent performance and quality our customers require for their validation programmes, while de-risking their future scale-up to giga-scale production. This is a strong and clear step towards achieving our licencing objectives.\"\nSean Gilgun, CEO of UKBIC said:\n\"Ilika will be one of the first companies to use our new flexible pilot line, which is great news. It's hugely positive to see that their ambitious plans continue apace. This latest announcement is confirmation that Ilika has successfully completed the bridge between its own capability, our FPL and full-scale capability, to produce automotive A- and B-Samples. We look forward to further collaboration between Ilika and UKBIC in the PRIMED project.\"\nThe information communicated within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018.
