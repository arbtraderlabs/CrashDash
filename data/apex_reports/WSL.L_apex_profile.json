          "content": "30 Sep 2025 16:25\nRNS Number : 4738B\nWorldsec Limited\n30 September 2025\nWORLDSEC LIMITED\nInterim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2\n025\nWorldsec Limited\nInterim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nThe board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of directors of Worldsec Limited (the \u201cCompany\u201d) hereby submits the interim report on the Company and its subsidiaries (the \u201cGroup\u201d) for the six months ended 30 June 2025 (the \u201cInterim Report\u201d).\nFor the period under review, the Group recorded an unaudited net loss of US$97,000 (equivalent to basic and diluted loss per share of 0.11 US cent) against an unaudited net loss of US$146,000 (equivalent to basic and diluted loss per share of 0.17 US cent) for the corresponding six months in 2024. Dividend income increased by over US$100,000 to US$151,000 due primarily to the dividend received in connection with the Group\u2019s investment in ByteDance Ltd. (\u201cByteDance\u201d), held through the Homaer Asset Management Master Fund SPC (the \u201cHomaer Fund\u201d), following ByteDance\u2019s modest and measured partial share buybacks. This was, nevertheless, offset in part by a reduction in the positive contribution from the fair value change in the financial assets of the Group at fair value through profit and loss. Accordingly, a net loss narrowing of US$49,000 was recorded. Cash and cash equivalents, however, decreased by US$224,000, reflecting basically the use of funds for working capital and other operating activities.\nAt the date of the Interim Report, the investment portfolio of the Group comprises a total of six investments:\nICBC Specialised Ship Leasing Investment Fund (the \u201cICBC Ship Fund\u201d)\nThe Group\u2019s investment in the ICBC Ship Fund, which is involved in marine vessel leasing, continued to provide a stable return through monthly dividend income, generating revenue amounting to US$48,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2025.\nAnimoca Brands Corporation Limited (\u201cAnimoca\u201d) through\u00a0VS SPC Limited\u00a0(\u201cVS SPC\u201d)\nThe Group holds, through the Class A Participating Shares of VS SPC, an investment in the equity interest of Animoca.\nIncorporated in Australia, Animoca was formerly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange but was delisted in 2020. It is a holding company of a technology group engaged in gamification, blockchain and tokenisation activities and is committed to advancing digital property rights and building an open metaverse. The operations of the Animoca group encompass three integrated business pillars, comprising (i) Web3 businesses with native projects including Moca Network, Open Campus, The Sandbox, as well as a stablecoin joint venture with Standard Chartered and HKT; (ii) digital asset advisory services including tokenomic advisory, liquidity provisioning and institutional research; and (iii) investment management with a portfolio of Web3 investments in over 570 companies including industry leaders Pudgy Penguins, Yuga Labs, Axie Infinity, Polygon, Consensys, Magic Eden, OpenSea, Dapper Labs, YGG, among many others. Animoca has received broad industry and market recognitions as winners in Fortune Crypto 40, and Financial Times\u2019 High Growth Companies Asia-Pacific, Top 50 Blockchain Game Companies 2025 and Deloitte Tech Fast.\nHaving emerged from the perfect storm in 2023 and undergone foundational rebuilding in 2024, the digital asset market and the Web3 economy are experiencing a breakthrough year in 2025. Bitcoin prices have repeatedly set record highs, signaling strong market confidence. DeFi is no longer crypto-native as stablecoins have become widely accepted in cross-border payments, remittances and B2B settlements, while tokenisation of RWAs has been gaining significant traction. Financial institutions are increasingly integrating digital assets and expanding offerings through crypto ETFs. Exemplified by the enactment of the GENIUS Act in the United States, the global regulatory landscape is gradually converging towards legal clarity, fostering security, technological innovation and sustainable development within the cryptosphere and the Web3 economy. Under these favourable conditions, the Animoca group continues to strengthen its market leadership through strategic and synergistic investments, partnerships and various corporate initiatives.\nIn June 2025, after an extended delay due to the difficulty in dealing with novel and complex accounting issues associated with the crypto sector, Animoca moved a big step towards full financial disclosure compliance with the release of its 2021 Annual Report that was audited with an unqualified opinion.\u00a0Thanks to the rapidly rising contributions from the blockchain and digital asset activities, bookings, net assets and operating cash flow jumped\u00a0by orders of magnitude\u00a0to A$450 million,\u00a0A$337 million\u00a0and\u00a0A$382 million\u00a0respectively. But because of the substantial amount of non-cash accounting charges attributed to, inter alia, deferred revenue recognition, share-based compensation, derivative instrument features and fair value adjustments, a net loss of\u00a0A$671 million\u00a0was recorded. With the completion of the audit for 2021, Animoca has laid the groundwork for expediting the preparation of the outstanding audited financial statements for the subsequent reporting periods.\nCertain\u00a0strategic\u00a0and synergistic investments, partnerships and corporate initiatives executed by\u00a0the Animoca group are set out below:\nBetween June and September 2025, Moca Foundation, the community-owned entity initiated by the Animoca group\nto\nsupport the development, adoption and growth of Moca Network, and Moca Network, the chain-agnostic decentralised identity infrastructure project that provides one universal account for a user\u2019s assets, identity and reputation across multiple platforms, announced a series of strategic moves to deepen Moca Network\u2019s community engagement and broaden its reach across Web3 verticals. Moca Chain will be launched as a Layer-1 blockchain for self-sovereign and privacy-preserving user and data verification. Testnet and mainnet have been slated for late 2025. The launch of MocaPortfolio will offer MOCA Coin and Mocaverse NFT communities exposure to the ecosystem of and access to token allocations of US$20 million from the investment and partnership portfolio companies of the Animoca group.\u00a0Through the strategic partnership with Oyunfor, Moca Network\u2019s AIR Kit software development kit will be integrated into Turkey\u2019s leading e-pin and digital game-code marketplace to deliver personalised rewards and Web3 onboarding for over 6.2 million Turkish gamers. In collaboration with Spree Finance and BookIt.com, two blockchain-powered reward engines, Moca Network\u00a0will set up a verifiable loyalty platform, Air Shop, that will enable its users to earn rewards from more than 2 million merchants in travel, entertainment and premium retail. Additionally, Moca Coin was listed on Kraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to enhance the accessibility and adoption of Moca Network\u2019s ecosystem. In April 2025, Animoca and its supported education-focused decentralised autonomous organisation, Open Campus, which is the foundation\u00a0behind EDU Chain,\u00a0jointly deployed US$10 million in liquidity as loan collateral to facilitate DeFi student loans on the Pencil Finance platform. Pencil Finance is a decentralised lending protocol designed to connect investors and trusted loan originators\u00a0through tokenised bundles. It is co-incubated by Animoca and HackQuest on EDU Chain. The inaugural US$1 million tokenised bundle marks the first on-chain issuance of student loan capital, with funds allocated in tranches at fixed and variable annual percentage yield to ErudiFi for students in the Philippines and Indonesia and to Transcend Network for edtech founders and unlocking new opportunities for education financing. Through a US$20.7 million placement led by Animoca, the Animoca group became a strategic investor in DigitalX, the only crypto fund manager listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. US$19.7 million of the placement proceeds have been deployed to fund DigitalX\u2019s Bitcoin-focused treasury activities.\nAnimoca has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with DDC Enterprise, the leading Asian food platform that is listed on the NYSE American stock exchange and that has built a substantial Bitcoin treasury as a core part of its business model, and will allocate up to US$100 million Bitcoin towards DDC Enterprise\u2019s yield-enhancement strategies. Animoca\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman will also join the Bitcoin Visionary Council newly formed under DDC Enterprise to provide leadership and guidance. Animoca and Provenance Blockchain Labs have entered into a strategic partnership to co-develop NUVA, a chain-agnostic vault marketplace connecting RWA issuers with investors. Built on the Provenance Blockchain, which holds over $15.7 billion in RWAs, NUVA is scheduled to debut in the fourth quarter of 2025 with institutional-grade vaults backed by Figure Technologies\u2019 flagship digitally native products, YLDS, the SEC-registered yielding stablecoin, and HELOCs, a pool of fixed-interest rate home equity loans. Separately, Animoca has teamed up with Fosun Wealth, a digital global wealth management platform, and FinChain, an innovator in blockchain finance, to drive the development of the RWA ecosystem in Asia. The collaboration aims to bridge traditional finance with emerging Web3 capital markets and plans to distribute Fosun Wealth\u2019s RWAs via NUVA.\nAnimoca, together with Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, Fabric Ventures, a venture capital contributor, and Founders Factory, a star-up builder, have unveiled a multi-million-pound accelerator in the United Kingdom to supercharge blockchain and AI startups. The accelerator program offers founders capital funding and expert training in tokenomics, community-led go to market planning and fundraising. Backed by the United Kingdom government, the accelerator aims to position the United Kingdom as a global innovation leader by fostering product-market fit and scaling frontier technologies across the Web3 and AI sectors.\nIn line with the global trend of regulatory frameworks gradually converging towards legal clarity, Hong Kong has enacted the Stablecoins Ordinance in an effort to strengthen its crypto hub position. Having gained early mover experience through the joint participation in the HKMA stablecoin issuer sandbox since July 2024, Animoca, Standard Chartered and HKT have proceeded to establish a strategic joint venture focussing on the issuance and advancement of licensed stablecoins. The strategic joint venture, Anchorpoint, has submitted a formal expression of interest to the HKMA on 1 August 2025, the very first day the Stablecoins Ordinance becoming effective.\nThe Animoca group has officially planted its footprint in the Middle East, with a strategic presence in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to serve the rising influx of Web3 organisations entering the region, and a managing director to oversee its Middle Eastern operations has been appointed.\nThe crypto space appears to be approaching a pivotal inflection point, as regulatory frameworks around the world are gradually converging towards legal clarity. This evolving environment is accompanied by a marked change in sentiment, from an era of hostility and skepticism to one that fosters innovation in blockchain, digital asset and decentralised technologies. The enhanced global regulatory landscape is building a robust foundation for institutional adoption and broad public trust and confidence and the crypto assets are poised for mass integration into mainstream economic systems. From banking and financing, investment and smart contracting to\u00a0healthcare management, insurance fraud prevention and claims automation, identity and credential verification and beyond, blockchain-based solutions have the transformative potential to revolutionise\u00a0traditional operational practices across industries.\u00a0As a leader in the crypto space\u00a0and a pioneer at the forefront of the crypto revolution,\u00a0the Animoca group is uniquely placed to capitalise on the vast opportunities and revolutionary benefits arising in the trailblazing Web3 digital age.\nByteDance\u00a0through the Homaer Fund\nThe Group holds, through the Unicorn Equity Investment Portfolio Class A Shares of the Homaer Fund, an investment in the equity interest of ByteDance.\nIncorporated in the Cayman Islands, ByteDance is an unlisted holding company of a technology group that operates a series of mobile app platforms powered by AI across cultures and geographies. The ByteDance group has a portfolio of products and services that includes TikTok, TikTok Shop, CapCut, Lark, as well as Douyin, Douyin E-commerce, Toutiao, Xigua and Feishu which are specific to the China market, and has over 150,000 employees in nearly 120 cities around the world.\nDuring the first half of 2025, the ByteDance group continued to deliver strong financial performance amid macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Reuters reported that, for the first quarter of 2025, the Chinese technology giant achieved revenue exceeding US$43\u202fbillion, surpassing Meta\u2019s US$42.3 billion and becoming the world\u2019s number one social media conglomerate by sales. Growth momentum followed through to the second quarter of 2025. Revenue grew year-on-year by 25% to US$48 billion, most of which was derived from the domestic market. For the full year in 2025, the ByteDance group has reportedly set a revenue target with a 20 percent growth over 2024 to US$186\u202fbillion. With strong financial performance, ByteDance conducted partial investor share buybacks, albeit in a modest and measured manner, giving rise to the dividend received by the Group during the 2025 first half as mentioned in the results review paragraph above.\nByteDance has placed AI at the heart of its strategic roadmap, adopting a dual track strategy with consumer products funding and fueling the open-source technology development and the open-source innovation in turn providing the foundational capabilities to empower the growth and enhancement of the consumer applications. This virtuous cycle is exemplified by two cornerstone projects\u00a0of the ByteDance group. Seed-OSS-36B, an open-source LLM with 36 billion parameters\u00a0released under Apache 2.0, achieves state-of-the-art benchmark scores in various domains. Doubao, the consumer-facing chatbot\u00a0of the ByteDance group, has more than 150 million monthly active users to become one of China\u2019s most widely adopted AI assistants, and is seamlessly integrated across the ByteDance group\u2019s app ecosystem from Feishu to CapCut delivering fast, fluent and multimodal interactions.\nThe ByteDance group is also building a modular suite of generative AI tools that cover multiple modalities in text, image, video, audio and 3D and 4D environments, supported by a layered architecture of specialised models designed for creative generation, complex reasoning and agentic execution. Flagship components include Seedream 4.0, a unified image generation and editing model with multi-reference input and sequential storytelling capabilities, XVerse, a multi-subject image composer with token-specific modulation for fine-grained control, OmniHuman, which transforms static images into animated avatars capable of natural gestures and lip sync, and VINCIE-3B, a diffusion transformer for in-context image editing from video sequences. The modular suite of the ByteDance group is designed for interoperability, allowing outputs from one model to feed into another. This synergistic effect is amplified by the ByteDance group\u2019s massive user base across Douyin, TikTok and other mobile app platforms, enabling real-time deployment and feedback loops at scale.\nTo further advance the AI ambition of ByteDance, the ByteDance group has expanded its robotics research and development team to about 150 employees, with efforts focusing on autonomous mobile robots. Engineered for indoor material transport, the wheeled bots are actively deployed in the ByteDance group\u2019s internal operations, including TikTok and Douyin e-commerce warehouses, and have commenced servicing external logistics clients. At the frontier of embodied AI, the ByteDance group has also developed GR-3, a large-scale vision-language-action model that enables robots to understand natural-language instructions and perform sophisticated long-horizon household tasks in real-world settings. Integrated with GR-3 AI, the bimanual robotic platform, ByteMini, is capable of folding laundry, hanging clothes and clearing dining tables, showcasing human-like dexterous manipulation and spatial reasoning. By leveraging its AI expertise to build generalist robots that could assist in everyday life, the ByteDance group is expanding into consumer robots and intelligent automation.\nTo power ByteDance\u2019s ambitious vision in AI, the ByteDance group has reportedly earmarked over US$20 billion capital expenditure for 2025. The preponderance of the funds is directed towards AI infrastructure with huge spending on data centres, chip procurement, networking equipment, compute resources and cloud capacity to support the training and inference of its growing model fleet. The investments also aim to scale the ByteDance group\u2019s AI applications spanning developer tools, chatbots and image and video generators. The colossal amount of capital expenditure underscores ByteDance\u2019s deep commitment to forging a competitive AI ecosystem that will power foundational research and consumer product growth in the long term.\nMeanwhile, TikTok continues to dominate headlines. In Europe, its entrenched popularity and extensive market penetration have drawn admiration and scrutiny. With over 200 million monthly active users across 32 countries, TikTok reaches roughly one in three Europeans, solidifying the short-video platform\u2019s status as a cultural and commercial force. However, the latent influence inherent in its extensive reach has attracted regulatory attention. In May 2025, the Irish Data Protection Commission imposed a fine of \u20ac530 million on the local TikTok entity for allegedly transferring European user data to China without adequate safeguards. The short-video platform company has made an appeal contesting the \u20ac485 million and \u20ac45 million components of the penalty, with a full hearing scheduled for October 2025.\nAcross the Atlantic, TikTok faces continued regulatory challenges. Although the Canadian government has ordered TikTok\u2019s local entity to dissolve its operations over national security concerns, the short-video platform remains accessible to users. In the United States, the long-running divestiture saga of TikTok appears to be approaching a finale. After years of political pressure, wrangling and legal manoeuvring, the short-video platform has seemingly fulfilled its role as a bargaining chip in the conflict between the two economic superpowers. On 25 September 2025, President Trump signed an executive order addressing national security concerns under the 2024 ban-or-divest law by approving a US$14 billion deal to restructure TikTok\u2019s operations in the United States into an entity to be majority-owned by American investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, with ByteDance retaining less than 20% ownership and limited control. Upon the restructuring, the recommendation algorithm of TikTok will be retrained with United States user data. Data security will be monitored and overseen by Oracle. As additional time is required to complete the divestiture, the enforcement deadline of the 2024 ban-or-divest law has been extended to 16 December 2025.\nOn top of navigating a complex and fragmented regulatory landscape, TikTok is doubling down on a global push for TikTok Shop, rolling out its e-commerce platform across continental Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland, as well as Japan and Brazil throughout 2025. The ambitious and aggressive rollout represents a strategic endeavour to monetise TikTok\u2019s massive global user base, which exceeds 1.6 billion registered users, by seamlessly integrating shopping directly into the short-form video and livestream ecosystem.\u00a0The business model of\u00a0TikTok Shop uniquely blends content-driven commerce with viral engagement, enabling creators and brands to convert views into purchases in real-time. This positions TikTok as a disruptive force in the global e-commerce space, evolving from a social media platform into a full-fledged commerce engine capable of challenging incumbents such as Amazon, Rakuten and Mercado Libre.\nLikewise, Douyin, TikTok\u2019s sister\u00a0short-video app in China, has also taken steps to strengthen its market position through expansion in e-commerce and content production. In 2024, Douyin Ecommerce achieved a gross merchandise value of US$490 billion, establishing itself as China\u2019s third-largest e-tailer, behind Alibaba\u2019s Taotian Group and Pinduoduo and surpassing JD.com.\u00a0To further consolidate its presence in the fast-growing instant commerce sector, Douyin has merged Douyin Supermarket with Douyin Hourly Delivery, integrating shelf-based shopping with rapid fulfillment capabilities.\u00a0This pits Douyin Ecommerce directly against Taobao Instant Commerce, JD Instant Delivery and Meituan in the race to capture a share of China\u2019s projected US$279 billion instant retail market by 2030. Concurrently, the Chinese short video platform is actively ramping up efforts on original content production, especially in the realm of short dramas,\u00a0to enhance platform engagement and intellectual property control. It has recently set up a short drama copyright centre responsible for managing content\u00a0rights and supply with a view to improving\u00a0copyright oversight and elevate production quality.\u00a0Hongguo Short Drama, a Douyin-affiliated platform, has emerged as a leading player in China\u2019s short drama market, which had grown from US$0.5 billion in 2021 to US$7 billion in 2024 and has been projected to top US$16.2 billion by 2030.\nFrom time to time, ByteDance conducts share buybacks from the employees of the ByteDance group. For the latest round of the buyback offer slated for the autumn of the current year, it has reportedly valued itself at US$330 billion on the back of strong financial performance. Regulatory filings by major ByteDance investors actually revealed a range of valuations exceeding the US$330 billion amount.\nDingdong\u00a0(Cayman) Limited (\u201cDingdong\u201d)\nSubsequent to the listing of Dingdong on the New York Stock Exchange, the Group directly holds its investment in the American depositary shares of Dingdong (the \u201cDingdong ADS\u201d).\nDingdong is the holding company of an e-commerce group that principally operates a mobile app, Dingdong Maicai, providing users and households with fresh groceries, prepared food and other food products supported by an extensive self-operated frontline fulfillment grid. The operations of the Dingdong group cover dozens of cities across China with a significant portion of revenue derived from the Yangtze River Delta Megalopolis. The Dingdong group has also launched a series of private label products, spanning a variety of food categories mostly supported by self-operated production facilities.\nBased on the unaudited quarterly reports of the first and second quarters of 2025 filed by Dingdong with the regulatory authority (the \u201cFirst Quarterly Report\u201d and the \u201cSecond Quarterly Report\u201d), the Dingdong group maintained its growth momentum through the first half of 2025, marking six consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability and year-on-year revenue growth. In the first and second quarters of 2025, despite the decline in food prices and the continued impact of the strategic adjustments to suspend coverage of non-performing cities, revenue grew year-on-year by 9.1% and 6.7% to RMB$5.48 billion and RMB$5.98 billion respectively. This was driven by the rise in the number of orders consequent to the increase in the number of transacting users and the increased order frequency, supplemented by the network expansion to deepen market penetration in East China.\nFor the first half of 2025, and based on the calculations derived from the unaudited figures found in the First Quarterly Report and the Second Quarterly Report, gross profit margin decreased to 29.3% from 30.3% in the same period of 2024, reflecting the additional costs associated with product mix changes stemming from the implementation of the \u201c4G strategy\u201d of \"good users, good products, good services and good mindshare\" to boost customer satisfaction.\u00a0Fulfillment and other expenses, on the other hand, were effectively managed and contained. Net margin at the bottom-line, either on the non-GAAP* or the GAAP basis, therefore remained broadly unchanged. Coupled with the growth in revenue, the Dingdong group continued to deliver in the highly competitive industry. For the first half of 2025, non-GAAP net income grew year-on-year by 9.3% to a total of RMB158.2 million and GAAP net income considerably by 45.1% to a total of RMB115.2 million.\nOn the back of continued profitability, cash flow remained robust. Net cash generated from operating activities\u00a0recorded eight consecutive quarterly gains, amounting to RMB85.2 million and RMB101.4 million for the first and second quarters of 2025 respectively.\u00a0As at 30 June 2025, net cash balance,\u00a0calculated by deducting short-term borrowings\u00a0from the sum of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, stood at RMB2.95 billion, providing ample wherewithal to fund capital expenditure. Working capital, on the other hand, was practically\u00a0financed by suppliers. The ratio of accounts payable net of supplier advances to the sum of net accounts receivable and net inventory of over 2.6 times as at 30 June 2025 was a solid indicator that pointed to a negative cash conversion cycle, a classic feature of the business model of a successful grocer with strong bargaining power to secure essentially interest-free financing with extended payment terms from suppliers. Indeed, the operations of the Dingdong group have become self-sustaining and scalable.\nIn March 2025, Dingdong announced a new share repurchase program of up to US$20 million for a 12-month period until March 2026. The repurchases were expected to be funded by internal resources, yet again highlighting the enduring confidence of the Dingdong group on its financial position and cash generating capacity.\nApart from the continued efforts in expanding its online grocery business, the Dingdong group has taken a strategic step with a view to broadening and diversifying revenue streams. In collaboration with DFI, a company listed on the Equity Shares (Transition) category of the London Stock Exchange and a member of the Jardine Matheson Group, Dingdong aims to build a digitalised cross-border supply chain to offer a selected variety of competitively\u00a0priced fresh produce to Hong Kong consumers. Leveraging the nationwide sourcing and logistics capabilities of the Dingdong group alongside DFI\u2019s extensive Hong Kong retail network of\nnearly 280 Wellcome stores, Wellcome Online Shop and foodpanda on-demand platform, and with the support of AI-driven inventory management with predictive analytics and traceability technology for product transparency, the collaboration targets sales of HK$100 million for the first year. In less than a month since launch, Hong Kong consumers have reportedly purchased more than 100,000 kilograms\u00a0of vegetables of the Dingdong group via DFI\u2019s retail network.\u00a0Through the collaboration with DFI, Dingdong is positioning itself as a trusted cross-border supplier and building brand mindshare beyond its domestic market.\n* Non-GAAP measures are widely considered to be a useful indicator of the underlying business trend by excluding the non-cash charges of share-based compensation.\nSeyond Holdings Ltd. (\u201cSeyond\u201d, formerly Innovusion Holdings Ltd.) through the Hermitage Fund Twelve SP (the \u201cHermitage Fund Twelve\u201d)\nThe Group holds, through the Class A Participating Shares of the Hermitage Fund Twelve, an investment in the equity interest in Seyond.\nFounded and headquartered in Silicon Valley in California in the United States, Seyond is an unlisted holding company of a technology group that specialises in the design, development and production of automotive-grade LiDAR solutions for\u00a0autonomous driving\u00a0and other automotive and non-automotive application scenarios. The product portfolio of the Seyond group includes the ultra-long-range LiDAR, the Falcon series which utilises the 1550nm wavelength technology, the mid-range wide field of view LiDAR and the long-range LiDAR, the Robin\u00a0series which utilises the 905nm wavelength technology, the newly launched latest-generation pure solid-state LiDAR, Hummingbird D1, as well as the self-developed software platform, OmniVidi which extends the functionality of the sensor hardware, and the intelligent transport system platform, SIMPL, which is an AI and LiDAR-powered traffic management system.\u00a0According to China Insights Industry Consultancy (\u201cCIC\u201d), an independent market research and consulting firm, the Seyond group was the world\u2019s first provider of automotive-grade high-performance LiDAR solutions to achieve volume production.\nThrough the announcement made on 20 December 2024 by TechStar Acquisition Corporation (\u201cTechStar\u201d), a special purpose acquisition company listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Seyond unveiled its listing plan by way of a de-SPAC transaction with TechStar (the \u201cDe-SPAC Transaction\u201d). Subsequently, on 25 August 2025, an updated application proof in connection with the De-SPAC Transaction (the \u201cUpdated Application Proof\u201d) was published. As highlighted in the Updated Application Proof, the Seyond group had achieved significant progress in the design, development and, in particular, the commercialisation of its products. In 2022, it commenced volume production of Falcon LiDAR solutions for Nio, a leading company in the premium smart electric vehicle market and a major investor in Seyond. By 31 March 2025, the Seyond group had achieved cumulative deliveries exceeding 493,000 units of LiDARs, the majority of which were from the Falcon series and were taken up by NIO.\nSince then, in May and August 2025, Seyond has\u00a0secured two landmark contracts for\u00a0the exclusive supply of the E1X LiDAR solutions under the Robin series. The first is with a top-tier Chinese automotive group and the second with a globally renowned joint-venture automaker. This marks a pivotal step on the part of the Seyond group in diversifying its customer base beyond NIO and reducing its reliance on the Falcon series. Under the first contract, Seyond will exclusively supply the Robin E1X LiDAR solutions to multiple brands within the Chinese automotive group. Mass production of the Robin LiDAR- equipped models is scheduled to commence in 2026, with sales projected to reach hundreds of thousands of units within the next three years. The key terms of the second contract are quite similar. The Seyond group has been granted by the joint-venture automaker the exclusive supplier status for the Robin E1X LiDAR solutions, which will be integrated into hundreds of thousands of units across selected models also slated for mass production in 2026.\u00a0The securing of these crucial contracts from the industry giants is a testament to the Seyond group\u2019s technical capabilities and underscores its expanding role and rising prominence in the autonomous driving supply chain.\nAnother noteworthy achievement of the Seyond group involves the latest\u2011generation pure solid\u2011state LiDAR, the Hummingbird\u202fD1. Under a designated contract secured in July 2025, the newly launched LiDAR solutions have been selected for a high-end intelligent model of a premium brand of a top Chinese automotive manufacturer. Built on a pure solid-state electronic scanning architecture with no mechanical moving components, the Hummingbird\u202fD1 LiDAR delivers reliable and seamlessly integrated full-spectrum perception with comprehensive detection and minimal blind spots. Through the designated contract, Seyond establishes itself among the first to mass produce pure solid\u2011state LiDAR solutions for passenger vehicles.\nCertain other business deals recently executed by the Seyond group are set out below:\nWithin the autonomous driving and other automotive application sector, Seyond has also secured\u00a0from other OEMs and ADAS and ADS companies a number of design-wins, which would generally translate into sales orders in about a year.\nFor the non-automotive application sector, the Seyond group has been selling LiDAR solutions to end users and system integrators across industries, including intelligent transportation, railway, shipping, mining, industrial automation and robotics. Notably, Seyond has rapidly been expanding deployment of SIMPL, the AI and LiDAR-powered\u00a0intelligent transportation system platform that is designed to manage traffic, strengthen transport infrastructure, enhance road safety and protect lives, in the United States and Scandinavia through strategic partnerships with government and transportation agencies, distributors and integration specialists.\nIn tandem with the significant progress in business development, the Seyond group had achieved equally promising improvement in cutting losses and advancing towards sustained profitability.\u00a0Based on the draft financial information contained in the Updated Application Proof, following the commencement of the Falcon LiDAR solutions, revenue grew considerably on a sequential basis from US$66.3 million in 2022 to US$159.6 million in 2024. However, the upward revenue trajectory was temporally interrupted in the first quarter of 2025. Revenue decreased slightly year-on-year by 3.5% to US$25.3 million due primarily to a decrease in the sales of the Falcon series as the sales volume of the Falcon LiDAR-equipped vehicles of Nio experienced a dip. Nevertheless, the loss cutting trend remained intact. Gross loss was US$41.3 million in 2022, edging up slightly to US$42.4 million in 2023 as sales that had yet to turn profitable grew, before falling considerably to US$13.9 million in 2024. By the first quarter of 2025, gross profit of US$3.2 million was attained. Within a matter of three and a quarter years, gross margin went from a negative 62.4% at the beginning of mass production to a positive 12.6% on the back of the significant progress in product commercialisation. The remarkable improvement was primarily driven by cost reductions arising from product design optimisation and economies of scale enabled by volume production and increased material procurement, and demonstrated that the Seyond group was on track to achieving sustained profitability.\nMeanwhile, the De-SPAC Transaction, valued at HK$11.7 billion, represents a significant milestone for Seyond. Pursuant to, among other things, a business combination agreement dated 20 December 2024, TechStar will effectively be acquired and delisted, with Seyond emerging as the listed successor. The De-SPAC Transaction, which will include the PIPE investments grossing a total of HK$551.3 million from three parties, Huangshan Construction Investment Capital, Wealth Strategy and Zhuhai Hengqin Huagai, may also involve a placing of permitted equity financing with professional investors for an aggregate subscription amount of up to HK$500 million. The funds raised will provide the Seyond group with fresh capital for its business needs, including research and development, construction and upgrade of production facilities, global expansion and general corporate purposes. The De-SPAC Transaction is subject to, among other conditions, the approvals of the relevant regulators and the shareholders of TechStar. As additional time is needed to complete the regulatory approval process, Seyond has resubmitted the new listing application and the Updated Application Proof to the\u00a0Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on 25 August 2025. In the subsequent announcement made on 25 September 2025 by TechStar, the TechStar extraordinary general meeting in respect of the De-SPAC Transaction was expected to be convened in or around December 2025.\nAccording to the projection of CIC, the global automotive-grade LiDAR market will grow at a CAGR of 70.4% from US$2.2 billion in 2025 to US$32.1 billion by 2030. China continues to lead the adoption efforts as Chinese automotive manufacturers have been aggressively integrating LiDARs into vehicles across the premium and the mass market segments. Industry sources suggested that between 120 and 150 LiDAR-equipped models could be launched in China in 2025, overwhelmingly outpacing the 15 to 20 models in Europe and 5 to 10 models in the United States. Based on the draft financial information contained in the Updated Application Proof, the Seyond group consistently generated over 95% of revenue from the China market. Notwithstanding the various tariff and protectionist measures imposed by a host of countries, including most prominently the United States and the EU, against Chinese electric vehicles and critical components such as LiDARs, the Seyond group should therefore remain poised to tap into the rapid growth particularly in the domestic demand for LiDAR products in the years ahead.\nOasis Education Group Limited (\u201cOasis Group\u201d)\nOasis Group is a 50% joint venture of the Group. The operating subsidiary of Oasis Group, Oasis Education Consulting (Shenzhen) Company Limited (\u201cOasis Shenzhen\u201d, \u5967\u5049\u8a69\u6559\u80b2\u8aee\u8a62(\u6df1\u5733)\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), provides consulting and support services to the Huizhou Kindergarten in the Guangdong Province in China.\nWith a track record of over ten years navigating the evolving regulations and development in the education sector, the Huizhou Kindergarten continued to maintain a satisfactory level of pupil enrolment.\u00a0Following the graduation of 100 pupils in the summer of 2025, it had enrolled 55 new pupils for the academic term that commenced in September 2025. Based on the historical enrolment statistics, further admissions are expected for the academic term commencing in February 2026, thereby enabling the Huizhou Kindergarten to maintain a stable level of pupil enrolment.\nPROSPECTS\nA review of the world economic activities in the first half of 2025 revealed surprising resilience. According to the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update published by the International Monetary Fund, global growth for the year was projected at 3.0%, marking an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point compared with its earlier forecast in April 2025 when the Trump Administration initiated a new round of sweeping punitive tariff policies targeting practically all of the United States\u2019 trading partners. The positive revision was driven by, among other factors, the front-loading of trade by importers anticipating increased trade restrictions and tariffs leading to a temporary boost in trade volumes ahead of the policy implementation. However, the uncertainties stemming from repeated delays in implementing and continual adjustments to the tariff policies are likely to continue to dampen global trade performance for the remainder of the year. Combined with the enduring geopolitical tensions and the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, several premier institutions, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Barclay Investment Bank and PwC Network, have adopted a relatively conservative stance, projecting a deceleration in global economic growth to 2.9%, 2.7% and 2.6% respectively for 2025 against the 3.3% estimate in 2024 and the pre-pandemic historical average of 3.7% from 2000 to 2019. In terms of individual country, the 2025 growth projections for the major economies were somewhat mixed, with the United States at 1.9%, China at 4.8%, the Euro Area at 1.0%, the United Kingdom at 1.2% and Japan at 0.7%, down from the 2.8% and 5% estimates and up from the 0.9%, 1.1% and 0.2% estimates in 2024 respectively.\nDuring the first half of 2025, global inflation continued to decline, though at a slower pace than anticipated. The world consumer prices for the year, projected in the July 2025 World Economic Outlook Update of the International Monetary Fund, were 4.2%, a meaningful drop from the 5.6% estimate in 2024 and the 6.6% estimate in 2023. While inflation rates projected for developed economies, such as the United Kingdom at 3.1%* and Western Europe at 2.1%*, were lower than the 4.2% global average, they remained above the typical target rate of 2%, indicating pricing stickiness. In the United States, where inflation was projected at 3%*, there could be the potential for an upward rebound due to persistent cost pressures in the service sector and core goods especially under the influence of the tariff policies of the Trump Administration. In contrast, China\u2019s inflation rate remained close to zero, reflecting the weak domestic demand and subdued consumer spending weighing on price levels.\nDespite the global economic slowdown and the persistent inflationary pressures, equity markets, particularly in the United States, continue to show sustained momentum, buoyed by the AI frenzy, robust corporate earnings and expectations of monetary policy loosening which would provide increased liquidity to the financial system. On the other hand, caught in the crosscurrents of macroeconomic and geopolitical forces, global bond markets, especially the long-duration sovereign debt segment, are experiencing elevated volatility. In the United States, under the confluence of falling short-term rates, widening term premiums and investor concerns over fiscal sustainability, the yield curve has steepened sharply following a historically prolonged inversion. Meanwhile, global economic activities are slowing, labour conditions are softening, and entrenched protectionist sentiment keeps eroding productive efficiency and productivity through trade fragmentation and supply chain reshoring. Waxing political encroachment and erratic policy signals are also undermining central bank independence, fueling worries about the long-term credibility of inflation control. Under such circumstances, even as monetary policies pivot towards easing, term premiums for long-duration bonds, notably sovereign debts, are widening. This could pose as a time bomb, exacerbating the debt servicing burdens of heavily-indebted corporations and governments that could eventually trigger a wave of systemic financial instability, stress and crisis internationally.\nArmed with enormous dry powder raised during the low-interest-rate era, and with investment horizons that generally do not exceed the tenure of long-duration corporate financing, the private equity sector was largely unfazed by the widening term premiums, and instead of retreating, sought to exploit macroeconomic headwinds as opportunities to acquire attractively priced assets. Deal activities were disrupted but not derailed by the uncertainties arising from the tariff policies of the Trump Administration. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, global private equity and venture capital deal value grew year-on-year by 19% to US$386 billion in the first half of 2025. However, given dealmakers' preference for pursuing, if and when available, big and high-value deals owing to the favourable work-to-benefit ratio, deal count declined year-on-year by 6% to 6,188 transactions. AI-related investments remained the standout theme. As reported by CNBC, AI startups in the United States raised an aggregate of $104 billion in the first half of 2025, nearly matching the total of 2024. Nonetheless, this figure is dwarfed by the stratospheric scale of planned investments in AI capabilities, infrastructure and model training by global technology giants across the globe from the United States to China.\nOver the years, the Group has invested in companies in a diverse range of industries. Included in its existing investment portfolio are two frontrunning technology groups, ByteDance and Animoca, which are at the forefront of developing AI and blockchain-related technologies and are in an excellent position to benefit from the revolutionary advancements that are redefining the future of the digital age.\n*\nThe projected inflation rates for individual countries and Western Europe are sourced from the IMF DataMapper: April 2025 World Economic Outlook.\nBy order of the Board\nAlastair GUNN-FORBES\nNon-Executive Chairman\n30 September 2025\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe Group is exposed to a number of principal risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect its performance for the remaining six months of the year ending 31 December 2025 and beyond. Such risks and uncertainties, the directors believe, remain largely unchanged from those, including, in particular, target market risk, key person risk, operational risks and financial risks, set out

The addresses of the registered office and principal place of business of the Company are disclosed in the corporate information in the Interim Report.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the \u201cGroup\u201d) for the six months ended 30 June 2025 (the \u201cInterim Financial Statements\u201d) have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 (\u201cIAS 34\u201d) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union\u00a0(the \u201cEU\u201d).\nThe Interim Financial Statements do not include all of the information required in annual financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d), International Accounting Standards (\u201cIAS\u201d), Interpretations adopted by the EU, Interpretations adopted by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee and Interpretations adopted by the Standing Interpretations Committee (collectively referred to as \u201cIFRSs\u201d), and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2024.

Actual results might differ from these estimates.\n3.\nADOPTION\nOF NEW AND REVISED IFRSs\nThe Group has applied the same accounting policies in the Interim Financial Statements as in its annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, except that it has adopted the following amendments to IFRSs:\nAmendments to IAS 21\nLack of Exchangeability\nThe application of the above amendments to IFRSs in the current interim period had no material effect on the amounts reported and/or disclosures set out in the Interim Financial Statements.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n4.

Loss per share were US0.06 cent\n(2023\nearnings\nper share: US\n0.07\ncent). Net asset value per share was US\n6\n.4 cents (2023: US6.\n5\ncents).\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2024, there was a net positive change in the fair value of the Group's unlisted financial assets amounting to US$289,000. As at the end of 2024, cash and cash equivalents amounted to US$701,000, compared with US$1.12 million as at the end of 2023. The decline in cash and cash equivalents basically reflected the use of cash in operating and investment activities.\nDetailed discussion of the results and financial position of the Group is set out in the directors' report on pages 3 to 27.\nPROSPECTS\n\ufeff\nGlobal economy remained resilient in 2024, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to have grown at an annual rate of 3.2%. While the recovery trend from the COVID-19 pandemic and the era of high inflation and elevated interest rates had been encouraging, the recovery has abruptly been disrupted by a series of tariff measures introduced by the Trump Administration. On 2 April 2024, leveraging national security powers, President Trump issued an executive order imposing a new round of heightened and sweeping tariffs on goods imported from U.S. trading partners including, in particular, China. The baseline\u00a0rate was 10%. But there were also country-specific reciprocal tariffs which, in the case of China, could rise up to 245% following the Chinese retaliatory responses. Tariff revenue will, no doubt, provide a monumental source of income for the U.S. coffers, but they will inevitably have serious repercussions that could lead to an unintended consequence of what could be a prolonged period of economic uncertainty and volatility around the globe including the U.S.\nThe tariff policies under multiple executive orders issued by President Trump aim to reshore the U.S. manufacturing industry and address the trade deficits of the U.S. with its trading partners. However, the efficacy of the measures has raised serious concerns. Domestic production capability falling short of local consumption needs, compounded by labour constraints in the U.S. for lower value-added economic activities, necessitate reliance on imports, which have arguably been financed at favourably distorted pricing thanks to the status of the U.S. dollars as the de facto global reserve currency. But the tariffs, expected to cause substantial economic pain for the American consumers, are widely perceived as a consumption tax hike that could push the U.S. economy to a depressed state. The reaction from the stock and bond markets was a major sell-off with surging volatility, wiping out trillions of U.S. dollars in stocks and Treasuries and setting in motion an outflow in American financial assets as reflected by the U.S. dollar weakness. Should the outflow trend escalate into a full-blown exodus, there could be far-reaching implications, limiting the U.S. government's access to favourable rates to finance its enormous borrowings.\nEqually concerning was the Trump Administration's unilateral approach in initiating the tariffs, which disregarded World Trade Organisation rules and sparked a tariff tantrum. This could reshape the global trade order, accelerating economic fragmentation and deglobalisation, ultimately jeopardising the long-term growth and well-being of the world economy. Perhaps because of the overwhelmingly reproachful reaction from the financial markets, especially in the rout in Treasuries, the Trump Administration has begun moderating its stance and rhetoric, indicating readiness to accept concessions and reduce tariffs,\neven\nthough the situation continues to be highly fluid with tariff policy shifts occurring at an unprecedented pace. Moreover, whether successful negotiations on bilateral deals with U.S. trading partners, China in particular, could be reached remains uncertain. Amid these unsettling uncertainties, forecasting growth is a daunting task, requiring a multitude of assumptions that could become inapt under the ephemeral tariff policy shifts. Nonetheless, the International Monetary Fund has published a revised global economic growth forecast from 3.3% to 2.8% for 2025, while the World Trade Organisation has sharply downgraded its 2025 global trade growth forecast from a 2.7% expansion to a 0.2% contraction.\nPrior to the disruptions triggered by the tariff policies of the Trump Administration, private equity acquisition and exit activities rebounded in 2024, with total global deal volume rising by 22% to US$1.7 trillion from US$1.3 trillion in 2023. The decline in interest rates helped narrow valuation gaps, and reasonable discounts in valuation attracted investors to new investments. Improved market conditions also provided exit opportunities, particularly for those private equity firms with large investment portfolio inventories. However, the introduction of the tariffs poses new hurdles and challenges. The momentum of the private equity market in 2024, although carried into early 2025, will inevitably be disrupted. But with massive dry powder accumulated during the ultra-low interest rate era, the large-capitalisation funds are expected to seize opportunities for bargain deals, particularly from those needed to raise liquidity. Among industries, automobiles, machinery, industrial equipment and chemicals are\u00a0likely to be more affected, while technology, especially AI, services, healthcare and renewables\nshould be able to fare better. Given its longer-term investment horizon and holding power, the private equity sector may be less impacted by the uncertainties associated with the tariff war compared to the broader economy.\nNOTE OF APPRECIATION\nI wish to thank my fellow directors and staff for their efforts and contributions made during the year ended 31 December 2024. I would also like to extend a note of appreciation to shareholders for their continued support of the Company.\nAlastair Gunn-Forbes\nNon-Executive Chairman\n29 April 202\n5\nDIRECTORS' REPORT\nThe directors submit the annual report of the Company and the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nPRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\nThe principal activity of the Company is investment holding. The Company and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in investment in unlisted companies in the Greater China and South East Asian region.\nRESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION\nThe audited consolidated loss\nof the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 20\n24\nwas US$\n55\n,000\n, compared with a profit of US$\n58\n,000\nin 2023.\nLoss\nper share was US\n0.\n06\ncent (2023 earnings per share: US\n0.07\ncent).\nThe\ncorresponding 2023 profit figures were substantially boosted by the gain from the disposal of one of the Group's investee companies.\nIn the absence of any meaningful disposal contribution, the loss for 2024 essentially represented operating expenses that were partially offset by a net positive change amounting to US$289,000 in the fair value of the Group's unlisted financial assets under what was a mostly lacklustre investment climate in the Greater China and South East Asian region.\nDuring the year under review, the Group's Investment in the ICBC Specialised Ship Leasing Investment Fund (the \"ICBC Shipping Fund\") continued to provide a stable return, generating dividend income totalling US$96,000. In addition, there were dividends aggregated from its stock market investment portfolio that amounted to US$22,000.\nAs at 31 December 20\n24\n, the net assets of the Group stood at US$\n5.\n43\nmillion (2023: US$\n5.50\nmillion). Net asset value per share was US\n6.\n4\ncents (2023: US\n6.5\ncents).\nReflecting basically\nthe use of\ncash in operating and investment activities, cash and cash equivalents declined to US$701,000 from US$1.12 million a year ago.\nFurther details of the Group's results and financial position are set out in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income on page\n34\n, the consolidated statement of financial position on page 35 and notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages 39 to70.\nThe Board does not propose to declare any dividend for the year ended 31 December 20\n24\n(2023: nil).\nREVIEW\nThe Company is a closed-ended investment company listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under the Closed-ended Investment Funds segment governed by UKLR 11 of the UK Listing Rules published by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (the \"UKLR\"). In accordance with the Company's investment policy, a copy of which is set out on page\n71\n, the investment strategy of the Group focuses on investing in small to medium sized trading companies based mainly in the Greater China and South East Asian region with a view to building a diversified portfolio of minority investments in such companies. The investment objective of the Company is to achieve attractive investment returns through capital appreciation on a medium to long term horizon. To spread the investment risk of the Group, none of the Group's investments\nat the time when made\nexceeded 20% of its gross assets.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nAs at the date of this report, the investment portfolio of the Group strategically spans six sectors, namely shipping and maritime finance, gaming, blockchain and the Web3 economy, mobile app platform technology, social e-commerce and AI, online grocery and food retail, LiDAR solutions and autonomous driving, as well as education, with a view to ensuring sectoral diversification. The Group's investments include the ICBC Shipping Fund, Animoca Brands Corporation Limited (\"Animoca\"), ByteDance Ltd. (\"ByteDance\"), Dingdong\n(Cayman) Limited (\"Dingdong\"), Seyond Holdings Ltd. (\"Seyond\", formerly Innovusion Holdings Ltd.) and Oasis Education Group Limited (\"Oasis Education\"), with operations across China and international markets. This diversified approach aligns with the Company's investment objective of achieving medium to long term capital appreciation while mitigating the investment risk of the Group.\nICBC Shipping Fund\nThe Group's investment in the ICBC Shipping Fund,\nwhich is involved in shipping and maritime finance,\ncontinued to provide a stable contribution generating dividend income amounting to US$96,000 for\nthe year ended 31 December 2024\n.\nAnimoca through VS SPC Limited (\"VS SPC\")\nThe Group holds, through the Class A Participating Shares of VS SPC, an investment in the equity interest of Animoca.\nIncorporated in Australia, Animoca was formerly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange but was delisted in 2020. It is a holding company of a technology group engaged in gamification and blockchain activities with operations across three integrated business pillars comprising (i) Web3 businesses with native projects including Moca Network, Open Campus, Anichess, GAMEE, The Sandbox, NEOM Web3 initiatives, as well as a regulated stablecoin venture in partnership with Standard Chartered and HKT; (ii) digital asset advisory services including tokenomic advisory, liquidity provisioning and institutional research for the Web3 space; and (iii) investment management with a portfolio of crypto, blockchain and Web3 investments in over 540 companies including industry leaders Pudgy Penguins, Yuga Labs, Axie Infinity, Polygon, Consensys, Magic Eden, OpenSea, Dapper Labs, YGG, among many others. The Animoca group has broad industry and market recognitions as winners in Fortune Crypto 40, and Financial Times' High Growth Companies Asia-Pacific, Top 50 Blockchain Game Companies and Deloitte Tech Fast.\nAfter weathering and emerging from the\nharsh crypto winter marred by widespread sell-offs, contagion concerns and frauds in the\ncryptosphere\n, the digital asset market and the Web3 economy continued to improve during 2024. The improved environment had a positive impact on the operations of the Animoca group.\u00a0According to the unaudited financial information disclosed in the investor update released by Animoca on 5 March 2025, bookings\n1\nof the Animoca group increased by 12% to US$314 million for the year ended 31 December 2024, with contributions of US$110 million from Web3 businesses, US$165 million from digital asset advisory services and US$39 million from investment management. Operating expenses, on the other hand, decreased by 12% to US$217 million, thanks to cost reduction efforts and deployment of new AI tools. As at 31 December 2024, cash and stablecoin balances, digital assets and off-balance sheet token reserves\n2\nstood at US$293 million, US$538 million and US$2.9 billion, respectively.\n1\na non-IFRS measure commonly used in the gaming space to better represent the underlying business trend by including deferred revenue\n2\nnot classified as assets under IFRS\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nCertain recent business highlights of the Animoca group are set out below:\n(i) Web3 Businesses\nMoca Network\n\u00b2\nMoca Network is a chain-agnostic digital identity infrastructure project that\nprovides one universal account for a user's assets, identity and reputation across multiple ecosystems, and is powered by MOCA Coin, which serves as the utility token for data generation, storage, verification for users, AI agents and decentralised autonomous organisation governance.\n\u00b2\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, the Animoca group announced a number of key Moca Network partnerships that included collaborations with SYMBIOGENESIS, SK Planet, Plume\nand Soneium in various Web3, blockchain and digital identity projects.\n\u00b2\nIn November 2024, Animoca secured an extra US$10 million funding, in addition to the previous financing of a total of US$31.88 million, to fast-track and scale Moca Network's operations.\n\u00b2\nFollowing the announcement of the partnership between Moca Network and SK Planet, one of South Korea's largest information and communication technology platforms, MOCA Coin was listed on two major\ndigital asset\nexchanges in\nSouth Korea,\nUpbit and Bithumb, in December 2024.\nOpen Campus\nand TinyTap\n\u00b2\nOpen Campus is a community-led decentralised autonomous organisation\nthat operates an on-chain education network and is\nbacked by Animoca and TinyTap.\nTinyTap is a social platform that enables the creation, sharing and monetisation of interactive educational games and lessons.\n\u00b2\nIn October 2024, Open Campus announced plans to enter the student finance sector and tokenise the US$2.2 trillion student finance market.

This initiative reflects Animoca's enduring confidence in Hong Kong's potential as a global hub for Web3 infrastructure and digital innovation.\nIn a general meeting of shareholders held on 23 December 2024, the appointment of Hall Chadwick as the Animoca group's auditor was approved. Hall Chadwick\nhas experience in accounting standards relevant to digital asset transactions and has the resources necessary to assist Animoca in complying with financial reporting requirements.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nByteDance through the Homaer Asset Management Master Fund SPC (the \"Homaer Fund\")\nThe Group holds, through the Unicorn Equity Investment Portfolio Class A Shares of the Homaer Fund, an investment in the equity interest of ByteDance.\nByteDance is an unlisted holding company of a technology group that operates a series of mobile app platforms powered by AI across cultures and geographies. The ByteDance group has a portfolio of products that are available in over 150 markets and 75 languages and that includes, among others, Douyin, Toutiao, TikTok, Xigua Video, Helo, Lark and BytePlus.\nByteDance demonstrated resilient financial performance in 2024, outperforming its peers despite a sluggish Chinese economy and amid persistent geopolitical challenges. Fuelled by Douyin's dominance in livestream e-commerce and TikTok's expanding monetisation capabilities, the ByteDance group was reported to have achieved a year-on-year increase of 29% in revenue. International revenue growth surpassed domestic performance, surging 63% to US$39 billion to account for 25% of total sales. Net profit was reported to have reached US$33 billion.\nCapitalising on this financial foundation, ByteDance has prioritised AI ambitions at the core of its strategic focus. The ByteDance group holds an exceptionally advantageous position, benefiting from a staggering accumulation of data derived from a host of massive user bases associated with the mobile apps it has successfully developed over the years. This big data trove is the linchpin to advancing the AI ambitions of ByteDance.\nDuring 2024, the ByteDance group allocated capital expenditure in AI-related research and development amounting to US$11 billion, nearly the combined total of that of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as highlighted in a research note published by a major Chinese securities firm. Projections for 2025 indicate a doubling of AI-related capital spending to US$22 billion, targeting key investments in computing infrastructure and advanced model development. Additionally, in complementing its technical roadmap and to assuage geopolitical concerns, TikTok was reportedly planning to invest US$8.8 billion in data centres in Thailand over the next five years.\nMeantime, the ByteDance group continued to expand its AI product portfolio:\nPowered by the Daubao large language model family (the \"Doubao LLM Family\") and offering capabilities ranging from creative content generation to enterprise-grade data analysis, Doubao AI chatbot had attracted over 70 million monthly active users by December 2024, according to the mobile Internet business intelligence service provider QuestMobile. Having been integrated into, among others, Douyin and with a low cost of usage as well as a freemium access model, Doubao AI chatbot has solidified its role as a gateway to the AI ecosystem of the ByteDance group.\nThe Doubao LLM Family, which has developed 12 specialised models designed to address specific challenges, serves as the backbone of the AI infrastructure of the ByteDance group, powering applications in natural language processing, speech synthesis and code generation. The model framework has, through the utilisation of the Mixture-of-Experts machine learning technique and hybrid precision training, introduced the ultra-sparse memory network technology to reduce costs and improve training efficiency and inference speed. The newly enhanced flagship version, Doubao 1.5 Pro, excels in AI reasoning and knowledge representation, particularly in Chinese language tasks. The Doubao LLM Family has reportedly been integrated with eight of the mainstream automotive brands and into more than 300 million smart devices in China with usage surging 100-fold during the second half of 2024.\nDeveloped by the ByteDance group, Trae is an AI-powered programming tool that enhances coding efficiency through smart code generation, real-time task automation and workflow streamlining and supports cross-language programming. The China-specific version, powered by Doubao-1.5-Pro and launched in March 2025, became China's first AI-native integrated development environment software suite, excelling in context-aware debugging and regulatory-compliant hybrid cloud deployment.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nThe AI commercialisation strategy of the ByteDance group has also evolved to start embracing converged hardware-software ecosystems. The Ola Friend smart headphones, equipped with Doubao's real-time translation engine, achieves 150-millisecond bidirectional Mandarin-English latency, a delay claimed to be less than that of Google Pixel Buds Pro, owing possibly to the use of localised infrastructure rather than global cloud processing. On the other hand, even though the AI-powered companion toy, Xianyanbao, has only been introduced by the ByteDance group as a gift item and has yet to be officially launched as a commercial product, it has gained favourable publicity and popularity for blending education, entertainment and companionship through interactive engagement and shows good future market potential.\nIn pursuit of building a robust AI research foundation to navigate the evolving technological landscape in the long term and to sustain long-term development and growth, Dr. Yonghui Wu, a veteran Google researcher with expertise in, among others, machine learning and natural language processing, has been appointed to lead the newly formed Seed Edge team at the ByteDance group. This marks a pivot in the strategic direction of ByteDance to seek broader innovation goals. Separate from the division that focuses on metric-driven product application development with a near-term contribution objective, the Seed Edge team under the leadership of Dr. Yonghui Wu is set to concentrate on foundational and theoretical artificial general intelligence research towards long-term intelligence optimisation that could have far-reaching implications in the highly competitive technological landscape.\nAside from the AI business expansion, the ByteDance group continued to maintain a strong foothold in the mobile app space. Douyin and TikTok became the first non-gaming apps generating an aggregate of US$6 billion in annual gross in-app purchase revenue in 2024. This figure was more than double that of any other app or game during the same period. In fact, the two platforms set a new quarterly record, generating US$1.9 billion in gross in-app purchase revenue in the fourth quarter last year.\nAdditionally, driven by strategic recalibrations and targeted global expansion efforts, the social e-commerce segment of the ByteDance group also performed well in 2024. Domestically, Douyin e-commerce recorded GMV of US$478 billion last year, representing a 35% year-on-year growth, as revealed in the ByteDance group's 2025 all-hands meeting. This performance solidified Douyin's position as China's third-largest e-commerce platform, trailing only Alibaba's Taotian Group and PDD Holdings. Internationally, TikTok Shop achieved global non-China GMV of US$32.6 billion, according to video commerce data analytics firm Tabcut.com. The U.S. was TikTok Shop's largest single-country market with a 28% GMV contribution. The South East Asian region, led by Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, collectively accounted for 69% of global non-China GMV, cementing its role in leading the expansion of TikTok Shop.\nOn the geopolitical front, TikTok remains a thorny subject in the U.S. On January 17 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, authorising the TikTok ban unless ByteDance divests its U.S. operations by January 20 2025. However, President Trump intervened on his first day in office by issuing an executive order to delay the ban enforcement for 75 days, extending the enforcement date to April 5 2025. But the thorny situation, which was reportedly on the verge of a resolution, was abruptly further complicated by a new round of heightened and sweeping tariff measures unveiled by the Trump Administration against a host of trading partners including China. While President Trump issued a second executive order on April 4 2025 for another enforcement delay until June 19 2025, TikTok was unfortunately caught in middle of the trade war being used as a bargaining chip between the two economic powerhouses. This became an added uncertainty for the TikTok divestiture deal. Nonetheless, TikTok maintains 170 million monthly active users in the U.S. and retained its position as the U.S.'s second-most-downloaded app with 52 million downloads in 2024 according to Sensor Tower. But because of the tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, sales of China-related platforms including TikTok Shop in the U.S. have begun to fall as U.S. price-sensitive consumers perforce adjust their shopping habits of low cost online purchasing ahead of the end of the\ntariff de minimis exemption for items valued below US$800 on 2 May 2025.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nFrom time to time, ByteDance conducts share buybacks from the employees of the ByteDance group. In March 2025, the buyback offer was priced at\u00a0$189.90 per share, valuing ByteDance at US$315 billion. Moreover, based on information contained in regulatory filings and estimates from various sources, a number of major ByteDance investors have reportedly revalued ByteDance at more than US$400 billion. Accordingly, an upward revaluation, albeit on a conservative basis, leading to a positive change in the carrying value of the Group's investment in ByteDance held through the Homaer Fund\nhas been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nDingdong\nSubsequent to the listing of Dingdong on the New York Stock Exchange, the Group directly holds its investment in the American depositary shares of Dingdong (the \"Dingdong ADS\").\nDingdong is the holding company of an e-commerce group that operates a mobile app, Dingdong Maicai, providing users and households with fresh groceries, prepared food and other food products supported by a self-operated frontline fulfillment grid with over 40 regional processing centres and more than 1000 frontline fulfillment stations on leased properties. The operations of the Dingdong group cover 25 cities across China with a significant portion of revenue derived from the Yangtze River Delta Megalopolis. The Dingdong group has also\nlaunched a series of private label products\nspanning a variety of food categories\nmostly supported by self-operated production facilities.\nDuring 2024, the Dingdong group achieved a significant financial breakthrough with both non-GAAP net income\n3\nand GAAP net income reaching record highs. Based on, among others, the 2024 audited consolidated financial statements filed by Dingdong with the regulatory authority, revenue grew year-on-year for four straight quarters to an annual total of RMB23.1 billion (US$3.16 billion) on the back of the continued expansion in the fulfillment station network in the Yangtze River Delta Megalopolis and thanks to the increasing number of monthly transacting users and the increasing frequency of monthly purchases per user. Gross profit margin was largely maintained at around the 30% level. Consequent of the improved operational efficiency arising from the increase in order volumes and the continued improvement in the layout of the regional processing centres, fulfillment expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 23.5% in 2023 to 22.0% in 2024. This had a particularly beneficial impact on the highly competitive and thin-margin operations of the Dingdong group. Non-GAAP net income\n3\n, which had registered nine consecutive quarterly profitability, surged over eightfold year-on-year to reach a record high of RMB422.9 million (US$57.9 million) in 2024, while GAAP net income achieved the first annual profitability at RMB304.4 million (US$41.7 million) during the same period.\n3\na non-GAAP measure widely considered to be a useful indicator of the underlying business trend by excluding the non-cash charges of share-based compensation\nLikewise, with record-breaking profits, coupled with the optimisation of capital usage and financing structure, cash flow performance was equally impressive.\nCash generated from operating activities, which had registered six consecutive quarters of net inflow,\nhit a net inflow record of RMB929.0 million (US$127.3 million) for 2024. This had further strengthened the financial position of the Dingdong group, raising net cash balance, calculated by deducting short-term borrowings from the sum of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, to RMB2.85 billion (US$389.9 million) by the year end.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nDuring 2024, 130 new frontline fulfillment stations were opened in the Yangtze River Delta Megalopolis, surpassing the original target of 110. In the fourth quarter last year, the number of monthly transacting users and the\nfrequency of monthly purchases per user increased by 16% and 3% year-on-year to 7.74 million and 4.2 times, respectively, representing two of the key drivers that contributed to revenue growth. Operational efficiency also improved, as reflected by a two-minute reduction in the average order fulfillment time to 34 minutes. This has further enhanced the competitiveness of the Dingdong group in the highly competitive and thin-margin online grocery and food retail industry.\nNotwithstanding the financial breakthrough of the Dingdong group with record-breaking profits underpinned by robust operational performance, and despite a rather short-lived rebound during the fourth quarter of 2024, the price of the Dingdong ADS resumed its disappointing trend and plummeted sharply amid the panic selling triggered by the new round of\nheightened\nand sweeping tariff measures unveiled by the Trump Administration. Nevertheless, with an exposure solely to the domestic market in China and operating in an industry that provides staple goods and daily necessities to the mass public, the Dingdong group is in a relatively safe position to navigate through the economic impact and challenges of the unfolding tariff war. This apparent disconnect between the price of the Dingdong ADS and the underlying fundamentals of the Dingdong group appears to have developed into a characteristic normal for the online grocery retailer.\nSeyond\nthrough the Hermitage Galaxy Fund SPC attributable to the Hermitage Fund Twelve\nSP (the \"Hermitage Fund Twelve\")\nThe Group holds, through the Class A Participating Shares of the Hermitage Fund Twelve, an investment in the equity interest of\nSeyond\n.\nFounded and headquartered in Silicon Valley in California in the U.S., Seyond is an unlisted holding company of a technology group that specialises in the design, development and production of automotive-grade LiDAR\nsolutions for autonomous driving and other automotive and non-automotive application scenarios. The product portfolio of the Seyond group encompasses (i) hardware products that primarily include the ultra-long-range LiDAR sensors, the Falcon series which is based on the 1550nm wavelength technology, and the long-range/wide field-of-view LiDAR sensors, the Robin series which utilises the 905nm wavelength technology; and (ii) the OmniVidi perception software suite that extends the functioning of the sensor hardware. According to China Insights Industry Consultancy (\"CIC\"), an independent market research and consulting firm, the Seyond group was the world's first provider of automotive-grade LiDAR solutions to achieve volume production.\nThrough the announcement made on 20 December 2024 by TechStar Acquisition Corporation (\"TechStar\"), a special purpose acquisition company\u00a0listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Seyond unveiled its listing plan by way of a de-SPAC transaction with TechStar (the \"De-SPAC Transaction\"). As detailed in the announcement and the application proof for the De-SPAC Transaction subsequently published on 26 February 2025 (the \"Application Proof\"), the Seyond group had achieved significant progress in recent years. In 2022, it began volume production and delivery of automotive-grade LiDAR solutions for Nio, a leading company in the premium smart electric vehicle industry and a major investor in Seyond. Over the years, the Seyond group had strengthened its production capabilities with facilities in Suzhou, Deqing and Pinghu in China, alongside a dual-supplier system to ensure stable and high-quality component access. By improving operational efficiency and leveraging economies of scale, it had streamlined production processes, reduced costs and enhanced gross margins. Beyond automotive applications, its LiDAR solutions have also been incorporated and applied in various non-automotive application scenarios including smart transportation and mining. By September 2024, the Seyond group had delivered more than 391,000 units of automotive-grade LiDARs, primarily of the Falcon series, substantially to Nio with the rest to other original equipment manufacturers and had secured and established a leadership position in the market.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nBased on the draft financial information contained in the Application Proof, the Seyond group recorded revenue of US$118.5 million and gross losses of US$18.0 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared with US$84.6 million and US$31.3 million for the last corresponding period. This continued to demonstrate a sequential revenue growth and a loss narrowing trend in comparison with the previous figures of US$121.1 million and US$42.4 million in 2023 and US$66.3 million and US$41.3 million in 2022, respectively. The steady improvement reflected gross loss margin narrowing from 62.3% to 15.2% in less than three years due principally to cost reduction arising from product design optimisation and economies of scale enabled by volume production and increased supply procurement. While the Seyond group was expected to achieve positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024, customer concentration on Nio and product concentration on the Falcon series are likely to remain.\nBut focusing on strategic customers and core products is a common strategy, especially in the early development stage, for autonomous driving solution suppliers, aiming to prioritise revenue stability with limited product offerings. Additionally, the Seyond group has developed an established and mutually beneficial relationship with Nio which, apart from being the Seyond group's major customer, is also a major Seyond investor.\nThe De-SPAC Transaction, valued at HK$11.7 billion (US$1.50 billion), represents a significant milestone for Seyond.\nPursuant to, among others, a business combination agreement dated 20 December 2024, TechStar will effectively be acquired and delisted, with Seyond emerging as the listed successor. The De-SPAC Transaction, which will include PIPE investments grossing a total of HK$551.3 million (US$70.7 million) from three parties, Huangshan Construction Investment Capital, Wealth Strategy and Zhuhai Hengqin Huagai, may also involve a placing of permitted equity financing with professional investors for an aggregate subscription amount of up to HK$500 million (US$64.1 million). The funds raised will provide the Seyond group with additional capital for its business needs, including research and development, construction and upgrade of production facilities, global expansion and general corporate purposes. The De-SPAC Transaction is subject to, among others, the approvals of the relevant regulatory authorities and the shareholders of TechStar.\nDuring 2024, the Seyond group acquired two notable certifications, showcasing its commitment to automotive cybersecurity and functional safety standards.\nHaving fulfilled the audit requirements, the Suzhou production facilities of the Seyond group officially received the ISO/SAE 21434 certification issued by T\u00dcV Rheinland. This accreditation validates compliance with the global standards for automotive cybersecurity, covering the entire process lifecycle from product design and procurement to production and maintenance, and underlines the Seyond group's ability to offer network security aligned with industry best practices for smart connected vehicles.\nThe Suzhou production facilities of the Seyond group were also recognised as the world's first LiDAR manufacturer awarded the ANAB-accredited ISO 21448:2022 SOTIF certification issued by the Chinese branch of Exida. This accreditation addresses safety of the intended functionality with the implementation of safety measures to prevent or mitigate hazardous events stemming from performance limitations, insufficient specifications and human errors for autonomous driving solutions.\nVarious other prestigious certifications earned by the Seyond group over the years in safety, quality and information security include ISO 26262 ASIL D, IATF 16949, ISO 9001, ISO/IEC 27001 and TISAX AL3.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nAccording to CIC, the global LiDAR market was estimated to have reached US$4.0 billion in 2024 and projected to further grow to US$65.2 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of 59.5%. China continues to lead the adoption efforts as Chinese automakers have been aggressively integrating LiDARs into vehicles across the premium and the mass market segments. Industry sources suggest that between 120 and 150 LiDAR-equipped vehicle models could be launched in China in 2025, overwhelmingly outpacing the 15 to 20 models in Europe and 5 to 10 models in the U.S. Based on the draft financial information available from the Application Proof, the Seyond group generated over 95% of revenue in China. Likewise, its major customer, Nio, derives sales primarily in the Chinese market. Notwithstanding the escalations in the tariff war between the U.S. and China, the Seyond group should therefore remain poised to tap into the rapid growth in the demand for LiDAR products.\nOasis Education Group Limited (\"Oasis Education\")\nOasis Education is a 50% joint venture of the Group. The operating subsidiary of Oasis Education, Oasis Education Consulting (Shenzhen) Company Limited\n(\n\u5967\u5049\u8a69\u6559\u80b2\u8aee\u8a62\n(\n\u6df1\u5733\n)\n\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\n,\n\"Oasis Shenzhen\"), provides consulting and support services to the Huizhou Kindergarten in the Guangdong Province of China.\nWith a track record of over ten years navigating the evolving regulations and development in the education sector, the Huizhou Kindergarten continued to maintain a stable level of pupil enrolment. Following the graduation of\n85\npupils in the summer of 20\n2\n4\n, it had enrolled\n53\nnew pupils for the academic term that commenced in September 202\n4\nand another\n24\nnew pupils for the academic term that commenced in February 202\n5\n. This had enabled the Huizhou Kindergarten to keep the level of total pupil enrolment of over 200.\nPROSPECTS\nThe financial markets are not only displeased with the tariff policies of the Trump Administration but are also confused and unsettled by the ephemeral on-and-off approach. The idea of using tariffs as a means to reshore manufacturing activities back to the U.S. is viable if the cost structure makes commercial sense. This would require, among others, an abundant and inexpensive labour force available and prepared to work on traditional old-economy legacy industries and a relatively weak U.S. dollar.\nThe paper \"A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System\" by Mr Stephen Miran (the \"Paper\"), the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, argues that persistent U.S. dollar overvaluation distorts global trade and may provide insights into future policy direction of the Trump Administration.\nIn brief, the Paper advocates using tariffs to strategically influence global trade dynamics and compel U.S. trading partners to adjust their currency policies. The persistent overvaluation of the US dollar, stemming from the U.S. dollar's de facto global reserve currency status and driven by inelastic demand for U.S. reserve assets, undermines the competitiveness of American exports while benefiting imports. To address the trade imbalances between the U.S. and its trading partners, the Paper outlines various policy tools including tariffs, currency adjustments and national security measures. It further proposes a new international agreement, modelled after the 1985 Plaza Accord, which would coordinate a controlled weakening of the U.S. dollar. The policy tools outlined in the Paper somewhat appear to be consistent with the policies the Trump Administration has been adopting.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nUnder the 1985 Plaza Accord as mentioned above, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany and Japan agreed to address the trade imbalance issue through coordinated efforts by depreciating the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen and German Deutsche Mark. To achieve the U.S. dollar depreciation, the participating nations committed to intervention in the currency market. Germany and Japan also implemented policies to boost domestic demand and the U.S. pledged to reduce its federal deficit. Although the coordinated efforts under the 1985 Plaza Accord did lead to a reduction the U.S.'s trade deficit with Germany, the impact on the trade imbalance between the U.S. and Japan was not significant. Since then, the financial landscape has undergone considerable changes. Back in the 1980s, central banks wielded greater control over currencies and interest rates. Over time, however, financial markets of the 2020s tend to play a much more influential role in shaping the economies.\nAs a result, a similar intervention may face considerable challenges in attempting to achieve the intended outcomes.\nFurthermore, the Paper did not appear to address a root cause of the U.S. deficits, widely attributed to be a shortfall in domestic production capacity unable to meet local consumption needs. The imbalances, consequently, have to rely on imports. The financial markets are also concerned about the rout and the apparent erosion of the previously almost unchallenged confidence in Treasuries, which could undermine the U.S. dollar's global reserve currency status and limit the U.S. government's access to favourable rates to finance its enormous borrowings.\nFollowing the resounding backlash from investors and the alarming feedback from senior business leaders, the Trump Administration has softened its stance, showing increasing willingness to accept concessions and lower tariffs. The situation, nevertheless, remains highly fluid with tariff policies shifting at an unprecedented pace.\nOn the corporate front, the uncertainties emanating from the ephemeral tariff policy shifts under the Trump Administration have created chaos and thrown businesses into disarray. Companies are facing order cancellations, shipment refusals, delivery acceptance rejections, sourcing disruptions and the burden of intensified compliance monitoring. Strategic decisions have also stalled. This could have serious adverse and detrimental effects on trade and economic growth. In fact, the World Trade Organisation has sharply downgraded its global trade growth forecast from a 2.7% expansion to a 0.2% contraction for 2025. Likewise, the International Monetary Fund has revised its 2025 global economic growth forecast from 3.3% to 2.8%. The economic growth outlook for the U.S. and China also been slashed from 2.7% to 1.8% and from 4.8% to 4.0%, respectively. These downward revisions highlight the risk of a recession should the tariff war persist.\nThe private equity sector will not be immune from the uncertainties emanating from the Trump Administration's tariff polices. However, certain industries, such as technology, especially AI, services, healthcare and renewables are expected to continue to attract new commitments. Leading technology companies, particularly those in the U.S. and China, have been reported to have earmarked colossal amounts of capital expenditure for AI-related research and infrastructure, including model training, semiconductor and hardware development, data centres, cloud computing and quantum information processing. A number of the Group's investments are involved in the fields of AI or other technologies. Several of them, notably Dingdong, as well as Seyond and Bytedance, also derive all or the majority of sales from the domestic market in China. They should therefore be better placed to navigate through the economic impact and challenges of the unfolding tariff war. Despite these unsettling uncertainties, the Board will continue to seek new opportunities to expand the investment portfolio of the Group in alignment with the Company's investment policy.\nDirectors\nThe directors during the year under review and up to the date of this report were and are:\nNon-Executive Chairman\nAlastair GUNN-FORBES *\nExecutive Directors\nHenry Ying Chew CHEONG\nErnest Chiu Shun SHE\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nNon-Executive Directors\nMark Chung FONG*\nMartyn Stuart WELLS*\nStephen Lister d'Anyers WILLIS*\n* independent\nBrief biographical notes of the directors serving at the date of this report are set out on pages 72 to 74.\nSave as disclosed in this report and in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements on page\n69\n, none of the directors had during the year under review or at the end of the year a material interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nMessrs Alastair Gunn-Forbes, Mark Chung Fong and Martyn Stuart Wells have served on the Board for more than nine years. (In accordance with Provision 10 of the UK Corporate Governance Code on corporate governance published in January 2024 by the Financial Reporting Council of the United Kingdom (the \"Code\"), Messrs Alastair Gunn-Forbes\n,\nMark Chung Fong and Martyn Stuart Wells retired by rotation and were re-elected to office by separate resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting held on\n10\nSeptember 202\n4\n). During the past\nte\nn-year period, however, none of them has had any major interest in the issued share capital of the Company, has been an employee or involved in the daily management of any of the Group companies, or has had any material relationship with any of the Group companies or any of the major shareholders or managers of any such companies other than being a member of the Board. Accordingly, the Board has determined that their independence and objectivity have not been impaired and that they will therefore be able to\ncontinue to act independently in character and judgement.\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on 29 September 2014, shareholders approved the inclusion of the Group's non-executive directors as eligible participants of the Worldsec Employee Share Option Scheme 1997 (the \"Option Scheme\")\nwhich was revised on 24 September 2014. As explained in the 2014 annual report of the Company, the reason for such inclusion was to enable the Group to reward its non-executive directors for their commitments to the Company beyond the nominal annual fees that the Group could afford to pay during its development stage. Accordingly, and in accordance with Provision 10 of the Code, given that such circumstances have basically remained unchanged as the Group has yet to make a profit on a consistent basis under an era marked by a challenging environment, the Board has determined that the participation of Messrs Alastair Gunn-Forbes, Mark Chung Fong\n,\nMartyn Stuart Wells\nand\nStephen Lister d'Anyers Willis\nin the Option Scheme will not affect their ability to act independently in character and judgement.\nApart from the Option Scheme, the Group also operates a bonus scheme (the \"Bonus Scheme\"), which was approved by shareholders at the Special General Meeting held on 30 August 2013. All directors and employees of the Group are eligible to participate in the Bonus Scheme. Up to 20 per cent. of the operating profit, before payment of tax, of the Group in each financial year (the \"Bonus Pool\") may be employed in paying bonuses to directors and the Group's employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. In making decisions on the award of bonuses, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration an individual's overall performance and contribution to the business of the Group. Award of bonuses are entirely discretionary and the Remuneration Committee may elect to award only part of the Bonus Pool if the Remuneration Committee sees fit. No director or employee of the Group is contractually entitled to a share of the Bonus Pool, and the Bonus Pool may be awarded in its entirety to a single director or employee should the Remuneration Committee so resolve.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nDIRECTORS' INTERESTS\nThe interests of the individuals who were directors during the year under review in the issued share capital of the Company, including the interests of persons connected with a director (within the meaning of Sections 252, 253 to 255 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006 as if the Company were incorporated in England), the existence of which was known to, or could with reasonable diligence be ascertained by, that director, whether or not held through another party, were as follows:\nAt 1 January 2024\nAt 31 December 2024\nNo. of shares\nNo. of shares\nAlastair Gunn-Forbes\n45,000\n45,000\nHenry Ying Chew Cheong (Note)\n11,722,620\n11,722,620\nMark Chung Fong\nNil\nNil\nErnest Chiu Shun She\n550,095\n550,095\nMartyn Stuart Wells\nNil\nNil\nStephen Lister d'Anyers Willis\n16,000\n16,000\nNote:\nMr Henry Ying Chew Cheong (\"Mr Cheong\") wholly owns HC Investment Holdings Limited (\"HCIH\").

The control measures that have been put in place cover key areas of operations, finance and compliance and aim to manage rather than eliminate risks that are inherent in the running of the business of the Group. Accordingly, the Group's\nsystems of internal control and risk management are expected to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements, loss or fraud.\nAmong the control measures, the key steps that have been put in place include:\n- the setting of the investment strategy and the approval of significant investment decisions of the Group by the Board to ensure consistency with the investment objective and compliance with the investment policy of the Company;\n- the segregation of duties between the investment management and accounting functions of the Group;\n- the adoption of written procedures in relation to the operations of the bank accounts of the Group;\n- the adoption of written procedures to deal with conflicts of interests and related party transactions;\n- the maintenance of proper accounting records providing with reasonable accuracy at any time information on the financial position of the Group;\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\n- the review by the Board of the management accounts of the Group on a regular basis; and\n- the engagement of external professionals to carry out company secretarial works for the Company and to assist the Group on compliance issues.\nThe Board considers the identification, evaluation and management of the principal risks faced by the Group under the changing environment to be an ongoing process and has kept under regular review the effectiveness of the Group's systems of internal control and risk management. The Board is satisfied that the arrangements that have been put in place represent an appropriate framework to meet the internal control and risk management requirements of the Group.\nThe Board ensures oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities, and through its board meetings, aligns the Company's investment strategy with emerging environmental challenges, integrating climate considerations into investment decisions while holding senior management accountable for assessing and addressing risks across assets. Strategically, the Company evaluates climate impacts across short, medium and long-term horizons. Short-term risks include heightened regulatory pressures on high-carbon investments, while medium-term challenges involve transition risks such as evolving investor preferences toward sustainable assets. Over the long term, the focus shifts to capitalising on opportunities in renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure and low-carbon technologies to enhance returns and align with global net-zero objectives. Climate risks are managed through scenario analysis, assessing impacts of 1.5\u00a1\u00e3C and 2\u00a1\u00e3C warming scenarios and prioritising mitigation strategies.\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe Group adopts a risk management strategy that encompasses the proactive detection and assessment of emerging risks. Its internal control and risk management framework is designed to be dynamic and responsive with a view to enabling prompt adaption to new challenges and opportunities.\nThe process adopted by the Group for identifying emerging risks involves the monitoring and review of the Group's control measures and operating procedures and activities, the scanning of the development and evolving trends across various sectors including the economic, political and investment domains and the leveraging of industry information and insights relevant to the Group's operations. Potential threats identified are assessed, analysed and evaluated and, where appropriate, mitigation measures, such as those described in the paragraphs below on pages 18 to 19, would be implemented.\nThe Board receives updates on emerging risks and conducts regular review to ensure that the risk management and mitigation efforts are effective and aligned with its oversight. The Audit Committee also plays a crucial role, providing additional scrutiny and guidance on risk-related matters.\nIn the risk assessment undertaken, the Board has identified the\nprincipal risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the Group which include:\nTarget market risk\nUnder the investment policy of the Company, the Group focuses on investing in small to medium sized trading companies based mainly in the Greater China and South East Asian region. Consequently, a severe economic downturn, heightened political uncertainties, escalating geopolitical rivalries or disruptive international policy shifts negatively affecting these target markets could seriously undermine the Group's investments leading to substantial losses for the Group. This is certainly a risk factor beyond the Group's control. Nevertheless, in line with the investment policy of the Company, the Board would remain committed to investing in and maintaining a diversified portfolio in order to spread the investment risk of the Group.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nInvestment opportunity risk\nNotwithstanding the challenges in fundraising in recent years, the private equity sector continued to hold abundant dry powder accumulated during the ultra-low interest rate era. And with the onset of the easing cycle in monetary policies among major economies, albeit complicated by capricious policy uncertainties with sweeping global effects, the cost of capital has started to moderately decline. Under such an environment, competition for quality deals is expected to remain vigorous and intense. This would limit the availability of attractive investment opportunities for the Group. However, the Company has maintained a broadened investment policy. This would offer greater flexibility for the Group to make investment choices from a broader range of opportunities to achieve the Company's investment objective.\nKey person risk\nAs the Group does not engage any external investment manager, the Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's investment management activities with frontline management duties delegated to the executive directors. The Group is therefore heavily dependent on the executive directors' abilities to identify and evaluate investment targets, execute and implement investment decisions, monitor investment performance and execute and implement exit decisions. Both of the executive directors, Messrs Henry Ying Chew Cheong and Ernest Chiu Shun She, have entered into a letter of appointment with the Company with a termination clause of not less than\nsix-month written notice. Moreover, Mr Cheong is also the deputy chairman and a\nmajor\nshareholder beneficially holding a substantial interest\nin the Company's issued share capital.\nOperational risks\nThe Group is exposed to various operational risks that are inherent in the running of its business, including, among others, the failure to comply with the investment policy of the Company, the failure to prevent misstatements, loss or fraud due to inadequacies in the Group's internal operational processes, and the failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations by the Group. As mitigating measures, the Board has established and maintained systems of internal control and risk management to safeguard the Group's interests and assets, details of which are set out in the section headed \"Internal Control, Risk Management and Financial Reporting\" on page 17.\nFinancial risks\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks, including market risks, credit risk and liquidity risk, which arise from its operating and investment management activities. The Group's management of such risks is coordinated at the office of\nWorldsec Investment (Hong Kong) Limited, the principal operating subsidiary of the Group,\nin close cooperation with the Board. Details of the Group's approach on financial risk management are described in note 5(b)\nto the consolidated financial statements on pages\n5\n2\nto 5\n6\n.\nCOVID-19 pandemic risk\nAfter battling with the COVID-19 pandemic for a number of years, the world has basically returned to normality, or rather, settled down in a new normal under the legacies of the health crisis that include a profound change in the daily lives of a vast proportion of the population across the globe. Furthermore, in the post-pandemic era, with an expanding armamentarium of vaccines and therapeutics in the fight against the disease, the threat of the coronavirus to economic and business activities is generally considered to be manageable. Against this backdrop, the Group would strive to maintain a diversified portfolio geographically and across industries in order to minimise any adverse impact that may be caused by\nthe resurgence of new waves of infections or the emergence of new variants from time to time.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nVIABILITY STATEMENT\nThe directors have assessed the viability of the Company for the three years to 31 December 2027.\nThe directors consider that, for the purposes of this viability statement, a three-year period is appropriate taking into account the Group's investment horizon under its investment strategy. Besides, there should unlikely be any significant change to most of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group over the timeframe selected for the assessment.\nIn assessing the viability of the Company and its ability to meet liabilities as they fall due, the directors have taken into consideration, among others:\n- the investment strategy of the Group;\n- the current position including the existing financial status and cost structure of the Group;\n- the prospects of and the industry outlook for the Group;\n- the economic, political and geopolitical factors that could adversely affect the Greater China and South East Asian region, the primary target markets in which the Group focuses its investments; and\n- the potential adverse impact of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and the effectiveness of the mitigating measures that have been put in place, details of which are described in the section headed \"Principal Risks and Uncertainties\" on pages 18 to 19.\nThe directors note, in particular, that the Group:\n- has a liquid amount of unrestricted cash and bank balances;\n- does not have any borrowings;\n- does not have any commitments other than certain leases with modest lease liabilities; and\n- has low operating expenses with a small but stable team under stringent cost control.\nAccordingly, the directors are confident that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the assessment period.\nGOING CONCERN\nAfter making careful enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2024, that there was a reasonable expectation that the Group would have adequate resources to carry out its operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approving the consolidated financial statements. For this reason, the directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs a company listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, its business is subject to the principles contained in the Code, a copy of which is available on the website of the Financial Reporting Council of the United Kingdom. The Board confirms that, throughout the accounting period from 1 January to 31 December 2024, the Group complied with the relevant provisions of the Code, apart from certain exceptions set out and explained below.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nThe Board, comprising a non-executive chairman, three non-executive directors and two executive directors, is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance. All non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. All directors are able to take independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties, if necessary.\nThe Board is responsible for establishing strategic directions and setting objectives for the Company and making significant investment decisions and monitoring the performance of the Group. The management is responsible for the day to day running of the Group's operations.\nThe Board recognises the importance of a healthy corporate culture and its impact on the performance and reputation of the Group. As a small organisation with a stable workforce, the Group has identified and implemented a number of measures, including the monitoring and review of cultural metrics and workplace behaviours as well as the gathering and collection of employee engagement feedback. The Board from time to time discusses the outcomes of these measures to ensure that the Group's corporate culture is aligned with its core values and objectives.\nThe Board also recognises the importance of the contribution of the workforce of the Group. In this connection, an incentive program, including the Bonus Scheme, details\nof which are set out on page 14\n, and the Option Scheme, details\nof which are set out in\nnote 25 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 68 to 69, has been put in place. In addition, the Group's approach to incentivising its workforce extends beyond financial rewards. Embracing the evolving trends of the workplace, the Group offers flexible working arrangements. This initiative supports work-life balance and has improved employee satisfaction. Remote work, flexible working hours and compressed workweeks allow staff members to tailor work schedules to fit their personal needs.\nAt the end of the period under review,\nthe Company\nhad not met the gender diversity targets of having (i) at least 40% of the individuals on the Board to be women; and (ii) at least one of the senior positions, including the chair, the chief executive, the senior independent director, or the chief financial officer, on the Board to be held by a woman. On the other hand, three members of the Board were Asian/Asian British.\nGiven the Group's small-scale operations which have yet to achieve a track record of consistent profitability, the Group has encountered difficulties in meeting the gender diversity targets as woman candidates with appropriate experience and qualifications to fill board positions are highly sought-after.\nSince the end of the period under review, there have been no changes to the Board that have affected the Company's ability to meet the gender diversity targets.\nTable for reporting on gender identity or sex\nNumber of Board members\nPercentage of the Board\nNumber of senior positions on the Board (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair)\nNumber in executive management\nPercentage of executive management\nMen\n6\n100\n100\n2\n100\nWomen\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNot specified / prefer not to say\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nTable for reporting on ethnic background\nNumber\nof Board members\nPercentage\nof the\nBoard\nNumber\nof senior positions on the Board (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair)\nNumber in executive management\nPercentage\nof executive management\nWhite British or other\nWhite (including minority-white groups)\n3\n50\n1\n0\n0\nMixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nAsian/Asian British\n3\n50\n0\n2\n100\nBlack/African/Caribbean/\nBlack British\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nOther ethnic group,\nincluding Arab\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nNot specified/ prefer\nnot to say\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nBoard and executive management diversity data was collected directly from the directors and the executive management through voluntary self-disclosures of their gender and ethnicity\nand was only used for the purposes of preparing the information required to be disclosed under UK\nLR6.6.6\nR (9)\nand\n(10)\nof the\nUKLR\n.\nBOARD MEETING\nThe Board held\nfour\nmeetings during the year under review and the table below gives the attendance record.\nDirector\nBoard Meeting\nAlastair Gunn-Forbes\n3\n/4\nHenry Ying Chew Cheong\n4/4\nErnest Chiu Shun She\n4/4\nMark Chung Fong\n4/4\nMartyn Stuart Wells\n4/4\nStephen Lister d'Anyers Willis\n4/4\nAlthough the Board notes the requirement for a Nomination Committee (Provision 17 of the Code) to make recommendations to the Board on all new board appointments and to reassure shareholders of the suitability of a chosen director, the Board considers that, due to its small size and limited level of activities, it is not necessary to establish such a committee. The Board as a whole remains responsible for ensuring that a transparent, formal and rigorous process would be followed for any future board appointments, which would be made following a full review of the Board's balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge. The Board is satisfied that appropriate succession planning is in place for appointments to both the Board and senior management.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nAgain, due to its small size and limited level of activities, the Board has not appointed a senior independent director and did not consider an annual self-evaluation to be required during the year under review. The responsibilities normally rested with a senior independent director have been reverted to the Board as a whole. These decisions will be re-considered annually by the Board.\nThe Board established both an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee upon the re-activation of the Group's business in 2013. Details of these committees are set out below.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe Audit Committee held\ntwo\nmeetings during the year under review and the table below gives the attendance record.\nDirector\nAudit Committee Meeting\nMark Chung Fong\n2/2\nMartyn Stuart Wells\n2/2\nStephen Lister d'Anyers Willis\n2/2\nThe Audit Committee is chaired by Mr Mark Chung Fong and its other current member\ns are\nMessrs Martyn Stuart Wells\nand\nStephen Lister d'Anyers Willis\n. The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board and the committee's membership is comprised wholly of non-executive directors.\nThe terms of reference of the Audit Committee (copies of which are available at the Company's registered office and the Company's website) generally follow, where applicable, those stated in the provisions of the Code.\nThe Audit Committee meets a minimum of two times a year and may be convened at other times if required. The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include, among others, the examination and review of the Group's risk management, internal financial controls and financial and accounting policies and practices, as well as overseeing and reviewing the work of the Company's external auditor, their independence and the fees paid to them.\nThe Audit Committee has a formal process in place to assess the independence and effectiveness of the external audit. This process includes an evaluation of the\nCompany's external\nauditor's compliance with relevant ethical and independence guidelines, the robustness of their audit plan and the thoroughness of their audit report. In assessing independence, the Audit Committee also considers the tenure of the\nCompany's external\nauditor and their lead audit partner. In addition, feedback from the management involved in the audit is solicited to gauge the effectiveness and impartiality of the external audit process.\nDuring the year under review, the activities undertaken by the Audit Committee in discharge of its duties and functions included (i) the review and recommendation to the Board of the reappointment of\nBDO Limited\nas the Company's external auditor; (ii) the review and recommendation to the Board for approval of the annual report of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2023; and (iii) the review and recommendation to the Board for approval of the interim report of the Company and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the six months ended 30 June 2024. In recommending the reappointment of BDO Limited, the Audit Committee has taken into consideration, among others, BDO Limited's independence, objectivity and terms of engagement.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nSubsequent to the year end, the activities that have been undertaken by the Audit Committee in relation to 2024 included (i) the review and recommendation to the Board of the annual report of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2024; (ii) the monitoring of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal financial controls; and (iii) the assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process through feedback from the management involved in the audit and through interactions with and observations and review of the level of audit services provided.\nAs the scale of the operations of the Group remains relatively insubstantial, the Board has decided and the Audit Committee concurs that it would not be necessary or cost-effective to set up an internal audit function.\nIn the absence of an internal audit function, internal assurance is achieved through the implementation of systems of internal controls and risk management, details of which are set out in the section headed \"Internal Control, Risk Management and Financial Reporting\" on page 17. These control measures are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The Audit Committee also reviews both internal assurance and external audit findings to ensure a cohesive approach to financial integrity and risk management.\nIn connection with the review of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2024\n, the Audit Committee has identified and reviewed two issues which it considered significant and details on these matters are set out in the table below.\nSignificant Reporting Issue\nReview and Assessment\nImpairment review of the Group's interests in respect of its 50% owned joint venture, Oasis Education - At 31 December 2024, the Group had an equity interest of US$43,000 in and an amount of US$257,000 due from Oasis Education. These carrying amounts were significant in the Group's context and their valuations were subject to judgements, estimation uncertainties and assumptions.\nThe Audit Committee has (i) reviewed the operational and financial performance and the latest development of Oasis Education and its subsidiary; and (ii) assessed the assumptions underlying the cash flow projection for Oasis Education and its subsidiary as well as the reliability of such projection by comparing relevant historic budgets with actual results.\nValuation of investments classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (\"FVTPL\") categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy - At 31 December 2024, the Group had interests in the ICBC Shipping Fund, Animoca, ByteDance and Seyond, all of which were accounted for as financial assets at FVTPL categorised within the level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, totalling US$\n4,023\n,000 and carried at fair value. These carrying amounts were significant in the Group's context and their valuations were subject to judgements, estimation uncertainties and assumptions\n.\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the operational and financial performance and the latest development of the financial assets at FVTPL categorised within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nBDO Limited was appointed as the external auditor of the Company in February 2015, since when audit services have not been tendered competitively. The Audit Committee has concluded that a competitive tender of audit services is not necessary at this time, but acknowledges that circumstances could arise where a competitive tender for audit services may be desirable. The performance of BDO Limited as the Company's external auditor will be kept under annual review, and if satisfactory, BDO Limited will be recommended by the Audit Committee for reappointment. There are, however, no contractual obligations that would restrict the Audit Committee's choice of external auditor for the Company.\nAs advised by the Audit Committee and concurred with by the Board, the annual report of the Company and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy.\nREMUNERATION COMMITTEE\nIn accordance with Provision 32 of the Code, the Company has set up a Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee held\none\nmeeting during the year under review and the table below gives the attendance record.\nDirector\nRemuneration Committee Meeting\nMartyn Stuart Wells\n1/1\nAlastair Gunn-Forbes\n0/1\nMark Chung Fong\n1/1\nStephen Lister d'Anyers Willis\n1/1\nThe Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr Martyn Stuart Wells and its other current members are Messrs Alastair Gunn-Forbes\n,\nMark Chung Fong\nand\nStephen Lister d'Anyers Willis\n. The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and the committee's membership is comprised wholly of non-executive directors.\nThe terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee (copies of which are available at the Company's registered office and the Company's website) generally follow, where applicable, those stated in the provisions of the Code. They provide for the Remuneration Committee to meet at least two times a year. However, as the Group has a very small and stable workforce, the Remuneration Committee did not consider it meaningful or necessary to hold more than one meeting during the year under review.\nThe Remuneration Committee's responsibilities include, among others, the evaluation of the performance of the executive directors and senior staff, and the comparison of the Group's remuneration policy with similar organisations in the market to form the basis for the recommendations to the Board to determine the remuneration packages, which may include the grant of share options under the Option Scheme and the grant of bonuses under the Bonus Scheme, for individual staff and director members.\nIn accordance with the Main Principle of Provision Q of the Code, no director has been involved in deciding his own remuneration.\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nDuring the year under review, the activities undertaken by the Remuneration Committee in discharge of its duties and functions included (i) the review of and recommendation to the Board to retain the Group's existing remuneration arrangements; and (ii) the recommendation to the Board not to award any bonus or grant any share options following a review of the financial performance and position of the Group. In reviewing the Group's existing remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee noted the policy and structure of the remuneration for the executive directors encompassing a low level of director's fee enhanced by the entitlements to participate in the Bonus Scheme and the Option Scheme which, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, was appropriate given that the Group\nhad yet to achieve consistent profitability.\nWORLDSEC EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTION SCHEME 1997\nThe following table discloses the movements of the outstanding share options under the Option Scheme during the year under review.\nNumber of options\nGrantee\nExercisable period\nBalance at 1 January 2024\nGranted during the year\nExercised during\nthe year\nForfeited during the year\nLapsed during the year\nBalance at 31 December 2024\nExercise price per share\n(US$)\nDirectors\n20 August 2023 to 19 February 2033\n29 November 2019 to 28 May 2029\n350,000\n1,750,000\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n350,000\n1,750,000\n0.034\n0.034\n1 June 2016 to 30 November 2025\n2,500,000\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,500,000\n0.122\nEmployees\n29 November 2019 to 28 May 2029\n300,000\n-\n-\n-\n-\n300,000\n0.034\n1 June 2016 to 30 November 2025\n450,000\n-\n-\n-\n-\n450,000\n0.122\n5,350,000\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5,350,000\nDIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)\nFurther details relating to the granting of the share options are set out in note\n25\nto the consolidated financial statements on pages 6\n8\nto\n69\n.\nRELATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS\nCommunication with shareholders is given high priority. Information about the Group's activities is provided in the annual report and the interim report of the Company which are sent to shareholders each year and are available on the website of the Company. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting at which directors are available for questions. Enquiries are dealt with in an informative and timely manner. Directors, including non-executive directors, are also available to meet with major shareholders on request.\nEXTERNAL AUDITOR\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been audited by BDO Limited.\nA resolution will be submitted to the next Annual General Meeting to reappoint BDO Limited as the Company's external auditor.\nOn behalf of the Board\nHenry Ying Chew Cheong\nExecutive Director\n29\nApril 2025\nSTATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe directors are required under the Bermuda Companies Act 1981 to prepare consolidated financial statements for each financial year. The directors acknowledge responsibility for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, which give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at the end of that financial year and of the financial performance of the Group for that year and which provide the necessary information for shareholders to assess the business activities and performance of the Group during that year. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the directors are required to:\n- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- state whether the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; and\n- prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.\nThe directors confirm that the above requirements have been met.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of\nthe Group.\nThey are also responsible for the Group's system of internal financial controls, for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of frauds and other irregularities.\nThe directors further confirm that, to the best of their knowledge and understanding, the chairman's statements on pages 1 to 2 and the directors' report on pages 3 to 27 include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the\nCompan\ny and its subsidiaries taken as a whole together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\nOn behalf of the Board\nHenry Ying Chew Cheong\nExecutive Director\n29\nApril 2025\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT\n__________________________________________________\nTO THE MEMBERS OF WORLDSEC LIMITED\n(incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability)\nREPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOPINION\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Worldsec Limited (the \"Company\") and its subsidiaries (together the \"Group\") set out on pages 34 to 70, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including\nmaterial\naccounting polic\ny information\n.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent\nfair\nly, in all material respects,\nthe consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with\nIFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the\nInternational\nAccounting\nStandards\nBoard (\"IFRS Accounting Standards\")\nand adopted by the European Union.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (\"ISAs\"). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the \"IESBA Code\"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nimpairment ASSESSMENT of interest in a joint venture and amount due from a joint venture\nRefer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements\nThe Group owns a 50% interest in a joint venture, Oasis Education Group Limited (\"Oasis Education\"), which is accounted for using the equity method\nless any impairment loss\n. The interest in this joint venture amounted to approximately US$\n43\n,000 as at 31 December 2024 and the Group's share of its losses amounted to approximately US$9\n,000\nfor the year then ended.\nIn addition, the Group has advanced an amount of approximately US$257,000 to Oasis Education as at 31 December 2024, which is subject to an impairment assessment by management.\nThe impairment assessment of investment in, and amount due from, Oasis Education is considered by us as a key audit matter due to significant judgement made by management over the assumptions on the future cash flows to be generated from the operation of Oasis Education.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)\nTO THE MEMBERS OF WORLDSEC LIMITED\n(incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability)\nKey Audit Matters (Continued)\nimpairment ASSESSMENT of interest in a joint venture and amount due from a joint venture (CONTINUED)\nOur response:\nOur audit procedures in relation to this matter included:\nObtaining an update of the latest development of Oasis Education's operation;\nAssessing the financial performance of Oasis Education based on information provided by management;\nEvaluating management's considerations of the impairment indicators of the investment in, and the amount due from, Oasis Education;\nAssessing the appropriateness of the management's assumptions concerning the future cash flows to be generated from the operation of Oasis Education; and\nAssessing reliability of the joint venture's forecast by comparing historical budget to actual performance and obtaining explanations from management on any significant variances identified.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF INVESTMENTS classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (\"FVTPL\") CATEGORISED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\nRefer to notes 5(c)(iii) and 18 to the consolidated financial statements\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Group held a number of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, with measurement categorised within the level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, totalling approximately US$4,023,000.\nThe fair value determination of these financial assets at the end of the reporting period involves the determination of appropriate valuation models as well as the selection of inputs and assumptions made by management. Different valuation models, as well as inputs and assumptions applied may lead to a significant change in the fair value of these financial assets.\nWe identified fair value determination of these financial assets as a key audit matter because it involves a high degree of estimation uncertainty and judgement; and their aggregate carrying value is material to the Group's consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)\nTO THE MEMBERS OF WORLDSEC LIMITED\n(incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability)\nKey Audit Matters (Continued)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF INVESTMENTS classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss CATEGORISED WITHIN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY (CONTINUED)\nOur response:\nOur audit procedures in relation to this matter included:\nAssessing the appropriateness of valuation methodologies applied on the fair value determination of these financial assets;\nEvaluating the reasonableness and relevance of key inputs and assumptions used in the fair value determination; and\nInvolving an auditor's expert to assist our assessment on the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions used in the fair value determination.\nOther information in the annual report\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report therein.\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nDirectors' responsibilitIES for the consolidated financial statements\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation\nand fair presentation\nof the\nse\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with\nIFRS Accounting\nStandards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThe directors are also responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process. The audit committee of the Company (the \"Audit Committee\") assists the directors in discharging their responsibility in this regard.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)\n____________________________________\nTO THE MEMBERS OF WORLDSEC LIMITED\n(incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability)\nAuditor's responsibilitIES for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. This report is made solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 90 of the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\nidentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\nobtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\nevaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\nconclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\nevaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\nplan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the work performed for the purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)\n____________________________________\nTO THE MEMBERS OF WORLDSEC LIMITED\n(incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability)\nAuditor's responsibilitIES for the audit of the consolidated financial statements (CONTINUED)\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nREPORT ON OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nUnder the UK Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (the \"Listing Rules\"), we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review in accordance with UKLR6.6.20R(2). We have nothing to report arising from our review.\nBDO Limited\nCerti\ufb01ed Public Accountants\nCHAU, Ho Kit\nPractising Certi\ufb01cate Number P08363\nHong Kong,\n29\nApril 20\n25\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nYear ended 31 December\nNotes\n2024\n2023\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nRevenue\n7\n118\n112\nOther income, gains and losses, net\n9\n430\n521\nStaff costs\n10\n(\n279\n)\n(286)\nOther expenses\n(310)\n(283)\nFinance costs\n11\n(5)\n(3)\nShare of losses of a joint venture\n17\n(9)\n(3)\n(Loss)/\nprofit\nbefore income tax expense\n12\n(55)\n58\nIncome tax expense\n13\n-\n-\n(Loss)/\nprofit\nfor the year\n(55)\n58\nOther comprehensive income, net of income tax\nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to\nprofit or loss:\nShare of other\ncomprehensive income\nof a\njoint venture\n17\n(9)\n(7)\nOther comprehensive income for the year,\nnet of income tax\n(9)\n(7)\nTotal comprehensive income for the year\n(64)\n51\n(Loss)/\nprofit\nfor the year attributable to:\nOwners of the Company\n(55)\n58\nTotal comprehensive income for the year\nattributable\nto:\nOwners of the Company\n(64)\n51\n(Loss)/earnings per share -

Unrealised losses are\nalso\neliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment on the asset transferred, in which case the loss is recognised in profit or loss.\nSubsidiaries\nA subsidiary is an investee over which the Company is able to exercise control. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: (i) power over the investee, (ii) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from the investee, and (iii) the ability to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nJoint arrangements\nThe Group is a party to a joint arrangement where there is a contractual arrangement that confers joint control over the relevant activities of the arrangement to the Group and at least one other party. Joint control is assessed under the same principles as control over subsidiaries.\nThe Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either:\n-\nJoint venture: where the Group has rights to only the net assets of the joint arrangement; or\n-\nJoint operation: where the Group has both the rights to assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.\nIn assessing the classification of interests in joint arrangements, the Group considers:\n-\nthe structure of the joint arrangement;\n-\nthe legal form of the joint arrangement structured through a separate vehicle;\n-\nthe contractual terms of the joint arrangement agreement; and\n-\nany other facts and circumstances (including any other contractual arrangements).\nJoint ventures are accounted for using the equity method whereby they are initially recognised at cost and thereafter, their carrying amounts are adjusted for the Group's share of the post-acquisition change in the relevant joint venture's net assets except that losses in excess of the Group's interest in that joint venture are not recognised unless there is a legal and constructive obligation to make good those losses.\nProfits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the joint ventures. The investors' share in a joint venture's profits and losses resulting from such transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the joint venture.\nAny premium paid for an investment in a joint venture above the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture. Where there is objective evidence that the investment in a joint venture has been impaired, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.\nThe Group accounts for its interests in joint operations by recognising its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance with its contractually conferred rights and obligations.\nRevenue recognition\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\nInterest income is accrued on a time basis on the principal outstanding at the applicable interest rate.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nLeasing\nAll leases (irrespective of whether they are operating leases or finance leases) are required to be capitalised in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but accounting policy choices exist for an entity to choose not to capitalise (i) leases which are short-term leases and/or (ii) leases for which the underlying asset is of low-value. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets and leases which at the commencement date have a lease term less than 12 months. The lease payments associated with those leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRight-of-use assets\nRight-of-use assets are recognised at cost and would comprise: (i) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liabilities (see below for the accounting policy to account for lease liabilities); (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; (iii) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and (iv) an estimate of the costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. The Group measures the right-of-use assets applying a cost model. Under the cost model, the Group measures the right-to-use at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.\nLease liabilities\nLease liabilities are recognised at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the date of commencement of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate.\nThe following payments for the right-to-use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease are considered to be lease payments: (i) fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable; (ii) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or the rate as at the commencement date; (iii) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; (iv) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and (v) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\nSubsequent to the commencement date, the Group measures lease liabilities by: (i) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability; (ii) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and (iii) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, e.g., a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate, a change in the lease term, a change in the in substance fixed lease payments or a change in assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nForeign currencies\nTransactions entered into by the group entities in currencies other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\nExchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the translation of monetary items, are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\nOn consolidation, income and expense items of foreign operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group (i.e. US$) at the average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place are used. All assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity as foreign currency translation reserve (attributed to minority interests as appropriate). Exchange differences recognised in profit or loss of group entities' separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Group's net investment in the foreign operation concerned are reclassified to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity as foreign currency translation reserve.\nOn disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are reclassified to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal.\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets acquired arising on an acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nShare-based payments\nThe Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans and the share options are awarded to employees and directors providing services to the Group.\nAll services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based compensation are measured at their fair value. These are indirectly determined by reference to the equity instruments awarded. Their value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.\nAll share-based compensation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss over the vesting period if vesting conditions apply, or recognised as an expense in full at the grant date when the equity instruments granted vest immediately unless the compensation qualifies for recognition as an asset, with a corresponding increase in the share option reserve in equity. If vesting conditions apply, the expense\nis\nrecognised over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised, if there is any indication that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates.\nAt the time when the share options are exercised, the amount previously recognised in share option reserve will be transferred to share premium. After the vesting date, when the vested share options are forfeited or are still not exercised at the expiry date, the amount previously recognised in share option reserve will be transferred to retained profits.\nTaxation\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from\n\u00a1\u00aeprofit or\nloss\nbefore income tax expense'\nas reported in the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss and other\ncomprehensive\nincome\nbecause of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. Current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nTaxation\n(Continued)\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the\ncomputation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary\ndifferences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to\nthe extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible\ntemporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if\nthe temporary difference arises from initial recognition (other than in a business\ncombination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor\nthe accounting profit.\nIn addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nThe measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities.\nFinancial instruments\n(i) Financial assets\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\nAll regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of the asset within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirely when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nFinancial instruments (Continued)\n(i) Financial assets (Continued)\nDebt instruments\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the assets and the cash flow characteristics of the assets. There are two measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:\nAmortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.\nFVTPL: Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at FVTPL, irrespective of the business model. Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at amortised cost, as described above, debt instruments may be designated at FVTPL on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.\nEquity instruments\nEquity instruments are classified as FVTPL, whereby changes in fair value, dividends and interest income are recognised in profit or loss.\n(ii) Impairment loss on financial assets\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (\"ECLs\") on financial assets measured at amortised cost. The ECLs are measured on either of the following bases: (1) 12-month ECLs: these are the ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and (2) lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to the credit risk.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nFinancial instruments (Continued)\n(ii) Impairment loss on financial assets (Continued)\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset's original effective interest rate.\nFor debt financial assets, the ECLs are based on the 12-month ECLs. However, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECLs.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information.\nThe Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.\nDespite the foregoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a debt instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the debt instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A debt instrument is determined to have low credit risk if (1) it has a low risk of default; (2) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and (3) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when: (1) the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or (2) the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.\nA financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events of default that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:\n- significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;\n- a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;\n- the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;\n- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nFinancial instruments (Continued)\n(ii) Impairment loss on financial assets (Continued)\n- the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower.\nInterest income on a credit-impaired financial asset is calculated based on the amortised cost (i.e. the gross carrying amount less loss allowance) of the financial asset. For non credit-impaired financial assets, interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount.\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amount subject to the write-off.\nSubsequent recoveries of an asset that was previously written off are recognised as a reversal of impairment in profit or loss in the period in which the recovery occurs.\n(iii) Financial liabilities\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities, depending on the purpose for which the liabilities were incurred. Financial liabilities at amortised cost are initially measured at fair value, net of directly attributable costs incurred.\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost including other payables and accruals and lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. The related interest expenses are recognised in profit or loss.\nGains or losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.\n(iv) Effective interest method\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating interest income or interest expenses over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial asset or liability, or where appropriate, a shorter period.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nFinancial instruments (Continued)\n(v) Derecognition\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the future cash flows in relation to the financial asset expire or when the financial asset has been transferred and the transfer meets the criteria for derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9\nFinancial Instruments\n.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligations specified in the relevant contract are discharged, cancelled or expire.\nImpairment of other assets\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of the following assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss or an impairment loss previously recognised no longer exists or may have decreased:\n\u2022 property, plant and equipment; and\n\u2022 interest in a joint venture\nIf the recoverable amount (i.e. the greater of fair value less costs to disposal and value in use) of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\nA reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\nValue in use is based on the estimated future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash generating unit, discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash generating unit.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n3.\nMATERIAL\nACCOUNTING POLIC\nY INFORMATION\n(CONTINUED)\nRelated parties\n(a) A person or a close member of that person's family is related to the Group if that person:\n(i) has control or joint control over the Group;\n(ii) has significant influence over the Group; or\n(iii) is a member of key management personnel of the Group or the Company's parent.\n(b) An entity is related to the Group if any of the following conditions apply:\n(i) The entity and the Group are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others);\n(ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member);\n(iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party;\n(iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity;\n(v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of the employees of the Group or an entity related to the Group;\n(vi) The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a);\n(vii) A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity); or\n(viii) The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the Group or to the Company's parent.\nClose members of the family of a person are those family members who may be expected to influence, or be influenced by, that person in his dealings with the entity and include:\n(i) that person's children and spouse or domestic partner;\n(ii) children of that person's spouse or domestic partner; and\n(iii) dependents of that person or that person's spouse or domestic partner.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nIn the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to an accounting estimate are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:\n(i) Impairment of financial assets (including amount due from a joint venture)\nThe loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses\nits\njudgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Group's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n(ii) Impairment of non-financial assets (including interest in a joint venture)\nThe Group assesses whether there are any indications of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n(iii) Fair value measurement of investments classified as FVTPL categorised within level 3 of the Fair Value Hierarchy (as defined in note 5(c))\nThe fair value of investments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period.\nD\netails of the key assumptions used and the impact of changes to these assumptions\nare disclosed in note 5(c) to\nthe consolidated financial statements\n.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n5.

These risks include market risks (including foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The policies on how the Group mitigates these risks are set out below. The Group does not enter into or trade derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nMarket risks\nThe Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and\nmarket price of the investments\n.\nThere has been no change to the Group's exposure\nto market risks or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured\n.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n5. FINANCIAL\ninstruments (CONTINUED)\n(b) Financial risk management objectives (Continued)\nMarket risks\n(Continued)\n(i) Foreign currency risk\nCertain financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group are denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant group entities, which exposes the Group to foreign currency risk. The Group currently does not have a foreign currency hedging policy. However, management monitors foreign exchange exposure and will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System in Hong Kong, HK$ is currently pegged to the USD within a narrow range, the directors therefore consider that there is no significant foreign exchange risk with respect to the USD.\nForeign currency risk arises primarily from volatility in the British Pound Sterling (\"GBP\"). The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of reporting period were as follows:\nLiabilities\nAssets\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nGBP\n86\n87\n1\n1\nThe following table details the Group's sensitivity to a 10% (2023: 10%) increase and decrease in USD against the relevant foreign currency. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in the relevant foreign exchange rate. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts its translation as at year end for a 10% (2023: 10%) change in the relevant foreign currency rate. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or a decrease in loss for the year and a decrease in accumulated losses had USD strengthened 10% (2023: 10%) against the relevant foreign currency. For a 10% (2023: 10%) weakening of USD against the relevant foreign currency, there would have been an equal and opposite impact on profit or loss for the year and on accumulated losses.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n5.

Bank deposits at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.\nThe directors consider that the exposure to cash flow interest rate risk was insignificant. Hence, no sensitivity analysis on the exposure to the Group's cash flow interest rate risk is presented.\n(iii) Price risk\nPrice risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from foreign currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment or its issuer, or\nfactors affecting all instruments.\nAll of the Group's unlisted investments are held for long term strategic purposes. Their performance is assessed at least annually against performance of any similar listed entities, based on the limited information available to the Group, together with an assessment of their relevance to the Group's long term strategic plans.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe sensitivity analysis on price risk includes the Group's financial instruments, the fair value or future cash flows of which will fluctuate because of changes in their corresponding equity prices. If the prices of the Group's equity instruments had been 5%\n(2023:\n5\n%)\nhigher/lower,\nloss\nfor the year would have\ndecreased\n/\nincreased\nby approximately US$\n21\n,000 (2023: profit for the year would have\nin\ncreased\n/de\ncreased by approximately US$11,000).\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n5. FINANCIAL\ninstruments (CONTINUED)\n(b) Financial risk management objectives (Continued)\nCredit risk\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk which could cause a financial loss to the Group due to the failures to discharge an obligation by the counterparties arises from the carrying amounts of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the consolidated statement of financial position.\nThe credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the major counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. As at 31 December 2024, approximately 100% (2023: 100%) of the bank balances were deposited with a bank with a high credit rating. Other than concentration of credit risk on liquid funds deposited with that bank, the Group did not have any other significant concentration of credit risk.\nFor other receivables, deposits and amount due from a joint venture, management makes periodic individual assessment on the recoverability based on historical settlement records, past experience and also available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. Management believes that there was no material credit risk inherent in the Group's outstanding balances of other receivables, deposits and amount due from a joint venture. None of these receivables have been subject to a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and the expected credit loss was insignificant based on the risk of default of those counterparties under 12-month ECLs approach as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023. Thus, no loss allowance was recognised as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023.\nLiquidity risk\nUltimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the\nB\noard of Directors, which has\nestablished\nan appropriate liquidity risk management framework to meet the Group's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, by regularly monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and\nby\nmatching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities\n.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n5.

Inputs used in determining fair value measurements are categorised into different levels based on how observable the inputs used in the valuation technique utilised are (the \"Fair Value Hierarchy\"):\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n5.

The Group has determined that the reported net asset value represents fair value at the end of the report period.\nThe fair value of the Group's level 3 investments in the Homaer Asset Management Master Fund SPC and the Hermitage Galaxy Fund SPC were estimated using market approach with the significant inputs being the recent market transaction prices of the underlying investment of the respective funds. The Group has determined that the recent market transaction prices represent fair value at the end of the reporting period.\nThere were no changes in these valuation techniques during the year ended 31 December 2024.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n5.

The Directors consider between 2 to 4 years to be medium term and long term to be over 4 years. The Directors intend to build an investment portfolio of small to medium sized companies based mainly in the Greater China and South East Asian regions. The Company may also take advantage of opportunities to invest in companies in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, which have close trading links with Greater China and South East Asia. Investments will normally be in equity or preferred equity but if appropriate convertible loans or preference shares may be utilised.\nThe Company has no intention to employ gearing, but reserves the right to gear the Company to a maximum level of 25 per cent. of the last published net asset value of the Group should circumstances arise where, in the opinion of the Directors, the use of debt would be to the advantage of the Company and the Shareholders as a whole.\nThe investment portfolio will consist primarily of unlisted companies but the Directors will also consider investing in undervalued listed companies, if and when such an opportunity arises. Where suitable opportunities are identified, investment in companies considering a stock market listing at the pre-initial public offering stage will be considered.\nNo more than 20 per cent. of the gross assets of the Group will be invested in any single investment. The Directors consider that opportunities will arise to invest in investee companies by the issue of new ordinary shares of the Company at a discount of no more than 10 per cent. of the mid market price at the time of agreement of their issue in exchange for new equity, preferred equity or convertible instrument in the investee company. Target sectors are financial services, consumer retail distribution, natural resources and infrastructure but the Company will seek to take advantage of opportunities in other sectors if these arise.\nThe Company's portfolio in due course will comprise at least five different investee companies, thereby reducing the potential impact of poor performance by any individual investment.\nThe Company does not intend to take majority interests in any investee company, save in circumstances where the Company exercises any rights granted under legal agreements governing its investment. Each investment by the Company will be made on terms individually negotiated with each investee company, and the Company will seek to be able to exercise control over the affairs of any investee company in the event of a default by the investee company or its management of their respective obligations under the legal agreements governing each investment. Where appropriate, the Company will seek representation on the board of companies in which it invests. Where board representation is secured in an investee company, remuneration for such appointment will be paid to the benefit of the Company thereby enhancing returns on the investment. There will be no intention to be involved in the day to day management of the investee company but the skills and connections of the board representative will be applied in assisting the development of the investee company, with the intention of enhancing shareholder value. The Company will arrange no cross funding between investee companies and neither will any common treasury function operate for any investee company; each investee company will operate independently of each other investee company.\nWhere the Company has cash awaiting investment, it will seek to maximise the return on such sums through investment in floating rate notes or similar instruments with banks or other financial institutions with an investment grade rating or investment in equity securities issued by companies which have paid dividends for each of the previous three years.\nAny material change to the Investment Policy may only be made with the prior approval of the Shareholders.\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES OF THE DIRECTORS\nThe Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the Group's affairs.\nBrief biographical notes of the directors are set out below:\nAlastair Gunn-Forbes -\nNon-Executive\nChairman\n- aged\n80\nMr Gunn-Forbes has been associated with Asian regional stock markets since 1973 when he was a fund manager at Brown Shipley Ltd.

This compares with an unaudited net profit of US$717,000 (equivalent to basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.84 US cent), which was meaningfully boosted by the gain from the disposal of one of the Group's investee companies, for the corresponding six months in 2023. In the absence of any disposal contribution, the loss for the period essentially represented operating expenses\nthat were somewhat offset by\na relatively small positive change in the fair value of the Group's financial assets under what was a mostly lacklustre investment climate in the Greater China and South East Asian region\n.\nLikewise, the decline of US$273,000 in cash and cash equivalents during the period under review basically reflected net cash used in operating activities that included\npayments to reduce the balance of other payables and accruals by US$118,000.\nAt the date of the Interim Report, the investment portfolio of the Group comprises a total of six investments\n:\nICBC Specialised Ship Leasing Investment Fund (the \"ICBC Ship Fund\")\nThe Group's investment in the ICBC Ship Fund, which is involved in marine vessel leasing, continued to provide a stable return through monthly dividend income, generating revenue amounting to US$48,000 for the six months ended 30 June 202\n4\n.\nAnimoca Brands Corporation Limited (\"\nAnimoca\") through\nVS SPC Limited\n(\"VS SPC\")\nThe Group holds an investment in the Class A Participating Shares of VS SPC, the sole underlying investment asset of which is an equity interest in Animoca.\nIncorporated in Australia, Animoca was formerly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange but was delisted in 2020. It is a holding company of a technology group engaged in gamification and blockchain activities. The Animoca group develops and publishes a broad portfolio of products that includes, notably among others, The Sandbox, a leading decentralised metaverse platform. Other key business units of the Animoca group consist of Animoca Brands KK, Blowfish Studios, Quidd, GAMEE, nWay, Pixowl, Helix Accelerator, Forj, Lympo, Grease Monkey Games, Eden Games, Darewise Entertainment, Notre Game, TinyTap, SPORTPASS, Pixelynx, WePlay Media, Anichess, Gryfyn and Azarus. The\nAnimoca group is also an active investor in crypto, blockchain-related and Web3 projects, with a broad and growing portfolio of over 450 investments that includes\nOpenSea, a leading non-fungible token (\"NFT\") marketplace, Axie Infinity, a popular Pokemon-inspired blockchain-based video game, and Dapper Labs, the developer of CryptoKitties.\nAnimoca was a Deloitte Tech Fast winner, was listed in the inaugural edition of the Fortune Crypto 40, and was named as one of the high growth companies in Asia-Pacific in a report compiled by the Financial Times and Statista in 2023.\nAs broad sector headwinds of the harsh crypto winter subsided, the digital asset market strengthened with performance improving towards the end of 2023. According to the unaudited financial information set out in the July 2024 investor update released by Animoca (the \"Animoca Investor Update\"), bookings surged by 72% to US$90 million1 and, on the back of cost reduction initiatives and despite continued business expansion, operating expenses decreased by 14% to $55 million, in the first quarter of 2024 as compared with the last corresponding period. At 31 March 2024, cash and stablecoin balances, liquid third party digital assets and off-balance sheet token reserves stood at US$291 million, US$558 million and US$1.8 billion\nrespectively.\n1\non the basis of the non-IFRS measure commonly used in the gaming space to better represent the underlying business trend by including deferred revenue\nThe Animoca Investor Update also highlighted the broadening of the business model of the Animoca group, which has diversified and expanded to comprise three key pillars\nwith synergistic benefits:\n(i) Digital Asset Advisory, which offers a full suite of advisory services for digital asset projects including tokenomics design, smart contract advisory, exchange listing support, launch strategies, decentralised autonomous organisation setup, node operations and liquidity provision. It had become the largest source of revenue, accounting for 72% of bookings in the first quarter of 2024 and would provide resilience under volatile market conditions;\n(ii) Web3 Operating Businesses, which build Web3 applications and platforms including The Sandbox and Mocaverse. It generated 22% of bookings in the first quarter of 2024, with revenue earned primarily via token and NFT sales as well as application and platform launches; and\n(iii) Investment Management, which has assembled a broad portfolio of over 450 investments in crypto, blockchain-related and Web3 projects as mentioned above.\nFurthermore, the Animoca group is expanding into a fourth pillar, which centres around blockchain and Web3 applications for large and major institutions such as NEOM, the company established under the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia for the development of a mega futuristic city at the northern tip of the Red Sea. In addition, the Animoca group\u00a0is also pursuing initiatives with stablecoins and decentralised physical infrastructure networks.\nOther recent business highlights of the Animoca group are set out below:\n\u2219\nThrough a succession of some 20 strategic investments and partnerships in recent months, the Animoca group has continued to strengthen and solidify its position as a leader and its role as a leading influencer in the rapid evolution of the digital asset landscape. Of particular noteworthy:\n\u00d8\nKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (\"KACST\") - The Animoca group has entered into a memorandum of understanding with KACST, the Saudi Arabian government organisation responsible for the promotion of science and technology, to drive the advancement of the Web3 and gaming ecosystems in Saudi Arabia. Under the strategic partnership, a physical Web3 hub would be established in Riyadh to serve as an incubator for Web3 startups and blockchain technology.\n\u00d8\nEverest Ventures Group (\"EVG\") - The Animoca group has teamed up with EVG, a Web3 venture builder, in a collaboration that would involve cross-investments in each other's projects. Animoca would back various EVG consumer products launched in 2024 while EVG would support Animoca's mission to advance digital property rights by investing in certain projects of the Animoca group including Darewise, Anichess and Mocaverse.\n\u00d8\nFutureverse - The Animoca group has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Futureverse, a leading artificial intelligence (\"AI\") and metaverse company, that aims to enhance the reach and capabilities of Futureverse's metaverse technology stack and accelerate the growth of Futureverse's token ecosystem. Animoca and Futureverse have also indicated an intention for an equity swap involving shares of each other valued at US$5 million.\n\u00d8\nAutomobili Lamborghini (\"Lamborghini \") - The Animoca group has entered into a collaboration with Lamborghini with a mission to mold and chart the future of brand engagement in the automotive industry. Gravitaslabs, a creative design studio and technology company,\u00a0and Motorverse, the ecosystem for digital vehicles, racing games and motorsport culture created by the Animoca\u00a0group, have been selected as exclusive partners for the project.\n\u2219\nAnimoca Brands KK has introduced an NFT launchpad, SORAH, which provides projects and creators with a platform to sell NFTs. Through SORAH, Animoca Brands KK aims to establish itself as a Web3 gateway to connect Japan with the rest of the world by promoting Japanese intellectual properties, such as manga and anime, and by creating content that appeals to global audience.\n\u2219\nMOCA Foundation, a community-owned entity which is part of the Mocaverse ecosystem initiated by the Animoca group, has successfully concluded the\u00a0MOCA Token aunch, raising a total of US$29.3 million in pre-deposited funds at a 12-time oversubscription (excluding guaranteed allocation). The launch took place on MocaList, a new co-branded token launchpad jointly developed by Mocaverse and CoinList, a major digital asset trading platform. Access to the launch offering was gated by Moca ID and distributed to curated communities from Mocaverse, the Mocaverse Partners Network and CoinList through various activation campaigns.\n\u2219\nOpen Campus, a community-led protocol for educators, parents and students supported by major stakeholders including Animoca and TinyTap, has successfully launched Open Campus ID (\"OC ID\"). OC ID is a decentralised identifier that empowers learners with full control over their educational identities and data. The protocol is integrated with the learning systems of participating schools and other educational institutions in the Open Campus Alliance to enable the issuance of on-chain verifiable credentials. Within a couple of months of the OC ID launch earlier in the year, over 100,000 OC IDs had been claimed. Furthermore, Open Campus and Animoca have also launched OC100 in partnership with ForbesWeb3. OC100 is a competition that seeks to identify the top educators and thought leaders in Web3, offering winners the opportunity to be spotlighted by Forbes, connect with leading Web3 innovators at OC100 events hosted by the Animoca group, and enjoy early access to Open Campus's products.\n\u2219\nAnichess,\u00a0the chess-based online strategy game of the Animoca group developed in partnership with Chess.com, a leading online chess platform, and five-time World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen, has launched\nthe\nplayer-versus-environment gameplay. Over 1 million players have registered with 150,000 daily active users having collectively solved more than 50 million chess puzzles. Anichess is planning to introduce the main game, the player-versus-player version that will feature a range of different game modes, in the latter half of 2024.\n\u2219\nThe Sandbox has successfully raised $20 million through the issuance of convertible promissory notes at a maximum pre-money valuation of $1 billion and with the same conversion terms as its existing preference shares. Meantime, The Sandbox is also in the process of developing a decentralised metaverse version for mobile devices slated to be launched in 2025.\n\u2219\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (the \"HKMA\") has selected the coalition that comprises Standard Chartered Bank, Animoca and Hong Kong Telecommunications (the \"SAH Coalition\") as one of the three participants in the stablecoin issuer sandbox, an arrangement launched by the HKMA for the testing of the services and products of institutions that plan to issue fiat-referenced stablecoins with the aim of fostering sustainable and responsible development of the stablecoin ecosystem in Hong Kong. The SAH Coalition has been chosen for its commitment in the stablecoin issuance business with a sound business plan as well as its ability to conduct operations within a controlled scope in a risk-managed manner under the sandbox arrangements.\n\u2219\nWith a prominent market position and a strong track record, Animoca was ranked as the third-leading blockchain company in 2024, according to the top 50 list of blockchain game media BlockchainGamer.biz. In addition and remarkably, three of its subsidiaries, The Sandbox, Blowfish Studios and nWay also secured a spot on the list, ranking 7th, 22nd, and 35th respectively.\nByteDance Ltd. (\"\nByteDance\") through the Homaer Asset Management Master Fund SPC (the \"Homaer Fund\")\nThe Group holds an investment in\nthe\nUnicorn Equity Investment Portfolio Class A Shares of the Homaer Fund\n, the sole\nunderlying investment asset of which is an equity interest in ByteDance.\nIncorporated in the Cayman Islands,\nByteDance is an unlisted holding company of a technology group principally engaged in the operation of a series of mobile app platforms powered by AI across cultures and geographies. The ByteDance group has a portfolio of products that is available in over 150 markets and 75 languages and that includes\n, among others,\nDouyin, Toutiao, TikTok, Xigua Video and Helo.\nAccording to the Hurun Global Unicorn List, ByteDance retained the title as the largest unicorn in the world for the third year in a row with a valuation of US$220 billion. Capitalising on the rapidly expanding livestream e-commerce trend, Douyin continued to lead the growth of the ByteDance group. As reported by Statista in February 2024, the monthly active user base of the short video app, the sister version of TikTok in China, exceeded 755 million, underscoring its widespread influence among Chinese Internet users.\nTo further expand the revenue source of Douyin, the ByteDance group is planning a strategical move to enter the bank-card-based payment sector. In this connection, it has agreed and remains on track to acquire Union Mobile Financial (\"UMF\"), a major Chinese mobile payment provider, for nearly RMB 1.4 billion. The acquisition, at a consideration comprising a base transfer price of US$750 million plus the value of net assets at the settlement date, has been awaiting regulatory approval. Should the transaction be approved, the services provided by UMF would complement the existing functionalities of Douyin and would enhance the payment and service experience for both users and merchants within the Douyin's ecosystem.\nWhile Douyin continues to march on in China, TikTok has been facing persistent challenges overseas particularly in the U.S. Regulatory obstacles have impeded the future of TikTok despite its overwhelming popularity. In response to the passing of the ban-or-divest bill by the U.S. legislature in April 2024, TikTok, ByteDance and a group of TikTok users, among others, have filed separate lawsuits against the Department of Justice in the U.S. The case has been fast tracked by a U.S. federal court for oral arguments in September 2024, and a ruling has been requested by 6 December 2024 as the legal battle is most likely to progress to the U.S. Supreme Court before the ban-or-divest deadline on 19 January 2025.\nMeantime, as the saga drags on, a TikTok ban in the U.S. has been losing American support. A survey conducted between July and August 2024 by Pew Research, a nonpartisan think tank based in the U.S. capital, found that only 32% American adults would support banning TikTop in the U.S., down from 38% last autumn and 50% in March 2023. In addition, the U.S. government has publicly acknowledged that it has no information about the Chinese government\ngaining access to the data of TikTok users in U.S. but considers that the risk of the possibility would be too great. Interestingly, notwithstanding the security concern and defying the security risk, each of President Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Harris and former President and Republican presidential nominee Trump has created an account with TikTok, which appears to\nhave ironically\nbeen embraced as a key and quintessential\u00a0political communication tool in the U.S.\nApart from the two highly popular short video apps, ByteDance has also placed AI as one of its top priorities. Notable AI efforts of the ByteDance group are summarised as follows:\n\u00d8\nDoubao AI chatbot, released in August 2023, has taken the lead topping the AI chatbot download list in China and having accumulated a monthly active user base of 26 million by May 2024 according to ByteDance. It has also been integrated into various apps, including, notably among others, Douyin. Most of its features are free to use.\n\u00d8\nThe Doubao large language model (\"LLM\") family, sharing the same name as and being the technology behind Doubao AI chatbot, has recently been launched under Volcano Engine, the cloud computing unit of ByteDance. It consists of nine versions, ranging from entry-level to top-tier editions, offering a variety of functions tailored for different applications that includes natural language processing, speech recognition and synthesis, text-to image generation and code generation assistance. Under the highly competitive environment in China with over 200 China-developed LLMs in the market, the cost of using Doubao LLM is as low as RMB0.0008 per 1,000 tokens, some 99.8% lower than that of GPT-4 of OpenAI.\n\u00d8\nGauth is an AI homework helper with more than 10 million downloads in Google Play Store and has consistently been ranked among the top educational apps in Apple App Store. It covers a wide range of topics including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, literature, business, writing and social science. Gauth is free to use for basic features but charges are required for additional functions.\n\u00d8\nMaoxiang is an AI-driven app that creates virtual companions with customerised look, voice and personality. The digital friends created are able to connect with the user at any time, providing comforting and reassuring companionship and support as needed. Maoxiang has been gaining popularity, securing a top five spot on the virtual companion app download list in China within a couple of months of its launch earlier in the year. It is free to use for basic features but paid subscriptions are required for additional functions.\n\u00d8\nJimeng AI, a Sora-style text-to-video generator, was one of the latest AI products of the ByteDance group. It became available on the Apple App Store for Chinese users in early August 2024, shortly following its debut in China on Android phones on 31 July 2024. Jimeng AI offers subscription plans starting at RMB69 per month up to of RMB659 per year, with a monthly generating limit of around 2,050 images or 168 videos.\n\u00d8\nCapCut is a highly popular video editing app released in 2020 and has amassed more than 1.4 billion global downloads by September 2024 according to Statista with monthly active users of over 300 million and a commanding market share of 81% as reported by Sensor Tower. Since its release, it has been updated with a myriad of AI features that includes, among others, video generation, video upscaling, noise reduction and flicker removal, video trimmer, video resizer, background removal and generation, script writing, auto-captioning and video translation. CapCut has been widely adopted by Douyin, TikTok and Instagram users.\n\u00d8\nVolcano Engine has struck a strategic partnership with Mercedes-Benz to integrate its LLM technology into Mercedes-Benz's in-car systems in China. The partnership aims to improve the functionalities of the voice and navigation systems of Mercedes-Benz through the use of AI. In addition, ByteDance has formed an automobile LLM ecosystem alliance with more than 20 local car manufacturers, including key players such as Geely and Great Wall Motor, thereby expanding its influence in the automotive industry.\nOther recent business highlights of the ByteDance group are set out below:\n\u00b7\nNuverse, the ByteDance group's gaming division best known for publishing Marvel Snap, has undergone a major restructuring involving job cuts and layoffs as well as divestment of game studios. Following the streamlining, it has entered a new stage with an objective at the operational level of prioritising the development of in-house games and reducing the dependence on third-party game developers. Nuverse also intends to strengthen its management and reporting structure and reorient its strategic direction with a focus on long-term growth.\n\u00b7\nByteDance has proposed to the Malaysian Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry to invest US$2.1 billion to establish an AI hub with an additional US$354 million to expand its data centre facilities in Malaysia. This reflects the strategy and commitment of ByteDance to enhance the ByteDance group's regional presence and technological capabilities.\n\u00b7\nDongchedi, the automotive information and trading platform of the ByteDance group with a monthly active user base of 35.7 million in June 2024 according to mobile business intelligence service provider QuestMobile, is reportedly planning to raise up to U$$600 million at a pre-money valuation of close to $3 billion. Key investors are believed to include General Atlantic, HongShan (formerly Sequoia Capital China), KKR and Gaorong Ventures. In January 2024, Dongchedi was restructured into a wholly-owned subsidiary of ByteDance, which was widely regarded as a strategic move in anticipation of an initial public offering or other fundraising exercise.\n\u00b7\nByteDance is reportedly in the process of arranging a US$9.5 billion loan, which would be the largest dollar-denominated corporate facility in Asia outside of Japan. Coordinated by leading American banks, the loan financing would have a three-year tenor that could be extended to a maturity of up to five years. The funds raised would be used to refinance an existing $5 billion dual-tranche facility and to provide additional working capital.\nDingdong\n(Cayman) Limited (\"Dingdong\")\nSubsequent to the listing of Dingdong on the New York Stock Exchange, the Group directly holds its investment in the American depositary shares of Dingdong (\nthe\n\"\nDingdong ADS\").\nDingdong is the holding company of an e-commerce group that operates a mobile app, Dingdong Fresh, providing users with fresh produce, prepared food and other food products supported by a self-operated frontline fulfillment grid with some 45 regional processing centres and about 1,000 frontline fulfillment stations on leased properties. The operations of the Dingdong group cover 25 cities across China with a significant portion of revenue derived from the Yangtze River Delta Megalopolis.\nBased on recent financial information and guidance provided by Dingdong, the Dingdong group appears to have reached the escape velocity from loss-making, having been able to deliver and with the expectation to continue to achieve what seems to be sustainable profitability on a consecutive and consistent basis.\nAs revealed by the unaudited quarterly reports of the first and second quarters of 2024 filed by Dingong with the regulatory authority (the \"First Quarterly Report\" and the \"Second Quarterly Report\"), the Dingdong group had resumed revenue growth since the beginning of year, following the sales decline in 2023 due to the strategic withdrawal of operations from certain cities where attaining profitability in the short term would be uncertain and the high base effect caused by the surge in online grocery demand under the restrictive measures implemented during the resurgence of the COVID pandemic in 2022. In the first and second quarters of 2024, revenue grew year-on-year by 0.5% and 15.7% to US$5.0 billion and US$5.6 billion respectively. The revenue growth resumption was primarily attributed to the increase in the number of transacting users, the increase in the frequency of purchases as well as network expansion in East China. Gross profit margin was largely maintained at around the 30% level. Consequent of the improved operational efficiency arising from the increase in order volume and the optimisation of the layout of the regional processing centres, fulfillment expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from over 23.5%2 in 2023 to 22.4% by the second quarter of 2024. This had a particularly beneficial impact on the thin-margin operations of the Dingdong group. Non-GAAP net income3 jumped significantly on a year-on-year basis, registering seventh consecutive quarterly profitability to reach RMB45.1 million and RMB103.1 million for the first and second quarters of 2024 respectively. At the same time, net income also hit a record high of RMB67.1 million for the three months ended 30 June 2024.\n2\nbased on the audited results of operations for the year ended 31 December 2023 contained in the 2023 annual report of Dingdong\n3\non the basis of the non-GAAP measure widely considered to be a useful indicator of the underlying business trend by excluding the non-cash charges of share-based compensation\nLikewise, cash flow performance was equally favourable. Net cash provided by operating activities registered four consecutive quarterly gains, amounting to RMB94.8 million and RMB245.7 million for the first and second quarters of 2024 respectively. This had further strengthened the financial position of the Dingdong group, raising net cash balance, calculated by deducting short-term borrowings from the sum of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, to RMB2.3 billion by 30 June 2024.\nWhile the online grocery industry remains crowded and fiercely competitive in China, the Dingdong group, having effectuated strategic operational adjustments and having established strong supply chain capabilities, is in an advantageous position to compete and pursue sustainable growth in revenue and profit. According to the\nguidance set out in the First Quarterly Report and the Second Quarterly Report,\nthe Dingdong group is confident of achieving non-GAAP and GAAP profitability for the remaining quarters as well as the entire year of 2024.\nSeyond Holdings Ltd. (\"Seyond\", formerly Innovusion Holdings Ltd.) through the Hermitage Fund Twelve SP (the \"Hermitage Fund Twelve\")\nThe Group holds an investment in\nthe Class A Participating Shares of the Hermitage Galaxy Fund SPC attributable to the Hermitage Fund Twelve, the sole underlying investment asset of which is an equity interest in Seyond.\nFounded and headquartered in Silicon Valley in California in the United States, Seyond is an unlisted holding company of a technology group that specialises in the development of image grade light detection and ranging (\"LiDAR\") sensor systems for notably the autonomous vehicle and advance driver-assistance system markets with strategically placed research and manufacturing facilities across the globe. The product portfolio of the Seyond group includes ultra-long-range front view LiDAR sensors, the Falcon series which is based on the 1550nm wavelength technology, and long-range front view / mid-range wide view LiDAR sensors, the Robin\nseries which utilises the 905nm wavelength technology, as well as the perception service software platform, OmniVidi.\nDuring the first half of 2024, the Seyond group continued to ramp up the delivery of LiDAR units, which had risen significantly from the initial low base since mass production of Falcon K1 commenced some two years ago. The majority of the shipments were delivered to Nio, a shareholder of Seyond, and were installed as standard configuration in most of Nio's passenger vehicle models including ET5(T), ET7, ES6, ES7/EL7 and ES8. On the back of the significantly risen deliveries, and notwithstanding the declining prices of LiDAR sensors in line with board industry trend, revenue had naturally risen in tandem, albeit at a slower pace on a relative basis yet at a seriously fast rate in absolute terms. Thanks to economies of scale, product design improvements and upgrades and the decline in the costs of parts and components, gross profit margin had also made substantial moves in the positive direction. Indeed, the Seyond group appears to have found the path to eventual profitability.\nAt the 18th Beijing International Auto Show 2024, Seyond unveiled two new products, Falcon K3, the third-generation of the ultra-long-range front view LiDAR sensors of the Falcon series, and Robin D, a newly launched mid-range ultra-wide view LiDAR\nsensors of the Robin series.\nBased on the 1550nm wavelength technology, the Falcon series has been central to the development of the Seyond Group and has within a few years undergone three generations of evolution. Falcon K1 was the first mass produced LiDAR sensors delivered to Nio for installation in ET7s. Falcon K2 has been enhanced by the incorporation of an embedded self-developed\napplication-specific integrated circuit\n(\"ASIC\") chip that reduces power consumption from 30 watts to 20 watts. The newly developed Falcon K3 boasts an enhanced detection range at 10% reflectivity of up to 300 metres with a maximum angular resolution of 0.12\u00b0 (horizontal) and 0.03\u00b0 (vertical) that further boosts perception capabilities and hence improves driving safety.\nFalcon K2 is expected to completely replace Falcon K1 in the near term. The use of self-developed ASIC chips in Falcon K2 production reflects the efforts of the Seyond group to localise the supply chain to minimise foreign supply risk with the added benefit of reducing production cost on top of product performance enhancement.\nThe Robin series, which utilises the 905nm wavelength technology, achieves a harmonious equilibrium between product performance and production cost. It has a light-weight and compact design with low power consumption of 9 watts for ease of integration. The Robin series includes Robin E, the long-range front view LiDAR sensors, and Robin W, the mid-range wide view LiDAR sensors, both of which are used in passenger vehicles, robotaxis and unmanned logistics. The recently launched Robin D boasts an ultra-wide view of up to 270\u00b0 (horizontal) and 90\u00b0 (vertical) to achieve an exceedingly broad field of view coverage in a cost-efficient manner.\nThe new smart electric executive flagship model of Nio, ET9, to be launched in early 2025, will be equipped with a Falcon K on the roof and two Robin Ws on each side of the fenders. The combination LiDAR solution, comprising an ultra-long-range front view sensor and two mid-range wide view sensors, will achieve a 360\u00b0 perceptual coverage without blind areas, offering a most effective protection and support for high-level autonomous driving.\nOther recent business highlights of the Seyond group are set out below:\n\u00b7\nSeyond has teamed up with NVIDIA to incorporate the LiDAR technology of the Seyond group into the NVIDIA DriveWorks and Omniverse platforms, with the ambition of transforming the design, development and testing of autonomous vehicles. The collaboration leverages the extensive autonomous vehicle software development experience of NVIDIA and uses the LiDAR sensors of the Seyond group alongside with NVIDIA's graphics processing unithardware to efficiently interpret point cloud data, thereby improving autonomous driving\ncapabilities. Furthermore, through the NVIDIA DriveWorks platform and its automotive-grade middleware and accelerated algorithms, the LiDAR technology of the Seyond group can be readily integrated into the vehicle designs of various automotive manufacturers.\n\u00b7\nSeyond and Peachtree Corners are collaborating to work together on improving the road safety and traffic management in the advanced infrastructure of Peachtree Corners, the pioneering 5G smart city and innovation hub located in the metro-Atlanta area in the U.S. The collaboration provides the opportunity for the Seyond group to acquire valuable real-world data that will enhance and optimise its LiDAR technology for wider use in intelligent urban settings. Under the deal, OmniVidi, the perception service software platform of the Seyond group, and Integrator AI, the edge compute system on traffic management of Blue-Band, have been deployed at a select intersection in Peachtree Corners to generate real-time 3D mapping with vehicle and pedestrian object detection. The data collected provides Peachtree Corners insightful information to adjust and implement traffic signals and intersection design to address specific safety and efficiency needs.\nAccording to Yole Intelligence, a major consulting firm specialising in the semiconductor and adjacent industries, the global LiDAR market for passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and robotaxis was estimated at US$538 million in 2023, representing a year-on-year growth of 79%. Seyond had a market share of 19%, ranking third behind Hesai and Robosense. The global LiDAR market is projected to grow at an annual compound growth rate of 38% to reach US$2.9 billion by 2029. Since the late 2010s, the adoption of LiDAR technology had increased significantly, with a greater number of vehicles equipped with LiDAR sensors being released in 2023 than in the entire period from 2018 to 2022. In 2024 or shortly after, around 128 car models with LiDAR sensors are expected to be launched in China, substantially surpassing the 10 European and the two U.S. LiDAR-equipped models that are in the pipeline. Notwithstanding the recent escalation in import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles imposed by the E.U., the U.S. and Canada, the Seyond group remains well-placed to capture the rapid growth in the LiDAR space.\nGiven the depressed valuations of a plenitude of U.S.-listed China-based companies despite repeated all-time highs in Wall Street, and taking into account the geopolitical factors, Seyond is considering the option of a listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Any plan to list, however, would be subject to investment market conditions.\nOasis Education Group Limited (\"Oasis Group\")\nOasis Group is a 50% joint venture of the Group. The operating subsidiary of Oasis Group, Oasis Education Consulting (Shenzhen) Company Limited (\"Oasis Shenzhen\",\n\u5967\u5049\u8a69\u6559\u80b2\u8aee\u8a62\n(\n\u6df1\u5733\n)\n\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\n),\nprovides\nconsulting and support services\nto the Huizhou\nKindergarten in the Guangdong Province in China\n.\nFollowing the graduation of 81 pupils in the summer of 2024, the Huizhou Kindergarten enrolled 35 new pupils for the academic term that commenced in September 2024\nand its total pupil enrolment stands at 183.\nHaving operated for ten years with a steady track record,\nthe Huizhou\nKindergarten celebrated its 10th anniversary in July 2024.\nPROSPECTS\nGlobal GDP is projected to grow by 3.2% in 2024 and 3.3% in 2025 by the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook Update published in July 2024. The report highlights that there were positive and negative growth surprises during the first quarter of 2024. Among the world's leading economies, both the U.S. and Japan experienced a sharper-than-expected slowdown while Europe and China managed to perform better. The forecast for 2025 shows a mixed scenario with the economic growth in the U.S. declining from 2.6% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025 and China from 5.0% to 4.5%. This compares with the accelerating growth projections for Germany from 0.2% to 1.3%, France from 0.9% to 1.3% and the U.K. from 0.7% and 1.5%. These figures suggest that, despite increasing trade restrictions, global trade is expected to remain fairly stable, at lease at the aggregate level, and is unlikely to have any weighty adverse impact on the economic growth across the globe.\nAccording to a speech presented by a senior official of the International Monetary Fund at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research in May 2024, however, the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have already given rise to signs of trade fragmentation, as reflected by the falling growth in trade between U.S.-aligned countries and China-aligned countries, although the economic impact of the decoupling has somewhat been cushioned by trade re-routing through third party links. Countries such as Mexico and Vietnam, with which China has a meaningful export relationship and in which China has a meaningful investment presence, have registered increased exports to the U.S. Although trade re-routing could benefit third party links between rival blocs and provide a temporary fix to contain and mitigate the decoupling impact, it would not be a permanent solution that could effectively deal with the trade fragmentation issue and preserve the gain from economic integration and globalisation. There are bound to be circumstances where trade re-routing activities would inevitably lead to additional restrictive measures on trade and there is also cost associated with trade re-routing that would be inflationary. In fact, further increase in trade restrictions and sanctions are likely to arise given the persistent concerns over national security, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle-East conflicts, resulting in increased trade fragmentation that would be redirected along geopolitical lines.\nOn the pollical front apart from geopolitics, 2024 is a history-making election year during which more than 60 countries are to hold presidential and/or legislative elections. Support for the far-right camps has evidently been gaining popularity and has spread across borders as reflected in the election outcomes in Europe, India, South Africa and the U.K. Many voters across various countries are unhappy with their governments and are looking for changes. The fall in living standards is among their main concerns. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, inflating prices in energy, food and other basic items have adversely affected the livelihood of many households worldwide. But notwithstanding the sticky inflation in the service sector, price pressure has in general been on a downward trend moving towards the target level in a sustainable path. In response, central banks in developed economies have pivoted and embarked on policy easing. Nonetheless, while the negative effect of high cost of living is subsiding, the far-right parties, leveraging on the mandate given by the voters, could take the opportunity to advance their nationalistic and deglobalisation agenda, demanding protective measures that would trigger further geopolitical and trade tensions.\nDuring the first half of 2024, activities in the private equity market were lower than the same period last year. Uncertain economic and political outlook continued to weigh on investment sentiments. However, there is an air of optimism in the second half of 2024 as the divergence of valuations between sellers and buyers shows a narrowing trend. According to PitchBook, of the global inventory of 27,000 private equity portfolio companies, nearly half of them have been on the books of the investors for some five years and they are under pressure to seek exit opportunities. In addition, there is an estimated US$2 trillion in private debt that requires refinancing by the end of 2024. Due to long-term outperformance with better investment returns compared to other asset classes and for diversification purposes, new capital continued to flow into the private market at, according to industry sources, an annual rate of about 8% for the past five years, bringing the total assets under management for the industry to US$13.3 trillion in 2023. But given the increasing preference of investors towards bigger firms that offer a broad range of investment services covering diversified multi-asset classes, major industry players have been getting the lion share of the funds raised. Under the circumstances with the challenges in fundraising, coupled with the burgeoning regulatory scrutiny and compliance cost on top of the lack of economies of scale, many smaller sized fund managers are unable to compete and have to turn to specialisation in certain niche segments in order to survive. There has also been a wave of consolidations in the private equity landscape, including a number of high-profile mergers and acquisitions involving industry heavyweights in 2023 and 2024.\nIn line with its growth target, China's GDP expanded year-on-year by 5% in the first half of 2024. Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that industrial output and foreign trade grew year-on-year by 6.0% and 6.1% respectively. The growth in exports of high-tech goods, mechanical and electrical items, cars and\u00a0ships outperformed the traditional low value-added products that China excelled in during the past decades. However, with the expected increase in trade restrictions, foreign trade is expected to slow down. This together with the sluggish domestic demand and the struggling property sector could have an adverse impact on the GDP growth rate for the full year in 2024. As the majority of the Group's underlying investments are largely China-focused, their near-term prospects do not appear to be particularly promising and they are unlikely to make any meaningful contributions to the Group's results in the near term. Nonetheless, the Board remains confident on the long-term potential of the Group's investment portfolio companies which are well placed to benefit from the continued growth of China's economy in the long term.\nBy order of the Board\nAlastair GUNN-FORBES\nNon-Executive Chairman\n24 September 2024\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe Group is exposed to a number of principal risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect its performance for the remaining six months of the year ending 31 December 2024 and beyond.
