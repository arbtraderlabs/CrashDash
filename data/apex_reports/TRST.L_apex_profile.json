As previously stated, the Company is committed to running an efficient balance sheet and returning excess capital, not required for other priorities, to shareholders.\nThe Trustpilot agreement with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (trading for these purposes as Deutsche Numis) (\"\nDeutsche Numis\"\n) to purchase Trustpilot's Ordinary Shares has been amended to reflect the increased maximum aggregate consideration (excluding expenses) of \u00a340 million under the Buyback Programme. Deutsche Numis will continue to manage the purchases on a non-discretionary basis, purchasing Ordinary Shares within certain pre-set parameters and making its trading decisions independently of, and uninfluenced by, Trustpilot.\nThe purchase of Ordinary Shares will continue to be carried out on the London Stock Exchange and other trading venues and in accordance with share purchase authorities granted to the Company by its shareholders at the 2025 Annual General Meeting. Deutsche Numis will purchase any Ordinary Shares as principal and simultaneously be deemed to execute on-market sales of any Ordinary Shares so purchased to the Company in accordance with the agreement.\nThe sole purpose of the Buyback Programme is to reduce the share capital of Trustpilot. It is intended that all Ordinary Shares purchased under the Buyback Programme will be cancelled.\nThe Buyback Programme will continue to be conducted within certain pre-set parameters and in accordance with the general authority to repurchase Ordinary Shares granted by Trustpilot's shareholders at the 2025 Annual General Meeting (the \"\nAuthority\n\"), and with the EU Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (in each case as such legislation forms part of Retained EU Law (as defined in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018)) as well as the applicable laws and regulations of the UK Financial Conduct Authority.\nThe maximum number of Ordinary Shares that Trustpilot may purchase under the Buyback Programme before expiry of the Authority, which occurs on the earlier of the conclusion of the 2026 AGM and 20 August 2026, remains 36,179,442, being the maximum number permitted under the Authority. The Buyback Programme shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of the purchase by Deutsche Numis of such maximum number of Ordinary Shares or of Ordinary Shares with a maximum aggregate consideration (excluding expenses) of \u00a340 million, or the expiry of the Authority.\nTrustpilot will announce any market repurchases of Ordinary Shares no later than 7.30 a.m. (UK time) on the business day following the date the repurchase occurred.\nThe Company is satisfied that it is not party to any inside information which has not previously been disclosed via Regulatory Information Service.\nFollowing cancellation of the shares purchased as part of the Buyback Programme during the week commencing 5 January 2026, the Company's total issued share capital consists of 394,078,359 Ordinary Shares, with one voting right per share. The Company holds 0 Ordinary Shares in treasury.\nTherefore, the total number of voting rights attributable to the Ordinary Shares is 394,078,359.\nEnquiries\nTrustpilot\nLouise Bryant, Head of Investor Relations\ninvestor.relations@trustpilot.com\n+44 (0) 7813 210 809\nFinancial PR\nHeadland Consultancy\nStephen Malthouse\nRob Walker\nCharlie Pepper\n+44 (0) 73 1136 9861\nAbout Trustpilot\nTrustpilot began in 2007 with a simple yet powerful idea that is more relevant today than ever - to be the universal symbol of trust, bringing consumers and businesses together through reviews.
