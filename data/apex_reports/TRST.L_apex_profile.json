As previously stated, the Company is committed to running an efficient balance sheet and returning excess capital, not required for other priorities, to shareholders.\nThe Trustpilot agreement with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (trading for these purposes as Deutsche Numis) (\"\nDeutsche Numis\"\n) to purchase Trustpilot's Ordinary Shares has been amended to reflect the increased maximum aggregate consideration (excluding expenses) of \u00a340 million under the Buyback Programme. Deutsche Numis will continue to manage the purchases on a non-discretionary basis, purchasing Ordinary Shares within certain pre-set parameters and making its trading decisions independently of, and uninfluenced by, Trustpilot.\nThe purchase of Ordinary Shares will continue to be carried out on the London Stock Exchange and other trading venues and in accordance with share purchase authorities granted to the Company by its shareholders at the 2025 Annual General Meeting. Deutsche Numis will purchase any Ordinary Shares as principal and simultaneously be deemed to execute on-market sales of any Ordinary Shares so purchased to the Company in accordance with the agreement.\nThe sole purpose of the Buyback Programme is to reduce the share capital of Trustpilot. It is intended that all Ordinary Shares purchased under the Buyback Programme will be cancelled.\nThe Buyback Programme will continue to be conducted within certain pre-set parameters and in accordance with the general authority to repurchase Ordinary Shares granted by Trustpilot's shareholders at the 2025 Annual General Meeting (the \"\nAuthority\n\"), and with the EU Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (in each case as such legislation forms part of Retained EU Law (as defined in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018)) as well as the applicable laws and regulations of the UK Financial Conduct Authority.\nThe maximum number of Ordinary Shares that Trustpilot may purchase under the Buyback Programme before expiry of the Authority, which occurs on the earlier of the conclusion of the 2026 AGM and 20 August 2026, remains 36,179,442, being the maximum number permitted under the Authority. The Buyback Programme shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of the purchase by Deutsche Numis of such maximum number of Ordinary Shares or of Ordinary Shares with a maximum aggregate consideration (excluding expenses) of \u00a340 million, or the expiry of the Authority.\nTrustpilot will announce any market repurchases of Ordinary Shares no later than 7.30 a.m. (UK time) on the business day following the date the repurchase occurred.\nThe Company is satisfied that it is not party to any inside information which has not previously been disclosed via Regulatory Information Service.\nFollowing cancellation of the shares purchased as part of the Buyback Programme during the week commencing 5 January 2026, the Company's total issued share capital consists of 394,078,359 Ordinary Shares, with one voting right per share. The Company holds 0 Ordinary Shares in treasury.\nTherefore, the total number of voting rights attributable to the Ordinary Shares is 394,078,359.\nEnquiries\nTrustpilot\nLouise Bryant, Head of Investor Relations\ninvestor.relations@trustpilot.com\n+44 (0) 7813 210 809\nFinancial PR\nHeadland Consultancy\nStephen Malthouse\nRob Walker\nCharlie Pepper\n+44 (0) 73 1136 9861\nAbout Trustpilot\nTrustpilot began in 2007 with a simple yet powerful idea that is more relevant today than ever - to be the universal symbol of trust, bringing consumers and businesses together through reviews.

The annual contract value of contracts signed in a given period translated at monthly average rates.\n2. Annual recurring revenue is defined as the annual value of subscription contracts measured on the final day of a reporting period.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u25cf We expect to report FY 25 bookings of $291m (FY 24: $239m), up 22% year on year and 18% at constant currency (cc):\n\u25cb UK bookings of $116m, up 16% cc (FY 24: $97m);\n\u25cb Europe & ROW bookings of $113m, up 20% cc (FY 24: $90m);\n\u25cb North America bookings of $62m, up 21% cc (FY 24: $52m);\n\u25cf Last Twelve Month (LTM) net dollar retention rate expected to be 102% (FY 24: 103%) driven by improved gross retention of 87% (FY 24: 86%), offset by the annualisation of the package migration in April 2024;\n\u25cf Adjusted EBITDA projected to be ahead of market expectations;\n\u25cf Strong cash generation, with cash at 31 December 2025 of $48m (FY 24: $69m) having completed $72m (\u00a354m) of share buybacks during the year;\n\u25cb Intend to extend the existing buyback programme by up to \u00a310m (c.$13m) given strong cash position and confidence in future cash generation\nOperational Update\n\u25cf Growth accelerated in H2 with particular strength in new business and Enterprise customers;\n\u25cf Importance of Trustpilot in AI answer engine optimisation helping drive growth;\n\u25cf Implemented new AI-enabled fraud detection technology as we continuously improve our enforcement and removed 7.8 million fake reviews.\nAdrian Blair, CEO of Trustpilot said:\n\"2025 was a year of excellent strategic and financial progress, with growth accelerating in H2. Answer Engine Optimisation drove particularly strong growth in enterprise new business. This, combined with product innovation and improved gross dollar retention, positions us strongly for 2026. We reinforced our core commitment to trust, implementing new AI-enabled fraud detection technology, ensuring that both consumers and the 1.3 million businesses using Trustpilot can continue to build trust with confidence.\"\nNote: On 8 January 2026 the FY25 company-compiled analyst mean consensus was for constant currency revenue growth of 18% and adj. EBITDA of $37m with a 14.6% adjusted EBITDA margin. 13 analysts contributed to consensus.\nItalian regulatory update\nWe recently received a draft \"Statement of Objections\" from the Italian competition authority (AGCM) in relation to an alleged breach of the Italian Consumer Code, and are submitting a robust response. We expect the process to conclude by the end of March 2026 and do not anticipate any outcome to have a material impact on the Group's operations. Italy represents less than 5% of Group revenue.\nSelection of auditor\nOn 15 July 2025 we announced that the Group was launching a competitive tender process for the role of its external auditor for the financial year ending 31 December 2026 and onwards. The decision to tender the external audit at this juncture was driven by the upcoming rotation of the audit partner and is in line with the company's commitment to strong corporate governance given the period of time that the current auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, had been acting as auditor within the Group, including before IPO.\nThe formal tender process, overseen by the Company's Audit & Risk Committee, has now concluded following a careful evaluation of the offering of each participant. It was the recommendation of the Committee, which has been endorsed by the Board, that a resolution be put to shareholders for approval at the 2026 Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\"), appointing Ernst & Young LLP as the Group's auditor for the year ending 31 December 2026.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will undertake the Group audit for the year ending 31 December 2025.\nNotice of results\nThe Group will report 2025 full year results on 17 March 2026. A hybrid analyst and investor meeting will be held on the day at 9.00am GMT at the London Stock Exchange or via\nhttps://sparklive.lseg.com/TRUSTPILOTGROUP/events/4e3ee369-ff77-4d3b-8824-6520fcdd1ebf/trustpilot-fy-2025-results\n.

          "full_content": "5 Dec 2025 16:30\nRNS Number : 5235K\nTrustpilot Group PLC\n05 December 2025\nTrustpilot rejects categorically false allegations by Grizzly Research\nThe Board of Trustpilot rejects categorically the allegations made in the report published by Grizzly Research. Their report contains factual inaccuracies and false claims, which were intended to adversely impact the company's share price. Trustpilot was not contacted for comment.\nThe report is built on a basic misunderstanding of Trustpilot's business model. It ignores publicly available information about our scale, policies, data, and enforcement, and makes a series of demonstrably false accusations, including:\n\u25cf It is false to claim that Trustpilot creates unsolicited review profiles to sell subscriptions. Over 97% of businesses on the platform do not pay for a subscription. Consumers and businesses create profiles for free. 70% of reviews on free profiles are 5 stars.\n\u25cf It is false to claim that fake reviews are managed differently for paying vs free businesses. All businesses - whether free or paid - must comply with the same\nGuidelines\nand are held to the same moderation principles.\n\u25cf It is false to claim that we have traded the integrity of reviews for revenue. We have c.200 people focused on ensuring trust and integrity across our platform and have removed 6.7m reviews from the platform so far this year. We have successfully brought lawsuits against bad actor businesses and review sellers.\nWe are considering all appropriate options in response to demonstrably false statements. Below we set out the facts about our business model and content moderation.\nTrustpilot exists to help consumers make the right choice and businesses to build trust, grow and improve\nTrustpilot operates a freemium business model where businesses have the choice whether to use Trustpilot for free or to subscribe. Businesses which subscribe are buying access to brand rights and tools that automate review collection and provide insights into customer feedback. There are 1.3 million businesses that have claimed their profile on the platform of which 3.1% pay for additional features. These features and our pricing plans can be found\nhere\n.\nThe platform is global, open and hosts over 350 million reviews. This means consumers have the freedom to share their genuine experiences as and when they choose, and businesses can invite consumers to leave feedback, and respond at any time. Information about how Trustpilot works is in the\npublic domain\n, and was not referred to in their report.\nAny business has the right to claim its own Trustpilot profile for free. This enables them to receive and reply to all reviews. We transparently disclose data on all businesses reviews and whether they are a paying customer through the \"How this company uses Trustpilot\" link on every profile page.Trustpilot does not create unsolicited review profiles in order to sell subscriptions. Profiles are created by consumers when they search for or want to share feedback about a business, or can be created by businesses who want to collect feedback.\nOur guidelines and fraud detection technologies apply equally to paying and non paying businesses. The TrustScore calculation is identical for all customers. It is active engagement by businesses inviting and responding to reviews, rather than whether they are a paying customer, which impacts the TrustScore. The average TrustScore for a paying customer is 4.37 and for a free business that is actively engaging with the platform is 4.26.\nTrustpilot is vigilant about moderation and is constantly developing new detection models\nTrustpilot recognises that all review platforms operating at our scale attract bad actors. We take content moderation extremely seriously and are constantly evolving our processes to address bad actors. We have a team of c.200 people focused on ensuring trust and integrity across our platform. Their report suggests that we have at most 6 people, which is clearly inaccurate. Over the last 2 years, we've increased our investment in this process by almost 50%, putting millions of dollars into our people and technology, and we will continue to do so.\nOur commercial team is entirely separate from our Trust function and is not able to influence the outcome of content moderation. All teams at Trustpilot, including our commercial team, undertake regular training around the importance of acting with integrity, and in accordance with our\nTrust principles.\nAll businesses - whether free or paid - must comply with the same\nGuidelines\n. The same moderation standards apply and responding to and reporting reviews is free for all businesses.\nOur\nGuidelines for Reviewers\nare explicit: users are welcome to use profile pictures but they are expressly prohibited from\nimpersonating somebody else. We provide the option for reviewers to securely\nverify their ID\nto help build trust and credibility with our community.\nWe have a whistleblower form available to all users to report viol",

This is why reviews can be written at any time, about genuine experiences, and not just for purchases. We work hard to ensure the integrity of our reviews and take a responsible approach to technology.  We continuously invest in our platform\u2019s privacy and security, and innovate to protect our users. In addition to our fraud detection systems, all reviews are screened by our automated technology to identify and remove any violations. We also allow consumers and businesses to flag reviews they think are suspicious. I think they won\u2019t agree with Grizzley Bear Shorts beware",

The company\u2019s pivot to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation is now further validated by the failure of the recent short attack by Grizzly Research. With Grizzly reportedly closing its short position just days after the initial drop, the market has effectively rejected the \"bear thesis,\" clearing a significant overhang on the stock. This rapid capitulation by the short seller\u2014combined with immediate insider buying from the CEO and Chair\u2014signals extreme management confidence and suggests the dip was a liquidity event rather than a fundamental break, offering an attractive entry point into a market leader with massive US growth potential.",

Why this matters \u200bThis is a significant \"Institutional Vote of Confidence\" that parallels the \"Insider Vote of Confidence\" (Director buying) I mentioned earlier. \u200bSmart Money is Buying: While retail investors may have been panic-selling on the Grizzly Research news, one of the world's largest asset managers was actively accumulating more shares during the volatility. \u200bConfirmation: This confirms that the \"dip\" was viewed by major institutions as a buying opportunity, not a reason to exit.",

The company\u2019s pivot to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation is now further validated by the failure of the recent short attack by Grizzly Research. With Grizzly reportedly closing its short position just days after the initial drop, the market has effectively rejected the \"bear thesis,\" clearing a significant overhang on the stock. This rapid capitulation by the short seller\u2014combined with immediate insider buying from the CEO and Chair\u2014signals extreme management confidence and suggests the dip was a liquidity event rather than a fundamental break, offering an attractive entry point into a market leader with massive US growth potential.",

The company\u2019s pivot to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation is now further validated by the failure of the recent short attack by Grizzly Research. With Grizzly reportedly closing its short position just days after the initial drop, the market has effectively rejected the \"bear thesis,\" clearing a significant overhang on the stock. This rapid capitulation by the short seller\u2014combined with immediate insider buying from the CEO and Chair\u2014signals extreme management confidence and suggests the dip was a liquidity event rather than a fundamental break, offering an attractive entry point into a market leader with massive US growth potential.",

This is why reviews can be written at any time, about genuine experiences, and not just for purchases. We work hard to ensure the integrity of our reviews and take a responsible approach to technology.  We continuously invest in our platform\u2019s privacy and security, and innovate to protect our users. In addition to our fraud detection systems, all reviews are screened by our automated technology to identify and remove any violations. We also allow consumers and businesses to flag reviews they think are suspicious. I think they won\u2019t agree with Grizzley Bear Shorts beware",

This rapid capitulation by the short seller\u2014combined with immediate insider buying from the CEO and Chair\u2014signals extreme management confidence and suggests the dip was a liquidity event rather than a fundamental break, offering an attractive entry point into a market leader with massive US growth potential.",

This is why reviews can be written at any time, about genuine experiences, and not just for purchases. We work hard to ensure the integrity of our reviews and take a responsible approach to technology.  We continuously invest in our platform\u2019s privacy and security, and innovate to protect our users. In addition to our fraud detection systems, all reviews are screened by our automated technology to identify and remove any violations. We also allow consumers and businesses to flag reviews they think are suspicious. I think they won\u2019t agree with Grizzley Bear Shorts beware",

          "content": "Trustpilot should not be getting hit. AI is a benefit From Gemini The Disintermediation Trap (The Victims) \u200bThe reason Relx (-14%), London Stock Exchange (-13%), and Sage (-10%) crashed is that their primary value is processing and organizing information\u2014tasks that \"Claude Cowork\" agents are purpose-built to do. \u200bThe Threat: If a Claude agent can draft a legal brief, check compliance, or reconcile accounts directly within a company\u2019s own database, the expensive subscription to a third-party software platform becomes redundant. \u200bThe Result: Revenue per seat collapses because the \"software\" is replaced by the \"agent.\" \u200b2. Why Trustpilot is \"Agent-Proof\" \u200bTrustpilot is not a \"workflow\" tool; it is a Proprietary Data Moat. Anthropic's agents can do the work, but they cannot manufacture human experience or reputation. \u200bHuman Authenticity as the Product: Claude Cowork can automate a legal briefing, but it cannot \"automate\" 300 million humans giving their opinions. In a world where AI-generated content is everywhere, verified human intent becomes the rarest and most valuable commodity. \u200bThe \"Source of Truth\" for Agents: When a Claude agent is tasked with \"buying the most reliable fleet of vans for a business,\" it doesn't just guess. It has to pull data from a trusted source. Trustpilot is becoming the \"Truth Layer\" that these AI agents rely on to make decisions. \u200bData Scarcity: Relx and LSE deal with public or semi-public records (laws, stock prices) that AI can easily ingest. Trustpilot deals with closed-loop human feedback that it owns and protects. \u200b3. The \"Contagion\" Mispricing \u200bThe drop in Trustpilot\u2019s share price is likely a result of sector-level selling rather than a flaw in its business model: \u200bPassive Outflows: Many investors hold \"Global Software\" or \"FTSE 250 Tech\" ETFs. When they sell those funds due to the Anthropic news, Trustpilot gets sold automatically. \u200bThe \"Lump of AI\" Fallacy: Markets often treat all AI developments as a \"winner-take-all\" for the big AI labs (Anthropic, OpenAI). They forget that these models are \"data-hungry\" and will eventually have to pay for (or partner with) high-quality data providers like Trustpilot. \u200bBofA\u2019s Counter-Narrative \u200bThis is exactly why BofA raised their target to 272p right as this fear was peaking. Their report essentially says: \u200b\"Don't fear the agent; the agent is Trustpilot's new best customer.\" \u200bThey view Trustpilot as a beneficiary of the \"SaaSpocalypse\" because as businesses lose their ability to rank on traditional Google search (which is being replaced by AI answers), they will become even more desperate for the \"Trustpilot Star\" to appear in the AI's final recommendation.",

Unlike closed or pay-to-access review platforms, where reviews can only be left by invitation after a purchase, we believe in giving consumers the full picture and providing businesses with the real insights they need. This is why reviews can be written at any time, about genuine experiences, and not just for purchases. We work hard to ensure the integrity of our reviews and take a responsible approach to technology.  We continuously invest in our platform\u2019s privacy and security, and innovate to protect our users. In addition to our fraud detection systems, all reviews are screened by our automated technology to identify and remove any violations. We also allow consumers and businesses to flag reviews they think are suspicious. I think they won\u2019t agree with Grizzley Bear Shorts beware",

Why Trustpilot is \"Agent-Proof\" \u200bTrustpilot is not a \"workflow\" tool; it is a Proprietary Data Moat. Anthropic's agents can do the work, but they cannot manufacture human experience or reputation. \u200bHuman Authenticity as the Product: Claude Cowork can automate a legal briefing, but it cannot \"automate\" 300 million humans giving their opinions. In a world where AI-generated content is everywhere, verified human intent becomes the rarest and most valuable commodity. \u200bThe \"Source of Truth\" for Agents: When a Claude agent is tasked with \"buying the most reliable fleet of vans for a business,\" it doesn't just guess. It has to pull data from a trusted source. Trustpilot is becoming the \"Truth Layer\" that these AI agents rely on to make decisions. \u200bData Scarcity: Relx and LSE deal with public or semi-public records (laws, stock prices) that AI can easily ingest. Trustpilot deals with closed-loop human feedback that it owns and protects. \u200b3. The \"Contagion\" Mispricing \u200bThe drop in Trustpilot\u2019s share price is likely a result of sector-level selling rather than a flaw in its business model: \u200bPassive Outflows: Many investors hold \"Global Software\" or \"FTSE 250 Tech\" ETFs. When they sell those funds due to the Anthropic news, Trustpilot gets sold automatically. \u200bThe \"Lump of AI\" Fallacy: Markets often treat all AI developments as a \"winner-take-all\" for the big AI labs (Anthropic, OpenAI). They forget that these models are \"data-hungry\" and will eventually have to pay for (or partner with) high-quality data providers like Trustpilot. \u200bBofA\u2019s Counter-Narrative \u200bThis is exactly why BofA raised their target to 272p right as this fear was peaking. Their report essentially says: \u200b\"Don't fear the agent; the agent is Trustpilot's new best customer.\" \u200bThey view Trustpilot as a beneficiary of the \"SaaSpocalypse\" because as businesses lose their ability to rank on traditional Google search (which is being replaced by AI answers), they will become even more desperate for the \"Trustpilot Star\" to appear in the AI's final recommendation.",

The company\u2019s pivot to sustainable profitability and free cash flow generation is now further validated by the failure of the recent short attack by Grizzly Research. With Grizzly reportedly closing its short position just days after the initial drop, the market has effectively rejected the \"bear thesis,\" clearing a significant overhang on the stock. This rapid capitulation by the short seller\u2014combined with immediate insider buying from the CEO and Chair\u2014signals extreme management confidence and suggests the dip was a liquidity event rather than a fundamental break, offering an attractive entry point into a market leader with massive US growth potential.",

Unlike closed or pay-to-access review platforms, where reviews can only be left by invitation after a purchase, we believe in giving consumers the full picture and providing businesses with the real insights they need. This is why reviews can be written at any time, about genuine experiences, and not just for purchases. We work hard to ensure the integrity of our reviews and take a responsible approach to technology.  We continuously invest in our platform\u2019s privacy and security, and innovate to protect our users. In addition to our fraud detection systems, all reviews are screened by our automated technology to identify and remove any violations. We also allow consumers and businesses to flag reviews they think are suspicious. I think they won\u2019t agree with Grizzley Bear Shorts beware",

          "content": "Trustpilot should not be getting hit. AI is a benefit From Gemini The Disintermediation Trap (The Victims) \u200bThe reason Relx (-14%), London Stock Exchange (-13%), and Sage (-10%) crashed is that their primary value is processing and organizing information\u2014tasks that \"Claude Cowork\" agents are purpose-built to do. \u200bThe Threat: If a Claude agent can draft a legal brief, check compliance, or reconcile accounts directly within a company\u2019s own database, the expensive subscription to a third-party software platform becomes redundant. \u200bThe Result: Revenue per seat collapses because the \"software\" is replaced by the \"agent.\" \u200b2. Why Trustpilot is \"Agent-Proof\" \u200bTrustpilot is not a \"workflow\" tool; it is a Proprietary Data Moat. Anthropic's agents can do the work, but they cannot manufacture human experience or reputation. \u200bHuman Authenticity as the Product: Claude Cowork can automate a legal briefing, but it cannot \"automate\" 300 million humans giving their opinions. In a world where AI-generated content is everywhere, verified human intent becomes the rarest and most valuable commodity. \u200bThe \"Source of Truth\" for Agents: When a Claude agent is tasked with \"buying the most reliable fleet of vans for a business,\" it doesn't just guess. It has to pull data from a trusted source. Trustpilot is becoming the \"Truth Layer\" that these AI agents rely on to make decisions. \u200bData Scarcity: Relx and LSE deal with public or semi-public records (laws, stock prices) that AI can easily ingest. Trustpilot deals with closed-loop human feedback that it owns and protects. \u200b3. The \"Contagion\" Mispricing \u200bThe drop in Trustpilot\u2019s share price is likely a result of sector-level selling rather than a flaw in its business model: \u200bPassive Outflows: Many investors hold \"Global Software\" or \"FTSE 250 Tech\" ETFs. When they sell those funds due to the Anthropic news, Trustpilot gets sold automatically. \u200bThe \"Lump of AI\" Fallacy: Markets often treat all AI developments as a \"winner-take-all\" for the big AI labs (Anthropic, OpenAI). They forget that these models are \"data-hungry\" and will eventually have to pay for (or partner with) high-quality data providers like Trustpilot. \u200bBofA\u2019s Counter-Narrative \u200bThis is exactly why BofA raised their target to 272p right as this fear was peaking. Their report essentially says: \u200b\"Don't fear the agent; the agent is Trustpilot's new best customer.\" \u200bThey view Trustpilot as a beneficiary of the \"SaaSpocalypse\" because as businesses lose their ability to rank on traditional Google search (which is being replaced by AI answers), they will become even more desperate for the \"Trustpilot Star\" to appear in the AI's final recommendation.",

This rapid capitulation by the short seller\u2014combined with immediate insider buying from the CEO and Chair\u2014signals extreme management confidence and suggests the dip was a liquidity event rather than a fundamental break, offering an attractive entry point into a market leader with massive US growth potential.",

This is why reviews can be written at any time, about genuine experiences, and not just for purchases. We work hard to ensure the integrity of our reviews and take a responsible approach to technology.  We continuously invest in our platform\u2019s privacy and security, and innovate to protect our users. In addition to our fraud detection systems, all reviews are screened by our automated technology to identify and remove any violations. We also allow consumers and businesses to flag reviews they think are suspicious. I think they won\u2019t agree with Grizzley Bear Shorts beware",

          "content": "Trustpilot should not be getting hit. AI is a benefit From Gemini The Disintermediation Trap (The Victims) \u200bThe reason Relx (-14%), London Stock Exchange (-13%), and Sage (-10%) crashed is that their primary value is processing and organizing information\u2014tasks that \"Claude Cowork\" agents are purpose-built to do. \u200bThe Threat: If a Claude agent can draft a legal brief, check compliance, or reconcile accounts directly within a company\u2019s own database, the expensive subscription to a third-party software platform becomes redundant. \u200bThe Result: Revenue per seat collapses because the \"software\" is replaced by the \"agent.\" \u200b2. Why Trustpilot is \"Agent-Proof\" \u200bTrustpilot is not a \"workflow\" tool; it is a Proprietary Data Moat. Anthropic's agents can do the work, but they cannot manufacture human experience or reputation. \u200bHuman Authenticity as the Product: Claude Cowork can automate a legal briefing, but it cannot \"automate\" 300 million humans giving their opinions. In a world where AI-generated content is everywhere, verified human intent becomes the rarest and most valuable commodity. \u200bThe \"Source of Truth\" for Agents: When a Claude agent is tasked with \"buying the most reliable fleet of vans for a business,\" it doesn't just guess. It has to pull data from a trusted source. Trustpilot is becoming the \"Truth Layer\" that these AI agents rely on to make decisions. \u200bData Scarcity: Relx and LSE deal with public or semi-public records (laws, stock prices) that AI can easily ingest. Trustpilot deals with closed-loop human feedback that it owns and protects. \u200b3. The \"Contagion\" Mispricing \u200bThe drop in Trustpilot\u2019s share price is likely a result of sector-level selling rather than a flaw in its business model: \u200bPassive Outflows: Many investors hold \"Global Software\" or \"FTSE 250 Tech\" ETFs. When they sell those funds due to the Anthropic news, Trustpilot gets sold automatically. \u200bThe \"Lump of AI\" Fallacy: Markets often treat all AI developments as a \"winner-take-all\" for the big AI labs (Anthropic, OpenAI). They forget that these models are \"data-hungry\" and will eventually have to pay for (or partner with) high-quality data providers like Trustpilot. \u200bBofA\u2019s Counter-Narrative \u200bThis is exactly why BofA raised their target to 272p right as this fear was peaking. Their report essentially says: \u200b\"Don't fear the agent; the agent is Trustpilot's new best customer.\" \u200bThey view Trustpilot as a beneficiary of the \"SaaSpocalypse\" because as businesses lose their ability to rank on traditional Google search (which is being replaced by AI answers), they will become even more desperate for the \"Trustpilot Star\" to appear in the AI's final recommendation.",

This rapid capitulation by the short seller\u2014combined with immediate insider buying from the CEO and Chair\u2014signals extreme management confidence and suggests the dip was a liquidity event rather than a fundamental break, offering an attractive entry point into a market leader with massive US growth potential.",

This is why reviews can be written at any time, about genuine experiences, and not just for purchases. We work hard to ensure the integrity of our reviews and take a responsible approach to technology.  We continuously invest in our platform\u2019s privacy and security, and innovate to protect our users. In addition to our fraud detection systems, all reviews are screened by our automated technology to identify and remove any violations. We also allow consumers and businesses to flag reviews they think are suspicious. I think they won\u2019t agree with Grizzley Bear Shorts beware",
