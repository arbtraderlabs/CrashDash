          "full_content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 2478O\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n09 January 2026\n9 January 2026\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n(\"BMV or the \"Company\")\nStrategic Update\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd (\"BMV\" or the \"Company\"), the gold streaming and treasury company, provides a further update following its Operational Update announcement of 10 December 2025 and the Capital Reorganisation announcement dated 18 December 2025.\nMarket backdrop and inbound interest\nSince the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats.\nThe Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.\nTechnology partnership with BE\nBMV is pleased to confirm a strategic technology partnership with The BE Company (\"BE\"), an affiliated entity in which the Company's Chief Executive Officer has an interest, pursuant to which BE will act as BMV's recognised technology partner. BE is a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada.\nUnder this arrangement, BE will provide in-kind advisory and development support across:\n\u00b7\nIT security and data management\n\u00b7\nDigital and data-centre infrastructure\n\u00b7\nHosting services and software licensing\n\u00b7\nHigh-performance computing and GPU-based platforms\nThe scope also includes support for research and development activities focused on advanced data-driven analysis and high-performance computing applications for geological and subsurface interpretation. The relationship is expected to support business development initiatives during 2026, with the potential for selective commercialisation later in the year. All intellectual property generated under this arrangement will remain the property of BE. BMV will be granted a non-exclusive licence to deploy such technology within its own operations and client services.\nThe Board emphasises that these technology initiatives are supportive and exploratory, with the Company's primary focus remaining its gold streaming and treasury strategy.\nUpdate on equity arrangements\nFurther to the Company's announcement of 18 December 2025, the Board confirms that the previously announced Management and External Investor Equity Subscription Facility and related incentive proposals will not proceed and are being replaced by a revised equity-based arrangement involving Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an entity owned and controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah. The Company has entered into a share incentive trust arrangement pursuant to which Skylake has agreed to subscribe for 650,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company for an aggregate consideration of \u00a33.25 million on a fully paid basis, with \u00a36,250 payable on issue and the balance payable subject to finalisation of a formal incentive scheme over the next few months. The trust is for the benefit of the Company and includes provision for the return of the shares if the milestones for incentive awards cannot be agreed. Furthermore, Skylake has agreed not to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares whilst they are held on trust for the Company. The share incentive trust arrangement is intended to support the provision of seconded services to the Company in lieu of cash remuneration with flexibility to provide working capital as required.\nThe Board further confirms that the Company has been notified that the previously announced acquisition by Skylake of certain warrants in the Company will not proceed. Discussions remain ongoing and the Company will update the market as appropriate.\nThe Board confirms that, notwithstanding the above, the Company's fully diluted share capital position remains unchanged from that disclosed in the announcement dated 18 December 2025.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer of BMV, said:\n\"The increased level of interest we are seeing reflects a growing convergence between physical gold and modern financial infrastructure. BMV will prioritise partnerships that enhance execution capability without diverting focus from the core business. We remain focused on executing our gold streaming and treasury strategy, maintaining balan",

In addition, the Company has initiated a capital reorganisation programme to stabilise the balance sheet and establish a structured funding framework to support the Company's revised gold-focused streaming and treasury strategy.\nThe measures described below are at varying stages of implementation and are being progressed in parallel. All transactions, arrangements and initiatives referred to in this announcement are subject, where applicable, to regulatory approvals, shareholder authorities and the UK prospectus regime.\nThese actions have been undertaken in coordination with Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an investment vehicle controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah.\nFundraise and Acquisition of Legacy Loans\nPlacing and Subscription\nThe Company, subject to regulatory approvals, has completed a fundraise of a total of \u00a3627,450, before expenses, by way of issue of 418,300,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at 0.15 pence per share. Of the total of the monies raised, \u00a3500,000 was via a Placement with CMC Markets UK Plc (\"CMC\"), trading as CapX and the balance of \u00a3127,450 was via Subscription by HNW sophisticated investors.\nThe Placing, Subscription and admission of new ordinary shares to trading remains subject to regulatory approvals, shareholder authorities and the UK prospectus regime and the Company will update the market further as appropriate. The proceeds are expected to provide working capital and support the Company's transition to its gold-focused strategy.\nCMC acted as the Company's sole placing agent in respect of the Placing. BMV is also pleased to announce that CMC has been appointed as the Company's joint corporate broker.\nAcquisition of Legacy Loans - Related Party Transaction\nTwo legacy loans totalling \u00a3200,000 and due in December 2025 have been acquired by Skylake. Skylake has agreed, in principle, to extend repayment on mutually agreed terms, with no additional interest or penalties. The consolidation of these obligations under an aligned lender is intended to remove near-term liquidity pressure and provide balance-sheet stability while the Company advances its revised strategy.\nThe Board, excluding the interested director, reviewed the transaction under the Company's related-party governance protocols and approved it on the basis that the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.\nManagement and External Investor Equity Subscription Facility\nIn addition, the Company has established a framework for a \u00a33.25 million fixed-price equity subscription facility at 0.50 pence per share.\nKey features include:\n\u00b7\nissuance in tranches at the discretion of the Company\n\u00b7\nparticipation by management, Skylake and selected unconnected investors\n\u00b7\nflexibility in timing and sizing of equity issuance\n\u00b7\nstructuring intended to support orderly capital formation in compliance with applicable Listing Rules and regulatory requirements\nAny equity subscriptions under this framework are conditional and subject to the UK prospectus regime, applicable exemptions and regulatory approvals. There is no guarantee that a prospectus will be published or that any such subscriptions will complete.\nCapital Formation Summary (Indicative)\nThe following issuances are envisaged as part of the broader funding framework, subject to regulatory compliance:\n\u00b7\n418,300,000 shares at 0.15 pence raising \u00a3627,450\n\u00b7\nup to 650,000,000 shares at 0.50 pence under the equity subscription framework\nOn completion of all such issuances, total shares in issue would be 1,931,983,704.\nIntended Capital Reorganisation\nWarrant Cancellation\nSkylake has agreed to acquire two major blocks of deep-discount warrants, comprising more than 80 per cent of warrants exercisable at 0.23 pence, from former significant holders. It is intended that all such warrants acquired by Skylake will be cancelled. The cancellation process is being progressed and, once completed, is expected to remove a long-standing structural overhang and support a simplified capital structure ahead of future institutional engagement.\nSkylake Shareholding\nAs part of the stabilisation and capital-structure actions described above, Skylake expects to acquire up to 100,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company, subject to completion of the relevant transactions. These shares are being acquired in connection with the broader restructuring measures currently underway.\nBalance Sheet Stabilisation\nSubject to completion of the relevant steps, Skylake has agreed to:\n\u00b7\ncancel all deep-discount warrants acquired by it\n\u00b7\nextend the assigned legacy loans on mut",

This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives.\nGold-Streaming and Treasury Platform Development\nBMV is progressing a balanced set of gold-streaming and gold-linked transactions across Australia, West Africa, Central Asia and Southern Africa. These opportunities span producing sites, expansion-ready projects and modular processing operations. The portfolio has been designed to balance short-duration cash-impact with longer-life reserve exposure, consistent with BMV's focus on recurring gold flows rather than ownership of mining operations.\nThe transactions under development share common features:\n\u2022 near-term operational cashflow, in several cases from early 2026\n\u2022 structures ranging from senior-secured streams to rolling short-cycle arrangements\n\u2022 exposure to both stable producing assets and scalable long-life deposits\n\u2022 optional equity participation where it strengthens long-term returns\n\u2022 multi-year visibility on gold deliveries, with scope to recycle flows into future streams\nThe Directors believe that collectively, these transactions have the potential for material contribution to the Company's gold-backed treasury in the short-to-mid term. Several of these transactions have the potential to produce early ounces within the next 6-9 months, while others have been targeted as they offer multi-year, expansion-linked growth.\nBTC-Linked Opportunities\nTo complement the gold-streaming platform with optionality in settlement, liquidity and yield - while maintaining the Company's core focus on physical-gold reserves - BMV is assessing a limited number of BTC-linked opportunities within the permitted scope of its treasury operations. Any such exposure is expected to be structured through streaming or BTC-linked arrangements, with cashflows either converted into gold or retained within treasury.\nThe Company will progress and execute any BTC-linked arrangements with full consideration of the applicable class-test thresholds under the Listing Rules, ensuring that any transaction remains within the appropriate regulatory parameters.\nUpdate on Existing Gold Interests: Philippines (Batangas) and Korea\nThe Company provides an update on its legacy gold interests in the Philippines and Korea following renewed engagement by the new management team. Both assets are now undergoing structured review and reactivation efforts designed to bring greater clarity, discipline, and value potential into the portfolio.\nIn the Philippines (Batangas), the Company has re-established direct engagement with the local counterparty and begun a comprehensive assessment of the project's development position. Historically held on a passive basis, the asset is now being moved to an active oversight framework. Management and the local partner are working towards a defined 2026-27 development timetable supported by clear reporting and milestone tracking. The intention is to agree a detailed work plan and establish a formal project tracker during Q1 2026, providing the Company with improved visibility over the project's pathway and potential future cashflow.\nIn Korea, the Company has initiated a full reassessment of the project structure and development pathway. Discussions are progressing with potential partners, including the locally engaged group previously associated with BMV, to determine whether a technically capable and well-capitalised local lead party can be put in place. In parallel, a formal legal review of the permitting and appeal position will commence in January 2026. This will provide a definitive understanding of the regulatory basis on which the asset can be advanced and will inform the decision between a development path or an orderly exit.\nOver the coming months, the Company will focus on establishing clear development options and execution responsibility across both assets. Key milestones include agreement of the Philippines development plan in early Q1 2026; confirmation by end December 2025 of whether the current Korea partner will assume a lead role; a legal assessment of the Korean permit status in January 2026; and a full viability review for Korea by the end of February 2026. The Company will provide further updates as progress is made.\nUpdate on Bitcoin Mining Equipme",

An update will follow in due course.\n\u00b7\nSelective mining-adjacent investments -\nEvaluation of near-term cashflow opportunities that support and complement the streaming and treasury model.\nThis strategy positions BMV as a focused, capital-efficient platform combining the stability of physical gold with the scalability of streaming structures.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer, of BMV stated:\n\"BMV's new strategy positions the company as a next-generation gold streaming and treasury platform, delivering long-term, compounding value through disciplined reserve growth, structured yield, and direct exposure to physical bullion.

A draft has since been submitted and remains under active review. While the process is taking longer than first anticipated, the Board continues to expect approval and publication in the near term. Successful completion will provide the Company with a durable framework for growth and capital formation under its \"gold + digital gold;\nReserve & Rail\n\" strategy. At present, the Board is not in a position to provide definitive guidance on the size or timing of any raise, as these will depend on the outcome of ongoing investor discussions.\n\u00a32 Million Convertible Funding Facility\nOn 25 June 2025, the Company announced Heads of Terms with an investment vehicle managed by Mr Sath Ganesarajah for a \u00a32 million facility at 0% interest, maturing 31 December 2026 and convertible at 2p per share. On 29 August 2025, the Company executed a definitive agreement with Skylake Management LLP, a UK-domiciled investment vehicle. Activation of the facility and the initial drawdown remain subject to establishing a UK entity, a UK bank account, and institutional-grade bitcoin custody. These processes are in progress, and no completion date can yet be confirmed. The facility constitutes a related-party transaction under applicable rules.\nBitcoin Equipment and Streaming Transaction\nOn 14 July 2025, the Company announced the acquisition of 756 ASIC bitcoin mining units with a combined hashrate of approximately 63.7 PH/s.

The Company is now complementing its traditional hard\u2011asset gold mining project interest with a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy - viewing BTC as a digital reserve asset, essentially 'digital gold'.\nBoard and Leadership Changes\nIn order to achieve the rapid delivery of the Company's gold and 'digital gold' strategy, including advancing early-stage negotiations to secure an anchor streaming BTC asset and identified high-value strategic transactions and near-term funding opportunities, the Company has restructured its Board, with immediate effect.\nSath\u202fGanesarajah, who was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman on 25 June 2025, has now been appointed as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Director with immediate effect. Sath will lead the Company through this pivotal development and execution phase.\nJonathan Morley-Kirk, Non-Executive Director, has been reappointed as Non-Executive Chairman, a position he previously held.\nAidan\u202fBishop has stepped down as Interim CEO and from the Board of Directors. Aidan will continue to work for the Company in a consultancy capacity over the short term. The Company will continue benefiting from Aidan's knowledge of the Philippine and South Korea gold projects, as well as his geographic location in Asia. In the coming months Aidan will work closely with the Philippine partner company in advancing the gold project and assist the Company in engaging with potential strategic partners for the South Korean gold projects. The Company has been notified that two South Korean companies have shown an interest in the South Korean gold projects - one is a mining exploration company, and the other is a construction company. Whilst this is encouraging, it is at a very early stage and there can be no guarantee that this will progress. Aidan has agreed that he will remain a shareholder and will not sell any shares for at least the period he remains engaged by the Company.\nStrategic Execution and Funding Update\nTo support its integrated strategy of gold plus 'digital gold', BMV is pursuing several key workstreams. These include the Company's capital table optimisation, preparing the Company for further leadership appointments to support anticipated growth, the formation of a formal Treasury Policy and reporting framework in line with good corporate governance practices, active engagement with strategic investors and the continued preparation of a Prospectus to raise a minimum of \u00a310 million.\nThese initiatives are sequenced to ensure that BMV enters its next phase of growth with a solid and credible structure and platform suitable to attract institutional capital and to support an active pipeline of treasury-linked opportunities, while providing sufficient flexibility to scale high-quality, asset-backed positions on the balance sheet.\nOn 25 June 2025, the Company announced that it had signed Heads of Terms with an investment vehicle managed by Sath Ganesarajah to provide a \u00a32 million funding facility, carrying 0% interest and convertible into equity at 2p per share. A definitive agreement is now expected to be signed by the end of August. In preparation for this, the Company has been engaging with digital asset custodians and trade execution desks.\nThe Company announced on 14 July 2025 that advanced discussions were taking place regarding the Bitcoin equipment purchased by the Company being on-sold under a streaming arrangement. This would mark the Company's first \"Streaming Bitcoin\" transaction and could generate more than 30 Bitcoin for the Company over a three-year period, subject to network conditions and final terms, without incurring further costs. The Company is pleased to report that progress has been made and now expects that the transaction will complete before the end of September 2025.\nNew Website\nThe Company has launched a new website hosted on the Investor Hub platform which can be accessed here: www.bmvbtc.com.\nThere will be further updates made to the website over the coming weeks. The website will have various interactive features designed to enable greater engagement with shareholders.\nShareholders and prospective investors are highly encouraged to sign up for updates using this link: https://bmvbtc.com/auth/signup\nOutgoing Interim CEO and Director, Aidan Bishop, commented:\n\"I look forward to supporting Sath and the Company going forward as a shareholder as well as working closely with our partners in the Philippines as the gold project advances.

My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\nBluebird is no longer simply a gold mining development company. We are evolving into a platform that blends real asset exposure with digital economics - leveraging gold, Bitcoin, and structured yield strategies.\nThe recent uplift in our share price, and the resulting fair value adjustment on outstanding warrants, is a reflection of this pivot, not a traditional operating loss. It is an accounting movement tied to market optimism, not cash outflow.\nThis next phase is about execution: progressing streaming arrangements, unlocking value from our asset base, and broadening our exposure to digital asset-linked returns. Our legacy projects remain central - we are simply applying more innovative and commercially efficient models to extract their value.\nWe look forward to providing further updates on our plans over the coming months as our strategy progresses.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nSath Ganesarajah Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\none@bmvbtc.com\n(new website under development)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

If concluded, this would mark the Company's first \"Streaming Bitcoin\" transaction - applying structured commercial models to gain exposure to bitcoin economics while preserving balance sheet efficiency. Over a three-year period, the transaction could generate more than 30 bitcoins for the Company, depending on network conditions and final streaming terms. It is expected that the Company will incur no further costs relating to the anticipated streaming transaction.\nThis mirrors the structure of Bluebird's recently announced Philippine gold project, where the Company secured a 10% profit share over the life of the mine, alongside milestone bonus payments of USD 250,000 for every 5,000 oz of gold sold above $3,000/oz.\nBoth transactions reflect the Company's evolving treasury strategy - focused on building long-term asymmetric exposures to gold and bitcoin, through structured streams as well as direct holdings. A broader update on this strategy, including additional initiatives, will be provided in the coming weeks.\nBluebird Non-Executive Chairman Sath Ganesarajah commented:\n\"This is a small but symbolic step in our roadmap. We're building a portfolio of long-dated, asymmetric exposures across gold and bitcoin. This latest move aligns with our strategy to generate returns through disciplined structuring and intelligent asset positioning. Once concluded this streaming contract would result in a substantial return on capital. Furthermore, I look forward to providing updates prior to the end of the month as we move towards the execution of a definitive agreement relating to the \u00a32m funding facility that was announced on 25 June 2025 with \u00a31m being made available to purchase Bitcoin as well as the appointment of a new CEO.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nSath Ganesarajah Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\none@bmvbtc.com\n(new website under development)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The key terms of the agreement as previously announced on 24 June 2025, are as follows:\n\u00b7\nBluebird will receive a 10% profit share from the Philippine gold project in perpetuity over the life of the mine with the implementation of a transparent dividend policy to ensure cash receipts.\n\u00b7\nFurthermore, Bluebird will receive additional bonus payments of USD 250,000 at every gold sales milestone of 5,000 oz subject to the average gold price over the period being over $3,000/oz.\nThe Philippine project has a JORC compliant resource estimate of 440,000 oz of gold over the total area of the licenses. Bluebird will incur no further expenditure but will retain certain rights of inspection of production plans and records as well as being able to appoint an observer to board meetings. As announced on the 5 June 2025, the Company intends to convert cash receipts that it will receive in the future from streaming revenues into bitcoin. This is in line with the Company's strategy to convert physical gold to \"digital gold\" i.e. bitcoin.\nFurther to the Issue of Equity that was announced on 16 June 2025 and following receipt of the Direct Subscription funds and the subsequent issue of shares, the Company has made an application for the admission to trading of\n96,586,957\nshares. Admission is expected on or around 10 July 2025.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 863,683,704 ordinary shares of\nnil par value\n. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"The signing of the agreement is a positive step forward in positioning the Company to potentially receive substantial future revenues in perpetuity over the life of the mine. This will represent a significant multiple over the investment made in the Philippines. Our new bitcoin treasury strategy is starting to take real shape, and there will be further news to come this month.\n\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company believes that the approach of combining risk adjusted gold and silver streaming revenues with a professionally managed Bitcoin Treasury approach will receive a premium multiple valuation as has been evidenced by pure Bitcoin Treasury plays such as Strategy and Metaplanet.\nThe crypto space is constantly evolving with the regulatory acceptance of this asset class globally becoming commonplace and derived demand for products that provide investors exposure to this only likely to increase in the Company's view.\nThe added benefit of publishing a prospectus is that it will ensure that the Company's headroom i.e. its capacity to raise future capital, is refreshed and thus is not temporarily restricted which will empower the Company to increase its digital asset base further in the future at an accelerated pace - an increasingly important factor as the available pool of newly mined Bitcoin becomes ever more scarce.\nGiven the much larger global capital pool that emanates from the U.S., the Company is also currently investigating the avenue of a simultaneous listing of the Company's shares on the US Nasdaq OTCQB. A further announcement in this regard will be made in the near future.\nFrom Monday, the Company will have three Non-Executive Directors, with Sath\nGanesarajah as Non-Executive Chairman, alongside Jonathan Morley-Kirk and C\u00e9dric Simonet.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"Ahead of our new Chairman Sath\nGanesarajah f\normally joining the Board on Monday we continue to rapidly recalibrate Bluebird towards our pioneering 'gold + digital gold' strategy. The Company has also commenced an onboarding process with a leading institution for bitcoin trade execution and safe custody services which will be essential as we develop the business further.\nAs I prepare to hand the baton of the Company over to a new CEO in the coming weeks, I have never been more excited with regards to the future of Bluebird.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

An initial drawdown of \u00a31 million shall be made available upon execution of a Definitive Agreement where all the proceeds will be used to buy bitcoin. The funding shall be convertible at the investor's election at a price of 2p per Bluebird share.\nMr\nSath Ganesarajah shall join the Board of Directors of Bluebird on 30 June 2025 as Non-Executive Chairman. His biography is set out below.\nSath Ganesarajah, 43, British\nSath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM).\nHe is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.\nEarlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets.\nSath holds a BSc in Management from the London School of Economics and a Postgraduate Certificate in Mathematics from Birkbeck. He has also completed executive programmes in Blockchain Strategy (University of Oxford) and Data Science.\nThe Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy.\nMr Ganesarajah commented:\n\"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"I am delighted to welcome Sath to the board of Bluebird. Over the course of our discussions, it was evident that the scale of his ambition with regards to building out the potential for Bluebird is precisely what the Company requires as it continues to focus and evolve its unique new trajectory. This initial funding to buy Bitcoin is also on great terms for shareholders evidencing Sath's confidence in the current underlying asset base and the future strategy. The Company is moving as quickly as possible to capture the opportunity from the enthusiasm surrounding 'digital gold'. I believe that we are still very early in the cycle and despite market volatility we are positioning to capture upside for our shareholders. I look forward to updating the market in near term with continued major catalysts to drive the continued re-rating and market evaluation of the Company and its prospects\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company expects the agreement to conclude imminently.\nThe key terms, subject to execution, are as follows:\n\u00b7\nBluebird will receive a 10% profit share from the Philippine gold project in perpetuity over the life of the mine with the implementation of a transparent dividend policy to ensure cash receipts.\n\u00b7\nFurthermore, Bluebird will receive additional bonus royalty payments of USD 250,000 at every gold sales milestone of 5,000 oz subject to the average gold price over the period being over $3,000/oz\nThe Philippine project has a JORC compliant resource estimate of 440,000 oz of gold over the total area of the licenses. Bluebird will incur no further expenditure but will retain certain rights of inspection of production plans and records. As announced on the 5 June 2025, the Company intends to convert cash receipts that it will receive in the future from streaming revenues into bitcoin. This is in line with the Company's strategy (that we believe is a first in the UK) to convert physical gold to \"digital gold\" i.e. bitcoin.\nThe Company further confirms that it has received the proceeds from the Direct Subscription that was announced on 16 June 2025 and will make a further announcement in due course regarding the issuance of the shares and Admission to trading.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"We are now on the cusp of executing the agreement in the Philippines which will open the door to the potential of substantial revenue over time for the Company and will represent a significant multiple over the investment made in the Philippines. Our new bitcoin treasury strategy is starting to take real shape, and I look forward to providing further updates in short order.\n\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Direct Subscription was taken up by select professional investors and crypto investors. The Company will issue the equity upon receipt of the subscription funds, due to be received on or around 16 June 2025. Furthermore, Aidan Bishop has agreed to subscribe for \u00a315,000 at the same price (\"Director Subscription\").\nIn addition to the Direct Subscription and the Director Subscription, Catalyse Capital Ltd (\"Catalyse\"), has issued a Conversion Notice for the remaining balance of an outstanding loan and associated interest totalling \u00a360,000 (\"Loan Conversion\") under the terms of the loan agreement at \u00a30.0023 per share. Furthermore, Catalyse has elected to convert \u00a350,000 (\"Loan Conversion\") due from its loan facility at \u00a30.005p per share, that was announced on 30 September 2024. In addition, \u00a330,000 of equity will be issued to a service provider at a price of \u00a30.005p per share (\"Fee Shares\").\nThe Direct Subscription, Director Subscription, Loan Conversions and Fee Shares, upon issue, will utilise the full existing permissible headroom available to the Company to allot new shares without publication of a prospectus.\nFurthermore, the Company has received notice from Catalyse Capital Ltd and Tracarta Ltd (\"Warrant Holders\") that under the terms of the Warrant Instrument, relating to the funding announced on 30 September 2024, that the warrants will now reset to an exercise price of \u00a30.0023 per share with the maturity on 30 September 2027 being unchanged. The warrant reset will result in the Warrant Holders now holding 93,755,435 warrants (\"Restricted Warrants\") each after the distribution described below.\nThe Warrant Holders have agreed with the Company that no warrants will be exercised prior to 1 March 2026, and they have agreed to assign 25,750,000 of the Restricted Warrants to subscribers of the Direct Subscription who have agreed to abide by the same restrictions. The Restricted Warrant Certificates will be issued to subscribers of the Direct Subscription upon receipt of the subscription funds.\nThe subscription funds, when received, will solidify Bluebird's balance sheet, negate the requirement to draw down further from the Loan facility announced on the 30 September 2024 and allow for the acceleration of our renewed focus and pivot of marrying future Physical Gold streaming revenues with an active Bitcoin Treasury management focus. This is now complemented by the announcement of 12 June 2025 in which the Company, subject to final agreement, will augment this approach through the opportunistic purchase of 746 Bitcoin mining machines with related hosting capabilities that will utilise low-cost energy inputs, thus ensuring profitability.\nThe Company intends to continue with its \"capital light\" approach to Plc overhead as it navigates through this transitory period as this new strategy unfolds. To that extent, the Company will accelerate the search for a new CEO and looks forward to the imminent conclusion of the agreement regarding its Philippine project that is expected to result in perpetual exposure to the upside of the project without any further costs.\nThe Company will update the market shortly following the receipt of the proceeds of the Direct Subscription.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"Solidifying the balance sheet including reducing debt to a minimal level is a very important first step as the Company commences its new journey on marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is \"\ndigital gold\"\naka Bitcoin and the growing global appetite for this nascent asset class. It is a positive sign that both professional and seasoned crypto investors will be joining the shareholder register as part of this raise and I expect that more will follow as the strategy unfolds in due course and we conclude our search for a new CEO with cryptocurrency expertise and experience\n\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Discussions have now progressed meaningfully with the Philippine partner to an advanced stage whereby the Company now expects to conclude an agreement within a matter of weeks that would effectively extend the Company's free carry beyond the issuance of the key permits all the way through to production. The Company is seeking to retain a net profit interest in the Philippine project throughout the life of mine, importantly without any of the associated costs.\nFurther to the announcement on 27 May 2025, the Company's lawyer in South Korea has prepared the respective legal documentation to file the administrative lawsuit prior to 18 June 2025. The Company intends to seek to preserve the value of its projects in South Korea despite recent setbacks and will continue to actively identify opportunities whereby these projects could progress without further capital requirements from the Company.\nBluebird has been actively considering its strategy for some time now in order to enter into the next phase of its life. Given the anticipated agreement in the Philippines and the ongoing process in South Korea, the Company believes that it should adopt an innovative approach to its Corporate Treasury and any future revenues that it may generate from its exposure to its mining projects.\nGold has various industrial uses as well as being used for jewelry. Gold has been considered as a 'store of value' for centuries and to this day, central banks worldwide, buy and store gold. However, golds' position as a store of value has been under threat due to the rising global adoption of bitcoin, which some commentators have described as 'digital gold' and many have even cited its superiority over gold as a store of value. Some of the reasons for the rising adoption of bitcoin is as a response to expansive monetary policy by central banks, high debt-to-GDP ratios globally, rising geopolitical tensions and continued concerns about persistent inflation.\nNew bitcoin is mined using bitcoin mining machines, known as bitcoin miners, which are specialised designed to solve complex mathematical puzzles. These machines use powerful hardware. Miners are rewarded for their efforts with newly created bitcoin and transaction fees. There is a hard cap to the total number of bitcoin and there will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin.\nThe Company believes there is an opportunity to augment its strategy whereby it can seek to convert future revenues from its mining projects into bitcoin - essentially converting gold to 'digital gold'. Furthermore, in addition to this, the Company intends to adopt a policy of holding bitcoin on its balance sheet as a treasury reserve asset and will make further announcements regarding this in due course.\nCombining income streams from gold mining projects and recycling these revenues into a proactive \"Bitcoin in Treasury\" management approach, whilst maintaining a minimal corporate overhead, we believe will be a first for a publicly listed mining company in the UK. Companies that have adopted bitcoin into their treasury strategy globally across public markets have been enjoying significant investor interest as well as substantial premiums to Net Asset Value (NAV) that have challenged traditional financial metrics as a basis of valuation. Our present market capitalisation offers our shareholders the opportunity to position themselves at a ground floor valuation in comparison to other peers.\nThe Company can report that in sync with this new approach it is actively seeking to identify a new CEO with experience in the sphere of digital assets that can spearhead this initiative. In this regard, several discussions with potential persons are taking place and ongoing.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"I am very pleased with the progress of discussions in the Philippines which are looking very positive and will enable, if successfully completed, Bluebird to maintain an ongoing exposure with zero future cash commitments.\nOn a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level.\nBy adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity ",

The Company has been informed by its legal advisors that the Board of Audit and Inspection (BOAI) have rejected the arguments presented by the Company for the issuance of the Mountain Temporary Use Permit (MTUP). The Company's lawyers strongly disagree with the determination from the Board of Audit and Inspection citing that it has insufficient legal basis. The Company has instructed its legal advisors to proceed to the next stage of the process which is filing of an administrative lawsuit. This process typically takes 6 to 8 months to conclude.\nThe Board of Audit and Inspection is an administrative body and not a judicial court whose primary function is the audit and inspection of the accounts of state and administrative bodies. The Company's legal advisors note that there is a reasonable possibility that a court ruling could differ significantly from the BOAI's decision, as judicial review often applies a stricter interpretation of procedural fairness and substantive evaluation criteria than administrative bodies such as the BOAI. The Directors note, that whilst this is not the conclusion of the process to secure the MTUP, there can be no guarantee that the administrative lawsuit will be successful. The cost of the lawsuit is insignificant.\nThe status of the Korean projects is set out below:\nKochang\nThe Kochang project was awarded a Mining Right on\n6 December 2019\n. This allows for mining operations to commence subject to further permits, namely the MTUP. The MTUP application covers an area of ground that is approximately 340 square metres. The landowner and the immediate host village where the project is located had previously given their formal consent and remain supportive of the project. Under the terms of the Mining Right, the Company is required to either commence operations within a three-year period or make a Qualifying Investment of KRW 100,000,000 (circa \u00a355,000) during any one year. At the end of this period a further three-year period is granted to either commence operations or make an additional Qualifying Investment. The\nMining Registration Office\ndid not require the Company to make a Qualifying Investment at Kochang due to undergoing the process with the Board of Audit and Inspection and the Company will not be required to do so until the conclusion of the legal process. If the outcome from the legal process is negative the Company is still entitled to make a Qualifying Investment and could also make a fresh application for an MTUP. Given the opinion from the Board of Audit and Inspection, the joint venture at Kochang has yet to be triggered.\nGubong\nThe Gubong project was awarded a Mining Right on\n7 November 2019\n. This allows for mining operations to commence subject to further permits, namely the MTUP. An MTUP application was previously withdrawn pending the outcome of the Kochang process and pending receiving formal consent of the community despite this not being a legal requirement to secure an MTUP. Whilst the key landowner has indicated that they are willing to enter into an agreement with the Company regarding the use of their land upon reasonable terms, wider community acceptance of the project has not been forthcoming despite the ongoing best efforts of the local partner.\nThe Company made a Qualifying Investment at Gubong in February 2024. No further Qualifying Investment is required to be made within 3 years from the previous investment date.\nThe Company has informed its local partner in Korea of the BOAI decision and considering such and the fact that there is presently not a wide enough community acceptance of the project at Gubong it has been agreed to suspend the joint venture at this time until a clearer indication of the likelihood of community and local government acceptance becomes evident.\nThe Company, at this time, retains 100% ownership of both its projects in Korea and maintains a very low-cost base, sufficient to remain compliant with the obligations of the Mining Rights that it has been granted. The Company will consider further its strategy in South Korea to determine how best progress can be achieved.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"This is clearly not the news that we had been hoping for. For a project to move forward from the exploration phase to the extractive phase, in any jurisdiction, both community and local government support is vital. Unfortunately, this has remained elusive in Korea and clearly needs a com",

The Company will now enter into discussions with a view to determine if this may potentially be the best path to create most value for shareholders. The Company wishes to place emphasis on the fact that no formal offer has been received and there can be no guarantee that an offer will be received or if it would result in an agreement being concluded.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"The recent renewal in the Philippines is clearly a positive development and given the advanced nature of the project it is encouraging to see a growing level of interest. I look forward to updating the market in due course.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This results in an improved IRR of 44% and an NPV10 of US$70.5 million based on Bluebird's net 75% current ownership.\nWhilst the reinterpretation is highly encouraging, we also make the point that the envisaged project initially focuses on a smaller project footprint the exhibits higher grade ore zones. The Company therefore expects the economic profile of the project to be further improved from that of the original PFS. A full updated project economic feasibility will be worked as part of the Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility (DMPF) work that will now be undertaken.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

The key condition of the renewal is that a Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility (DMPF) is filed within the period. The DMPF is a key approval that allows for production to commence. Our local partner intends to accelerate this process.\nThe Company reiterates that it is\nfree carried\nfor the entire renewal period until the point of approval of the DMPF with 100% of the costs to be borne by its local partner. The work to be undertaken as part of the DMPF will enable accurate forecasted production economics to be determined. The last Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) was published by the previous project operators in June 2016 that demonstrated attractive positive economics based upon a gold price of circa US$ 1,275. Based upon a current gold price environment that is now over US$ 3,000 per ounce and coupled with the fact that the project is now more targeted than was previously envisaged in 2016, with a focus on the higher-grade ore zones, the Company expects the DMPF to demonstrate a vastly improved production economics scenario. We are working with our local partners preparing new project economics and will update the market in this regard in the near term.\nAs a reminder, the Project has a current JORC compliant resource of 440,000 ounces, including a maiden ore reserve of 128,000 ounces (including silver credits) as well as multiple additional targets providing extensive resource upside. The initial envisaged mining area has an initial footprint of 2.6 hectares that ensures both for a low-cost operation and, importantly, an environmentally sustainable operation.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"I am delighted to bring this positive news to shareholders today which is a major milestone for the Company and a step closer to a real value realisation event after many years. The Company looks forward to working closely with its local partner as the project progresses. As the development proceeds at pace now with the DMPF, we can expect our current 75% interest in the project to substantially increase in value over the ensuing period. Furthermore, given that the project had historically been written down to zero in the accounts we anticipate next year a material write back of value to be reflected in the Company's books.\nI am to return to Asia within the next several days for discussions with our local partners to move forward at pace with this exciting development whilst we wait for news of the MTUP in Korea.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Gaining the required permissions is challenging in any jurisdiction and is subject to rigorous regulatory processes that evaluate both technical and environmental standards.\nOur focus continues to be on advancing the development of our high-grade precious metal projects, which consists of the Kochang Gold and Silver Mine (\nKochang\n) and Gubong Gold Mine (\nGubong\n) in South Korea, and the Batangas Gold Project (\nBatangas\n) in the Philippines.\nOur objective of creating long term value for shareholders by bringing our projects into production remains the core proposition of the Board. Whilst progress has been frustratingly slow in South Korea the Philippines has made more progress as the Group seeks to gain a further two-year extension of the exploration period within the context of the twenty-five year mining license. This extension once granted will allow the completion of the required technical and environmental studies as part of the process to secure the two remaining permissions to allow for construction to commence. Our local partners are proving to be invaluable in seeking these permissions.\nWith an optimal structure in place, we believe we can develop the assets and drive value for shareholders. I would like to thank you for your patience but can assure you we have been doing all we can to make progress. The in-ground value of the portfolio remains constant and something we remain focussed on realising. The Board believes the sum of the parts are not reflected in the share price; despite the delays we have experienced in South Korea.\nOn a macro scale, the gold price environment is also positive, with many commentators highlighting that geopolitical uncertainty and ever-increasing government debt is underpinning the long-term fundamentals for gold as an asset class. Worth noting is that the current gold price of over USD 3,000 per oz is a significant premium to what the gold price was when preliminary economic analysis was undertaken for our projects.\nThe Company has undergone significant changes to its Board during the period. In July both Charles Barclay and Clive Sinclair-Poulton stepped down from the Board and Colin Patterson moved to Non-Executive Director. Subsequently after the period, Colin stepped down from the Board after the period for family related reasons and Aidan Bishop became Interim CEO. I would like to thank Colin who has been an invaluable part of the team and has invested considerably over the years, and on behalf of the Board, I wish him well. I am pleased that he continues to be a supportive shareholder. Furthermore, I would like to thank both Charles and Clive for their contribution in the development of the Company and wish them both well in their retirement. The Company is currently actively seeking to recruit an additional member to the Board as well as a CEO with the appropriate technical and industry expertise.\nJonathan Morley-Kirk\nChairman\nInterim Chief Executive's Comment\nWith many of the general operations and corporate issues covered in the Chairman's report, I want to take this opportunity to draw to shareholders attention the Batangas project, being the first project in the portfolio when the Company listed in 2016.\nShortly after listing the development of the Batangas project was put on hold due to a change in Government in the Philippines with the investment in the project being written down to USD Nil in 2019. This project has since \"\ncome back to life\n\" largely due to the fact that when the government changed in 2022 a far more supportive approach was taken towards the mining industry as a whole.\nThe entire Batangas project area has a total JORC compliant resource of 440,000 ounces, including a maiden ore reserve of 128,000 ounces (including silver credits). The high-grade Lobo area is now the focus due to its abundance of data, high prospectivity and two 25-year Mineral Production Sharing Agreements.\nLobo has an initial Probable JORC Compliant Ore Reserves of 171,000 tons at 6.6 g/t for 36,000 ounces of gold excluding silver credits based primarily on the Southwest Breccia area of the licences, which can be mined in the first 18 months of any operation. There is an Indicated resource of 82,000 oz au that is perceived as easily convertible.\nOur local partner has commenced the technical and environmental work that is required for the remai",

The Company's strategy remains focused on advancing its three high-grade gold projects through joint venture partnerships with local companies. The portfolio is estimated to contain c. 1.8 million ounces of gold.\nIn line with the above strategy, which provides Bluebird with a free carry across its portfolio, the Company's Joint venture partner in the Philippines has paid the 2025 licence fee for the Batangas Gold Project as part of the key renewal process. The Company is actively exploring avenues for potential early monetisation. Given the value disconnect between the current market capitalisation and the Batangas gold project alone, particularly as gold approaches $3,000 per oz, it is the Board's intention to address this as expediently as possible.\nBatangas is a 1,160-hectare licence with two 25-year Mineral Production Sharing Agreements ('MPSA') granted. The Project has a current JORC compliant resource of 440,000 ounces, including a maiden ore reserve of 128,000 ounces (including silver credits) as well as multiple additional targets providing extensive resource upside. The local partner remains focussed on work required for the submission for the grant of a Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility and the Environmental Study for an operating gold mine at the Lobo high-grade gold mining target.\nIn South Korea, the decision regarding the Mountain Temporary Use Permit ('MTUP') for the Kochang Gold and Silver Mine ('Kochang') from the Board of Audit and Inspection ('BAI'), has unfortunately been delayed and is now expected in Q2 2025. The delay is due to a slow bureaucracy and other high priority cases that have \"jumped ahead\" of this process, but the Company has been assured that a decision will be forthcoming. It is important to note that the lawyers continue to stress that legally there are no impediments to a positive outcome by the department. The team is due shortly in South Korea to meet with the JV partner and advisors.\nCorporately, due to family reasons, Colin Patterson is stepping down from the Board with immediate effect. The Board would like to thank Colin for his stewardship and support over the years and wish him and his family well.\nWhilst departing from the Board, Colin remains positive about the projects, stating that: \"I still firmly believe that the projects are excellent and at today's gold price would be hugely profitable when given the opportunity to develop them\n.\"\nThe Company is actively seeking a suitable replacement for Mr Patterson, someone who has the technical expertise to expedite a production plan in tandem with the Company's local project partners.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"The Board would like to express its gratitude to Colin for his commitment and support to the Company over the years and wishes him and his family all the best. He remains a supportive shareholder and, as with our partners, continues to believe in the significant inherent value of the portfolio. We are now actively seeking a suitable replacement with production experience to assist our JV partners in achieving the objectives of all stakeholders and advancing our portfolio toward production.\n\"With an estimated 1.8 million ounces of gold in the ground and a favourable gold price environment, our partners continue to recognise the immense value these projects hold. The timely satisfaction of the license payment in the Philippines underscores their commitment. Whilst it is frustrating to experience a further delay in South Korea, I am encouraged by the fact that the Board of Audit and Inspection have at least indicated that we are close to the 'front of the queue'.\"\n\"As we are now into our 10th year, I believe the time has now come to look to realise our extensive time and capital investment at Batangas and I will be focused on achieving this goal as soon as possible.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nAbout Bluebird\nLondon listed Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd is focused on developing high grade, low capex gold projects.

Gubong is moderately dipping with 9 veins extending 500m below surface and known to extend at least a further 250m. However, the production opportunity for Bluebird prior to looking at deepening the mine is the 25 levels already developed with all the remnants and unmined areas left by the original miners.

With additional sampling, mapping, pit modelling and grade analysis, plus the fact that Gubong is an orogenic deposit, which typically have a depth of 2km compared to the current depth of 500m, the Board believe it has a geological potential of 1 million + oz Au in-situ, plus an estimated additional 300,000 oz Au from satellite ore bodies.\nKochang is an epithermal vein deposit with parallel vertical ore bodies covering 8.3 sq km that reportedly produced 110,000 oz of gold and 5.9 million oz of silver between 1961 and 1975.

The loan will be disbursed in 12 equal monthly tranches commencing on the 10 October 2024. The Board believes that the Company is materially undervalued and as such, the Loan allows Bluebird to receive capital without having to utilise the equity capital markets, where it believes a potential funding would be at a significant discount to the current price and therefore unnecessarily dilutive.\nAs announced, to enable shareholders and new investors to participate alongside the Directors who are converting fees totalling \u00a3286,076 owed into equity, the Company is conducting an equity raise (\"the Placing\"), whereby any net cash sums received will be netted on a pro rata basis against the loan capital to be drawn, reducing the total loan commitment. This ensures that the Company will receive funding of at least \u00a3350,000 which will provide sufficient working capital through to the last quarter of 2025 and anticipated progress at both the Company's Korean projects and Batangas in the Philippines.\nThe Placing is being conducted at a price of 1p per share through a book building exercise that will now conclude close of business on 9 October 2024. The Placing has an attached one-for-one warrant with an exercise price of 1.25p per share and a 12-month life. These warrants carry an accelerator clause whereby, if the 10-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is above 1.5p per share for 10 consecutive days, then the holder must either exercise the warrant or it becomes void.\nDue to the complexity of the placing and inclusion of warrants, the Company has decided it would not be appropriate to include a retail offer. Accordingly, the Placing is being solely and fully coordinated by the Company's broker SI Capital. To subscribe for the Placing Shares, existing shareholders and other qualified investors should communicate their interest to SI Capital via their stockbroker as SI Capital cannot take direct orders from individual private investors who are not existing clients. Each bid should state the number of Placing Shares they wish to subscribe for at the 1p per share Placing Price.

The loan funding commitment effectively underwrites the funding requirements of the Company for the upcoming 12 months.

The staged US$5 million investment, by a consortium of South Korean businessman with whom we have been working with for some time, provided Bluebird with a free carry to first production in return for up to 60% of the Project, previously the country's second largest gold mine.\nIn addition to a significant capital injection, which is non-dilutive at the top co level, the agreement highlights the belief by both parties that the c.1.3Moz Au Gubong Mine can be brought into production. As the gold price indicates, there is increased appetite for investment in bullion, with significant buying coming from Asia. There is also regional recognition that exposure to gold can be garnered through the participation directly in mining projects, which can only be good news for companies such as Bluebird and the sector. With the gold pricing environment positive and many forecasts pointing to increases, some beyond US$ 3,500 per oz, we envisage further interest in our activities.\nWith our documented issues with permitting on-going, the Board recognised that the optimal structure to advance its projects was via Joint Ventures with local partners, who can provide an increased understanding of operating in-country as well as corporate and planning expertise at local, district and governmental levels. This model was successfully implemented in the Philippines last year at the Batangas Gold Project where a c.US$2 million investment commitment was signed. As a result, the work required for the submission for the grant of a Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility for an operating gold mine at the Lobo high-grade gold mining target has commenced, as has the work programme for Environmental Impact Study. This forms the core of the environmental baseline studies needed to be conducted in line with the requirements for the issuance of an Environmental Compliance Certificate.\nPost the period end, we also signed a JV agreement to develop the Kochang Gold and Silver Mine in South Korea. The Board believes that at Kochang, initial modular production can be started between 6 to 9 months following the receival of the relevant permitting, with the initial plan being to process via a toll treatment agreement. We await the outcome of the Board of Audit and Inspection process, which despite being informed that this was a relatively short process, it is frustratingly still on-going.\nThe\nUS$2 million staged investment with the same consortium of local businessman which invested in Gubong means that all three of our projects are now under JV. In essence, the Company has c.US$9 million committed to develop its projects, which have an estimated cumulative 1.8Moz Au and is on a free carry structure, greatly reducing its reliance on the capital markets.\nTo reflect this funded business model, the Board has also been restructured. Executive Director Charles Barclay and Non-executive Director Clive Sinclair-Poulton stepped down, and Colin Patterson moved to Non-executive Director. Aidan Bishop, who was instrumental in signing the JVs with the Company's South Korean and Filipino partners, is interim CEO and I remain as Non-executive Chairman.\nTo fund the business going forward, we have entered into a binding term sheet to provide a loan facility of up to \u00a3350,000 with Catalyse Capital Ltd, a long running and supportive shareholder of Bluebird, as well as nominated co investees. The loan structure allows for us to receive capital without having to utilise the equity capital markets, where we believe a potential funding would be at a significant discount to the current price and therefore unnecessarily dilutive. Concurrently the Company is also conducting an equity raise (\"the Placing\"), at a price of 1p per share through a book building exercise that will conclude on 4 October 2024. The Placing has an attached one-for-one warrant with an exercise price of 1.25p per share and a 12 month life. Any net cash sums raised in the Placing will be netted on a pro rata basis against the loan capital to be drawn, reducing the total loan commitment. For full details please see the Financing announcement also released today.\nLooking ahead, Bluebird's strategy remains focused on de",

Additionally, the Board and certain advisors have agreed to convert fees outstanding into equity of the Company, underlining their support for Bluebird and belief in the underlying value of the project portfolio.\nBluebird has a Joint Venture development model in place with local in-country partners in South Korea and the Philippines, providing c.US$9 million to advance its high-grade gold mines to production, providing a free carry for the Company. With the current price of its shares trading at what the Board believes to be a material disconnect to the Company's fundamental value, the Company has chosen to implement a loan agreement with supportive shareholders as the most effective and non-dilutive financing option.\nProposed Loan\nUnder the terms of the Loan, Catalyse and nominated co investees are providing an unsecured loan of up to \u00a3350,000 to Bluebird. Concurrently with this funding, the Company is also conducting an equity raise (\"the Placing\"), which is anticipated to commence on 30 September 2024 at a price of 1p per share through a book building exercise that will conclude on 4 October 2024. The Placing has an attached one-for-one warrant with an exercise price of 1.25p per share and a 12 month life. These warrants carry an accelerator clause whereby, if the 10 day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is above 1.5p per share for 10 consecutive days, then the holder must either exercise the warrant or it becomes void. Any net cash sums raised in the Placing will be netted on a pro rata basis against the loan capital to be drawn, reducing the total loan commitment.\nBoard Participation in Equity Raise\nIllustrating their belief in Bluebird's materially undervalued status, the current Board and other advisors are converting their total fee accruals into equity on the same terms as the Placing, full details of which will be announced in the results of the Placing and the associated equity issuance.\nLoan Terms\nThe Loan will be disbursed in 12 equal monthly tranches commencing on 10 October 2024. It will mature on 1 Dec 2025 (the Repayment Date), carry a fixed coupon of 15% on each drawn sum and is payable on the Repayment Date.\nAs part of the Loan, 37.5 million warrants (\"Underwriter Warrants\") are being issued by Bluebird to Catalyse and co-investees, the terms being a life of 3 years from 1 October 2024 with an exercise price of 1.5p per share. Should the warrants be exercised in whole or part during the term of the Loan (at the sole discretion of Catalyse and the nominated investees), it is agreed between the Parties and Bluebird that the warrant payment proceeds will not be called for by the Company but shall instead be netted against the repayment of the pro rata drawn Loan.\nBroker Option/Placing participation\nThe Company plans to extend an opportunity to current shareholders, via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (\"WRAP\"), to participate in the Placing element of the Funding on the same terms as the Board. The Company will provide further details regarding the WRAP offer shortly. Shareholders can also contact the Company's broker Si Capital, whose details are below. Shareholders can view the Company's most recent presentation via the following link.\nhttps://bluebirdmv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Investor-Meet-Presentaion-June-24.pdf\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"Catalyse has been a long-standing supporter of Bluebird and we welcome this loan agreement as a de facto underwriting of the current equity value, to provide ongoing working capital. The loan structure allows for us to receive capital without having to utilise the equity capital markets, where we believe a potential funding would be at a significant discount to the current price and therefore unnecessarily dilutive. Furthermore, we believe that the current share price is presently not reflecting the material progress we have made in recent months.

Local contractors have visited the area and planning work is being undertaken. The work on refurbishment will satisfy the qualifying spend required for the extension of the Kochang licence in accordance with the mining regulatory authorities in South Korea.\nHaving consulted the Mine Safety Office, the Company believe that they may be able to access the mine for refurbishment before the grant of the Mountain Temporary Use Permit. This remains under review by the Board of Audit and Inspection, but the Company remain confident in a positive outcome.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"The refurbishment of the adit is beneficial in a number of ways. Safe access to the mine will allow us to carry out additional studies and importantly the attributed investment satisfies the spend commitment needed to extend the licence for a further three years. Kochang has a relatively quick path to production through the utilisation of contract mining and toll treatment. The more we can do now, the faster to cashflow. On a wider level, we continue to establish development paths for our other two gold projects and hope to make further announcements in due course re progress.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nNick Emerson SI Capital Tel: 01483413500\nAbout Bluebird\nLondon listed Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd is focused on developing high grade, low capex gold projects.

With committed development capital at the project level, the Company has free carries to production/mine construction on all its projects, which reduces its reliance on the international capital markets.\nBluebird continues to provide technical assistance to these projects, utilising its internationally experienced mining team, which has a track record of bringing gold projects into production across Southeast Asia. Both JV parties recognise each sides competencies and the mutual belief that together they can bring the projects into production and generate significant value for all stakeholders. Importantly the management team has personally invested cUS$2 million into the Company, highlighting their belief in the quality of the portfolio.\nGubong, which was historically the second largest gold mine in South Korea has 9 granted tenements covering c.25 sq km. Gubong is moderately dipping with 9 veins extending 500m below surface and known to extend at least a further 250m. However, the production opportunity for Bluebird prior to looking at deepening the mine is the 25 levels already developed with all the remnants and unmined areas left by the original miners. The 25 levels extend over 120km in total length which indicates the size of the opportunity. The Korea Resources Corporation ('KORES') estimated 2.34M tonnes at some 7.3g/t Au garnered from 57 drill holes over 17,715.3 metres. With additional sampling, mapping, pit modelling and grade analysis, plus the fact that Gubong is an orogenic deposit, which typically have a depth of 2km compared to the current depth of 500m, the Board believe it has a geological potential of 1 million + oz Au in-situ, plus an estimated additional 300,000 oz Au from satellite ore bodies.\nKochang is an epithermal vein deposit with parallel vertical ore bodies covering 8.3 sq km that reportedly produced 110,000 oz of gold and 5.9 million oz of silver between 1961 and 1975.

This provides Bluebird with a free carry to bring the historic mine back into production and organically grow the production profile. The Gubong production profile is estimated at c. 60,000 oz Au, while at the smaller Kochang mine it's 12-15,000 oz Au equivalent per annum.

With a cumulative estimated 1.8M oz Au across three projects, including two historic mines in South Korea and a development project in the Philippines, the Company looks to JV its assets with local partners to provide free carry structures to advance its assets to production.\nBluebird recognised the most effective strategy to develop projects in South Korea and the Philippines involved adopting a Joint Venture model; by securing local partners with in-country operational knowledge and investment capital at the project level, assets can be advanced to production on a de-risked basis.\nThe Company has three JV's providing a cumulative c.US$9m investment: US$5m for the development of the historic Gubong Gold Mine and US$2m for the Kochang Gold and Silver Mine, in South Korea and c.US$2m (funding to a production decision) for the Batangas Gold Project in the Philippines. With committed development capital at the project level, the Company has free carries to production/mine construction on all its projects, which reduces its reliance on the international capital markets.\nBluebird continues to provide technical assistance to these projects, utilising its internationally experienced mining team, which has a track record of bringing gold projects into production across Southeast Asia. Both JV parties recognise each sides competencies and the mutual belief that together they can bring the projects into production and generate significant value for all stakeholders. Importantly the management team has personally invested cUS$2 million into the Company, highlighting their belief in the quality of the portfolio.\nGubong, which was historically the second largest gold mine in South Korea has 9 granted tenements covering c.25 sq km. Gubong is moderately dipping with 9 veins extending 500m below surface and known to extend at least a further 250m. However, the production opportunity for Bluebird prior to looking at deepening the mine is the 25 levels already developed with all the remnants and unmined areas left by the original miners. The 25 levels extend over 120km in total length which indicates the size of the opportunity. The Korea Resources Corporation ('KORES') estimated 2.34M tonnes at some 7.3g/t Au garnered from 57 drill holes over 17,715.3 metres. With additional sampling, mapping, pit modelling and grade analysis, plus the fact that Gubong is an orogenic deposit, which typically have a depth of 2km compared to the current depth of 500m, the Board believe it has a geological potential of 1 million + oz Au in-situ, plus an estimated additional 300,000 oz Au from satellite ore bodies.\nKochang is an epithermal vein deposit with parallel vertical ore bodies covering 8.3 sq km that reportedly produced 110,000 oz of gold and 5.9 million oz of silver between 1961 and 1975. Consisting of a gold and silver mine, there are currently four main veins and several parallel subsidiary veins vein which have been identified, as well as a newly identified cross-cutting vein. Historic drilling indicates the veins continue to depth below the current 150m mine and mapping shows the veins on surface providing potential above and below the old workings. The veins extend to the NE providing a strike length of 2.5km with 600m between the two mines not exploited. There is potential to expand operations to the southwest/northeast and to depth, as well as exploit the already mined areas. The total resource potential is between 550,000 and 700,000 tonnes, with a range of grades between 5.2 g/t to 6.6 g/t gold, and 27.3 g/t to 34.8 g/t silver. Following the granting of a Mountain Use permit, there is an estimated 6-to-9-month development time to trial mining.\nBatangas is a 1,160-hectare licence with a 25-year Mineral Production Sharing Agreement ('MPSA') granted. The Project has a current JORC compliant resource of 440,000 ounces, including a maiden ore reserve of 128,000 ounces (including silver credits) as well as multiple additional targets providing extensive resource upside.

This is the final JV structure to be implemented in the Company's portfolio, providing a free carry on all three of our high-grade projects. Funding is crucial for junior resource companies and the fact that we have managed to secure c.US$9 million to develop our cumulative estimated 1.8m oz Au, is truly exciting for all stakeholders as we look to bring our portfolio into production.\n\"Kochang has significant historic data and a non JORC estimate 550-700Kt grading between 5.2-6.6 g/t Au and 27.3-34.8 g/t Ag and its 2.5km strike is open at depth and laterally. Once the MTUP has been secured, the intention is to fast track the Project to production at c.12-15koz Au pa, with trial mining expected to take between 6-to-9 months via processing ore in another Korean facility, providing cash flow for all parties. Importantly, local contractors have already been contacted to provide quotations to undertake work to rehabilitate the Kochang adit to safely prepare for commercial operations. This action is supported by our local partners.\n\"These are exciting times for all stakeholders. We have three exciting projects, local partners and JV funding in place, defined development paths, a lean structure and a highly positive gold price environment. I look forward to regularly updating all shareholders as we develop our multi project precious metal portfolio, as we look to become a producing entity with a cumulative production target in excess of 100,000 oz Au per annum.\"\nDetails\nKochang is recognised as the easier of Bluebird's two projects in South Korea to bring into production. It is an 8.3 sq km epithermal high grade vein deposit with a c.2.5km strike of which 600m between the two mines has not been exploited. It produced c.110,000 oz Au (19.6g/t) and 5.9Moz Ag (1,000g/t) from 1961-1975 and has a Non JORC estimate 550-700Kt, grading between 5.2-6.6 g/t Au and 27.3-34.8 g/t Ag. The team has an estimated production target of c.10-15koz pa and believes there is significant potential to expand operations laterally and at depth as well as exploit already mined areas.\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the South Korean's will form an SPV for the investment that will facilitate Kochang's development,\ninvesting up to US$2 million in return for a maximum 60% of the Project\n. The South Korean J\nV partner already has a JV agreement with the Company to invest US$5 million for the development of Gubong (see RNS dated 07.05.",

Jonathan Morley-Kirk remains as Non-executive Chairman while Colin Patterson will move to Non-executive Director. Aidan Bishop, who was instrumental in signing the JVs with the Company's South Korean and Filipino partners, will move to interim CEO.\nThe Company has adopted a JV business model to mitigate project risks and reduce development obligations while retaining exposure to its high-grade gold assets. In this model, local partners contribute capital and local expertise, while Bluebird offers a deep knowledge that encompasses all aspects of mining. This structure guarantees that each asset follows its optimal development path.\nIn line with this, the Company has reduced its Board to better reflect its advisory/consultancy obligations to the JVs and lower its corporate overheads. Additionally, Bluebird aims to change its name whilst retaining its ticker; further details will be provided in the upcoming Notice of AGM.\nIn South Korea, the Gubong project, with an estimated 1.3 million ounces of gold, is being advanced to production with a consortium of South Korean businessmen investing US$5 million to acquire up to 60% ownership. In the Philippines, the Company has a JV with a local partner who brings decades of mining experience and is investing approximately US$2 million to secure 60% ownership of Batangas and provide Bluebird with a free carry to mine construction. The Board is currently exploring a similar structure for its Kochang Gold & Silver Project, also in South Korea, and hopes to provide further details soon.\nBluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said,\n\"\nI would like to start by thanking Charlie, who has spent five decades in the mining industry, for his dedication to Bluebird, and\nClive, who has spent nigh on 50 years of active involvement in the City, for his invaluable contribution to the Company. Their corporate and technical experience has been instrumental in developing our exciting high-grade gold portfolio and we wish them every success in their future endeavours. I would also like to thank Colin for his unwavering stewardship and am delighted that he will continue to offer his technical insights in his new role as a Non-executive Director.\n\"We look forward to working with our JV partners to develop the Gubong and Batangas gold projects. The new structure of the project companies means that the local investors in each provide finance, which is a cumulative c. US$7 million, management and as well as corporate and planning expertise at local, district and governmental levels, while Bluebird provides billable consultancy and technical expertise. Accordingly, a slimline Board better reflects the input needed by Bluebird while enabling us to reduce our corporate overheads.\n\"We are already seeing positive outcomes from this new arrangement and aim to replicate the strategy at our second project in South Korea, Kochang. In this regard, our project manager, Graeme Fulton, a mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience, and I met with our prospective partners last week and agreements are now in the final drafting stage.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nNick Emerson SI Capital Tel: 01483413500\nAbout Bluebird\nBluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd (BMV.L) is a London listed South Korea-focused resources company centred on bringing historically producing gold mines back into production.

Bluebird has implemented a JV model whereby it has identified local partners to invest at the asset level to advance its projects to production. In South Korea, a local consortium is investing US$5 million into Gubong and is negotiating to make an investment into Kochang. The Company also has a JV structure in the Philippines, securing c.US$2m to advance the Lobo underground gold project at Batangas.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add to meet BLUEBIRD MERCHANT VENTURES LTD via:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/bluebird-merchant-ventures-ltd/register-investor\n.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nNick Emerson SI Capital Tel: 01483413500\nAbout Bluebird\nBluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd (BMV.L) is a London listed gold development company. It is led by a team of proven mine rehabilitation experts, and currently has two 100% owned licensed high grade narrow vein mining projects, the Gubong Gold Project ('Gubong') and the Kochang Gold and Silver Project ('Kochang'), which each have a defined route to low cost/ low capex production with a cumulative target of producing 100,000 oz + Au per annum.\nThe management team has invested cUS$2 million personally into the Company and believe, following analysis of historic production and exploration data, as well as extensive sampling, geological, geophysical, and engineering studies, there is potential for in excess of 1.5 million oz of mineable gold in its Korean projects alone.\nGubong, which was historically the second largest gold mine in South Korea has 9 granted tenements covering c.25 sq km. Gubong is moderately dipping with 9 veins extending 500m below surface and known to extend at least a further 250m. However, the production opportunity for Bluebird prior to looking at deepening the mine is the 25 levels already developed with all the remnants and unmined areas left by the original miners. The 25 levels extend over 120km in total length which indicates the size of the opportunity. The Korea Resources Corporation ('KORES') estimated 2.34M tonnes at some 7.3g/t Au garnered from 57 drill holes over 17,715.3 metres. With additional sampling, mapping, pit modelling and grade analysis, plus the fact that Gubong is an orogenic deposit, which typically have a depth of 2km compared to the current depth of 500m, the Board believe it has a geological potential of 1 million + oz Au in-situ, plus an estimated additional 300,000 oz Au from satellite ore bodies.\nKochang is an epithermal vein deposit with parallel vertical ore bodies covering 8.3 sq km that reportedly produced 110,000 oz of gold and 5.9 million oz of silver between 1961 and 1975. Consisting of a gold and silver mine, there are currently four main veins and several parallel subsidiary veins vein which have been identified, as well as a newly identified cross-cutting vein. Historic drilling indicates the veins continue to depth below the current 150m mine and mapping shows the veins on surface providing potential above and below the old workings. The veins extend to the NE providing a strike length of 2.5km with 600m between the two mines not exploited. There is potential to expand operations to the southwest/northeast and to depth, as well as exploit the already mined areas. The total resource potential is between 550,000 and 700,000 tonnes, with a range of grades between 5.2 g/t to 6.6 g/t gold, and 27.3 g/t to 34.8 g/t silver. Following the granting of a Mountain Use permit, there is an estimated 6-to-9-month development time to trial mining.\nAdditionally, the Company has the highly prospective Batangas Gold Exploration Project in the Philippines, where it has an agreement with a Philippine company, whose owners have decades of experience in mining, to develop the Project. The JV covers the entire Batangas Project area, which has a current JORC compliant resource of 440,000 ounces, including a maiden ore reserve of 128,000 ounces (including silver credits).

The two parties discussed the optimal path to advancing the project, the relevant community programmes that need to be initiated and discussed land area for mine access as well as meeting with the relevant local landowner.\nWith regards to Kochang, discussions regarding a potential JV with the same consortium that invested in Gubong are at an advanced stage, and the team is confident of a positive conclusion in the near future with legal drafting underway.\nKochang is recognised as the easier of Bluebird's two projects in South Korea to bring into production. It is an 8.3 sq km epithermal high grade vein deposit with a c.2.5km strike of which 600m between the two mines has not been exploited. It produced c.110,000 oz Au (19.6g/t) and 5.9Moz Ag (1,000g/t) from 1961-1975 and has a Non JORC estimate 550-700Kt, grading between 5.2-6.6 g/t Au and 27.3-34.8 g/t Ag. The team has an estimated production target of c.10-15koz pa and believes there is significant potential to expand operations laterally and at depth as well as exploit already mined areas.\nBluebird CEO Colin Patterson said,\n\"Our recent trip to South Korea was highly successful. Having hit the ground running at Gubong with our new partner, engaging in discussions about development plans, the role of our geological team, and community programmes, we now hope to finalise a similar joint venture for Kochang to secure free carries on all our high-grade gold projects. These are exciting times for Bluebird, and I look forward to sharing further updates in the near future on developments across all three of our projects.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nNick Emerson SI Capital Tel: 01483413500\nAbout Bluebird\nBluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd (BMV.L) is a London listed gold development company.

Under the law, the Company now has a further three-year period to achieve Commercial Operation or make a further 'Qualifying Investment'. Additionally, the Mining Right can be extended for a further 20-year period upon either Commercial Operations having commenced, or the appropriate next Qualifying Investments made.\nWith the new JV partner in place, who are providing Bluebird with a free carry to production, the Company believes that the ability to navigate the South Korean permitting environment and manage local community engagement is greatly enhanced. Gubong was South Korea's second largest producing mine and\nhas a potential resource of +1Moz Au in-situ, plus an estimated additional 300,000 oz Au from satellite ore bodies\n.\nBluebird CEO Colin Patterson said,\n\"The extension of the Permit to Develop for Gubong means that we have maintained the licence integrity.

The work is fully funded by the Company's 's Joint Venture partner and consists of the following studies:\n\u00b7\nFresh Water\n\u00b7\nGround Water\n\u00b7\nMarine Water\n\u00b7\nAmbient\nAir & Noise Quality\n\u00b7\nSoil Quality\n\u00b7\nFlora and Fauna\nTo expedite the work, a team contracted by the recently appointed E-Green Management & Environmental Consultancy Corporation (RNS: 4th March 2024), is establishing sampling and monitoring stations across the Lobo area.\nBluebird CEO Colin Patterson said,\n\"The work programmes on the ground at Lobo for the EIS completion are underway. E-Green are moving quickly as all parties focus on rapidly advancing the Project up the development curve. This work will go toward the submission for an Environmental Compliance Certificate, which together with the Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility are the two key outstanding compliance permissions for the Project to move into the production phase.\n\"Lobo is high-grade with further upside potential where previous trenching yielded results of up to 56.8 g/t Au reported, and the current Indicated resource of 82,000 oz Au, on just one of nine targets, is perceived as easily convertible to reserve category. What is important to note is that the resource numbers were calculated when the gold price was over half of what it is today and therefore a higher cut-off was used. With the potential economics now impacted by the current gold price environment we expect a material upgrade as a lower cut-off is applied. Additionally, t\nhe Lobo licence area has multiple epithermal and high-grade targets already identified for resource expansion with 15km of identified mineralised structures.\n\"So, work is progressing at pace, as we look to advance our high-grade gold projects in the Philippine and South Korea under our free carry JV structures. Shareholders have been patient, something that the Board has appreciated, and recent activity in our equity is beginning to repay them for this. Our portfolio is at an inflexion point in terms of activity and I look forward to updating the market as milestones are achieved.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information please visit https://bluebirdmv.com or contact:\nJonathan Morley-Kirk Bluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd Email:\njmk@bluebirdmv.com\nNick Emerson SI Capital Tel: 01483413500\nAbout Bluebird\nBluebird Merchant Ventures Ltd (BMV.L) is a London listed South Korea-focused resources company centred on bringing historically producing gold mines back into production.

These will inform the decision between progressing development or pursuing an orderly exit. Discussions are progressing with potential partners in respect of the South Korean projects. The Company is also currently looking for other investment opportunities in the mining sector. The Company will have a preference for gold assets but may invest in other projects related to other commodities if the investment was on favourable terms. In particular, the Group is looking to enter streaming and/or royalty arrangements that provide either a stream of gold or a financial return. The Group may also seek to make investments in mining infrastructure assets if the terms were sufficiently attractive. The Company may invest in the transaction directly or through its partner institution.\nThe Company is progressing a balanced set of gold-streaming and gold-linked transactions across Australia, West Africa, Central Asia and Southern Africa. Several of these transactions have the potential to produce early ounces within the next 6-9 months, while others have been targeted as they offer multi-year, expansion-linked growth. The current pipeline consists of a mix of producing assets and scalable long-life deposits. Structures being assessed include senior-secured streams and shorter cycle arrangements, with selective equity participation where this enhances long-term value.\nThe Company will provide further updates as these initiatives advance and key milestones are achieved.\nUpdate on the Placing and Subscription\nOn 18 December 2025 the Company announced a proposed fundraise, subject to regulatory approvals, of a total of \u00a3627,450, before expenses, by way of issue of 418,300,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at 0.15 pence per share. Of the total of the monies raised, \u00a3500,000 was via a placement with CMC Markets UK Plc (\"CMC\"), trading as CapX (\"Placing\") and the balance of \u00a3127,450 was via a subscription by HNW sophisticated investors (\"Subscription\"). The proceeds raised via the Subscription has been amended to \u00a3100,000 from \u00a3127,450 as announced on 18 December 2025.\nThe shares issued pursuant to the Placing and Subscription are expected to admitted to the equity shares (transition) category of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities at 8:00 am on Thursday 22 January 2026.\nWRAP Offer\nThe Company has plans later today to launch an offer of up to 86,666,666 Ordinary Shares at the Placing Price, via the WRAP offer to existing Shareholders. The Company will raise up to \u00a3130,000 from this offer. The details of the WRAP offer will be set out in a separate announcement by the Company.\nTrust Arrangements\nFurther to the announcement on 9 January 2026, the Company announced it had entered into a share incentive trust arrangement pursuant to which Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an entity owned and controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah (as trustee) agreed to subscribe for 650,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company. This arrangement has now been formalised in a Trust Deed dated 16 January 2026 as part the Company's desire to keep its cash burn to a minimum. Under this deed the 650,000,000 ordinary shares allocated for incentive arrangements (\"Trust Shares\") has been split into two parts. Firstly 300,000,000 ordinary shares which may be awarded to employees or former employees, or a spouse, civil partner, surviving spouse, surviving civil partner, minor child or minor step-child of an employees or former employees, directors and former directors of the Company and consultants of the Company (\"Incentive Beneficiaries\"). These awards are to be subject to achieving operational and/or financial milestones including growth in market capitalisation and financial metrics such as profit. These milestones still need to be agreed between the Company and Skylake but if agreement is not reached within three months the Company can buy ",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

ALL PEOPLE NEED TO DO IS CHECK FOR THEMSELVES,ON THE WEBSITE OR PREVIOUS RNS'S From 10th Dec, Update on Existing Gold Interests: Philippines (Batangas) and Korea The Company provides an update on its legacy gold interests in the Philippines and Korea following renewed engagement by the new management team. Both assets are now undergoing structured review and reactivation efforts designed to bring greater clarity, discipline, and value potential into the portfolio. In the Philippines (Batangas), the Company has re-established direct engagement with the local counterparty and begun a comprehensive assessment of the project's development position. Historically held on a passive basis, the asset is now being moved to an active oversight framework. Management and the local partner are working towards a defined 2026-27 development timetable supported by clear reporting and milestone tracking. The intention is to agree a detailed work plan and establish a formal project tracker during Q1 2026, providing the Company with improved visibility over the project's pathway and potential future cashflow. In Korea, the Company has initiated a full reassessment of the project structure and development pathway. Discussions are progressing with potential partners, including the locally engaged group previously associated with BMV, to determine whether a technically capable and well-capitalised local lead party can be put in place. In parallel, a formal legal review of the permitting and appeal position will commence in January 2026. This will provide a definitive understanding of the regulatory basis on which the asset can be advanced and will inform the decision between a development path or an orderly exit. Over the coming months, the Company will focus on establishing clear development options and execution responsibility across both assets. Key milestones include agreement of the Philippines development plan in early Q1 2026",

In the Philippines, that section of the RNS shows that BMV has completely lost touch with where this project is up to. Essentially, the don\u2019t know whether the partner is ploughing along toward production or if the project has just been mothballed. In South Korea, Kochang may not be allowed to get to production due to the permitting issues and Gubong wasn\u2019t even progressed that far due to lack of local support in reopening the mine. Whilst I would like more than anyone for these gold mines to be brought into production as BMV could make a lot of money, investing here in the current position is a huge risk. If I wasn\u2019t already tied-in, it isn\u2019t one I would be  dipping my toe into, unless I really fancied a gamble.",

ALL PEOPLE NEED TO DO IS CHECK FOR THEMSELVES,ON THE WEBSITE OR PREVIOUS RNS'S From 10th Dec, Update on Existing Gold Interests: Philippines (Batangas) and Korea The Company provides an update on its legacy gold interests in the Philippines and Korea following renewed engagement by the new management team. Both assets are now undergoing structured review and reactivation efforts designed to bring greater clarity, discipline, and value potential into the portfolio. In the Philippines (Batangas), the Company has re-established direct engagement with the local counterparty and begun a comprehensive assessment of the project's development position. Historically held on a passive basis, the asset is now being moved to an active oversight framework. Management and the local partner are working towards a defined 2026-27 development timetable supported by clear reporting and milestone tracking. The intention is to agree a detailed work plan and establish a formal project tracker during Q1 2026, providing the Company with improved visibility over the project's pathway and potential future cashflow. In Korea, the Company has initiated a full reassessment of the project structure and development pathway. Discussions are progressing with potential partners, including the locally engaged group previously associated with BMV, to determine whether a technically capable and well-capitalised local lead party can be put in place. In parallel, a formal legal review of the permitting and appeal position will commence in January 2026. This will provide a definitive understanding of the regulatory basis on which the asset can be advanced and will inform the decision between a development path or an orderly exit. Over the coming months, the Company will focus on establishing clear development options and execution responsibility across both assets. Key milestones include agreement of the Philippines development plan in early Q1 2026",

The Project has a current JORC compliant resource of 440,000 ounces, including a maiden ore reserve of 128,000 ounces (including silver credits) as well as multiple additional targets providing extensive resource upside. Exploration expenditure to the tune of c.$20m has already been invested. South Korea, Kochang is an epithermal vein deposit with parallel vertical ore bodies covering 8.3 sq km that reportedly produced 110,000 oz of gold and 5.9 million oz of silver between 1961 and 1975.  Consisting of a gold and silver mine, there are currently four main veins and several parallel subsidiary veins vein which have been identified, as well as a newly identified cross-cutting vein. Historic drilling indicates the veins continue to depth below the current 150m mine and mapping shows the veins on surface providing potential above and below the old workings. The veins extend to the NE providing a strike length of 2.5km with 600m between the two mines not exploited.  There is potential to expand operations to the southwest/northeast and to depth, as well as exploit the already mined areas. The total resource potential is between 550,000 and 700,000 tonnes, with a range of grades between 5.2 g/t to 6.6 g/t gold, and 27.3 g/t to 34.8 g/t silver. Gubong, which was historically the second largest gold mine in South Korea has 9 granted tenements covering c.25 sq km.  Gubong is moderately dipping with 9 veins extending 500m below surface and known to extend at least a further 250m. However, the production opportunity for Bluebird prior to looking at deepening the mine is the 25 levels already developed with all the remnants and unmined areas left by the original miners.  The 25 levels extend over 120km in total length which indicates the size of the opportunity. The Korea Resources Corporation ('KORES') estimated 2.34M tonnes at some 7.3g/t Au garnered from 57 drill holes over 17,715.3 metres.  With additional sampling, mapping, pit modelling and grade analysis, plus the fact that Gubong is an orogenic deposit, which typically have a depth of 2km compared to the current depth of 500m, the Board believe it has a geological potential of 1 million + oz Au in-situ, plus an estimated additional 300,000 oz Au from satellite ore bodies.",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate.

BMV's pivot toward structured streaming, treasury reserves, and digital asset integration positions the company to capitalize on this environment\u2014by aligning with rising gold prices while avoiding the pitfalls of traditional mining. ??",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

Look up Home REIT in news today. Another plc where directors misled the market and raised money from investors based on false information. Sound familiar? Those directors have now found themselves being rudely awaken by a dawn raid courtesy of the SFO. Who knows if that happens here, but that case all started with a FCA report. Good luck.",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate.

Its the fraud mechanism in play and we have now seen through it.

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

Look up Home REIT in news today. Another plc where directors misled the market and raised money from investors based on false information. Sound familiar?

Look up Home REIT in news today. Another plc where directors misled the market and raised money from investors based on false information. Sound familiar? Those directors have now found themselves being rudely awaken by a dawn raid courtesy of the SFO. Who knows if that happens here, but that case all started with a FCA report. Good luck.",

The Company also announces its intention to appoint Frank Amato and Hern\u00e1n M. Yellati as Non-Executive Directors to the Board of Directors.\nThe appointment of Mr Amato and Dr Yellati will be effective immediately following completion of relevant customary due diligence checks by the Company's advisers. A further announcement will be made in due course, including any disclosures required under UK Listing Rule 6.4.8, should they be applicable.\nDirectorate Changes\nFrank Amato will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director, and is a former Executive Director at JPMorgan with 18 years of experience in traditional finance, specialising as a precious metals market maker and derivatives (options) trader. He has been an active angel investor in crypto, Web3, and blockchain since early 2014. His early involvement includes purchasing Bitcoin through the U.S. Marshals Service Silk Road auction via SecondMarket, serving as a pre-seed investor in BitMEX, and participating as an early member of Blockchain Capital's AngelList syndicate (including investments in Blockstream, Ripple Labs, and Tierion). Frank also serves as a fintech advisor to the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and as a trading and derivatives consultant to Sovereign AI (Nasdaq: SVRN).\nHern\u00e1n M. Yellati, PhD, will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director. Hern\u00e1n is an accomplished economist with more than 20 years of experience spanning banking, macroeconomics, econometrics, and emerging technologies including crypto, Web3, and blockchain. He is currently Partner and Global Head of Macroeconomic Research and Strategy at Borderless Capital, a leading digital asset investment firm based in Miami.

Hern\u00e1n is a frequent speaker at global conferences and a contributor to major financial media, including Bloomberg and the Financial Times.\nBoard Advisory Committee\nIn line with its new strategy, BMV has also formed a new Board Advisory Committee (\"the Committee\"). The Committee has been established to provide independent, specialist advice to the Board across mining operations, financial strategy, and governance matters. The Committee will support informed decision-making on capital allocation, regulatory compliance, and risk management, drawing on deep industry and financial expertise to strengthen oversight and long-term value creation.\nThe initial members of the Committee will comprise:\n1. Paul Ray, CEO of Raptor Capital International. Paul is a seasoned surveyor with nearly 50 years of experience in the global mining and exploration industry. He has held senior roles at major organisations including Theiss Bros and Placer Exploration and Development Corporation.

This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ?

Look up Home REIT in news today. Another plc where directors misled the market and raised money from investors based on false information. Sound familiar? Those directors have now found themselves being rudely awaken by a dawn raid courtesy of the SFO. Who knows if that happens here, but that case all started with a FCA report. Good luck.",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate.

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

          "content": "Bluebird Executive Director and Interim CEO Aidan Bishop said, \"I am very pleased with the progress of discussions in the Philippines which are looking very positive and will enable, if successfully completed, Bluebird to maintain an ongoing exposure with zero future cash commitments. On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I was also advised that there have been other investors concerns regarding the company itself and one should be re assured that it is a bonfide public listed company and if anyone has any concerns to contact Grace Church direct. I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

The new appointed directors seem to be very good ay what they do and with Ray coming on board the BMV outfit - even as an advisor - makes this a very interesting proposition now. I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ?

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future.

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

Its incredible that this is allowed to happen and it's such a transparent fraud of investor money. This Sath needs to be in prison for everything he has done and I believe it was intentional to line his own pockets through his empty fraudulent ltd companies This is a shambles and a mockery of the Financial Markets His lies and constant change of plan and words should be be due an instant disqualification of his position and he should be barred from ever becoming a director again of any company Total fraud and corruption",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

Over the course of our discussions, it was evident that the scale of his ambition with regards to building out the potential for Bluebird is precisely what the Company requires as it continues to focus and evolve its unique new trajectory. This initial funding to buy Bitcoin is also on great terms for shareholders evidencing Sath's confidence in the current underlying asset base and the future strategy. The Company is moving as quickly as possible to capture the opportunity from the enthusiasm surrounding 'digital gold'. I believe that we are still very early in the cycle and despite market volatility we are positioning to capture upside for our shareholders. I look forward to updating the market in near term with continued major catalysts to drive the continued re-rating and market evaluation of the Company and its prospects\" Yes, so he can now play the same game by making you all money via Deception and pull in the mugs to buy into garbage What a  CON No more as you have all been found out and we are watching your moves very carefully",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ?

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price.

The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives.

Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises.

In my view, the company remains uninvestable. It has no meaningful cash to support the gold\u2011streaming strategy it keeps promoting, and the recently appointed non\u2011executive directors appear to add little beyond an attempt to create the impression of credibility. As someone who has personally lost money due to what I believe has been a pattern of misleading communication, I cannot in good conscience encourage anyone to invest further. People deserve transparency, and right now I don\u2019t see it.",

I had a good read of their prospectus issued by the FCA and it is very detailed and mentions the trust plan quite clearly and it's uses etc! The new guys he has sourced are of good pedigree and it was needed to remove the spot light from him. If i was a betting man - i would bet on the team he has (if you still believe in his $1 Bill Mcap. i've been burnt here and got my lessons - will i return - i have no idea - let the next updates tell more as to what is on the offering. At the current share price and the potential to multi bag at any positive news - it certainly looks interesting. You've made my head spin a bit Frankie - Good weekend to all Shrewdie",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

He mentioned that Sath is really excited and hungry, like Henry Ford and has got what he wanted to ensure his 1 billion Mcap goal I am tempted to buy back but will hold out until there is an RNS update to confirm the way forward GL",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

There was a lot more that I discussed with Alexa at Grace church and he is advised me that the strategy was changed due to the changing events unfolding around the globe and that the new appointments were bought in by Sath to reach his milestone of 1 billion Mcap I don't really care about Sath I'm actually now interested in the new non executive directors and the CEO of Raptor Gracechurch has also advised that the main focus is in getting the SP up again as now the prospectus saga is completed and the new team players have come on board. He mentioned that Sath is really excited and hungry, like Henry Ford and has got what he wanted to ensure his 1 billion Mcap goal I am tempted to buy back but will hold out until there is an RNS update to confirm the way forward GL",

I was also advised that there have been other investors concerns regarding the company itself and one should be re assured that it is a bonfide public listed company and if anyone has any concerns to contact Grace Church direct. I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ?

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level.

He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada.

Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy.

Risks: The stock has shown severe underperformance compared to the FTSE All-Share Index and carries a \"Hold\" or speculative recommendation based on its restructuring. Factors Influencing Future Price: Gold Streaming Strategy: Success depends on the implementation of their new, gold-focused streaming and treasury model. Funding & Capital: The recent 2026 equity raise aims to stabilize the balance sheet, which was previously severely strained. Management Goals: The company is focusing on \"digital and real gold plans\" and potential monetization of older, legacy assets.",

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment. Long-Term Focus: Institutions often hold these positions for over three years as part of a long-term strategy to gain exposure to gold while avoiding the high capital expenditures and operational risks of direct mining. Institutional Players The market is dominated by large players like Franco-Nevada, Royal Gold, and Sandstorm, alongside major institutional investors seeking to add \"safer\" gold exposure compared to direct equity. Recent Trends Basel III Impact: The classification of allocated physical gold as a Tier 1 High-Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) has reinforced institutional interest in gold. Increased Activity: Increased deployment is expected, particularly as miners look to secure capital for development and expansion during tim",

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment. Long-Term Focus: Institutions often hold these positions for over three years as part of a long-term strategy to gain exposure to gold while avoiding the high capital expenditures and operational risks of direct mining. Institutional Players The market is dominated by large players like Franco-Nevada, Royal Gold, and Sandstorm, alongside major institutional investors seeking to add \"safer\" gold exposure compared to direct equity. Recent Trends Basel III Impact: The classification of allocated physical gold as a Tier 1 High-Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) has reinforced institutional interest in gold. Increased Activity: Increased deployment is expected, particularly as miners look to secure capital for development and expansion during tim",

The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ?

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive. Based on my own experience and losses, I cannot recommend anyone put their money into this.",

The new guys he has sourced are of good pedigree and it was needed to remove the spot light from him.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy.

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

The fear of missing out on what can be explosive share price action in the days ahead. Just need the right news inbound now.

Risks: The stock has shown severe underperformance compared to the FTSE All-Share Index and carries a \"Hold\" or speculative recommendation based on its restructuring.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc!

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc!

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price.

Once a pipeline of producing assets is identified a projection of value might be possible and the share price can go up. At the moment all the punter can see is the machinations amongst the executive suite dividing up the pie.  Still no pie.  I'm watching not investing at the moment.",

The St. Albans-based firm crossed below the notification threshold on January 22, with the mining company being informed the following day. The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights). Looks like they have been offloading of late Once they are out and issued shares are bought up and the newsflow kicks in then could be fireworks here at long last Shrewdie",

The new appointed directors seem to be very good ay what they do and with Ray coming on board the BMV outfit - even as an advisor - makes this a very interesting proposition now. I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives.

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future.

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\".

Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings.

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

The fear of missing out on what can be explosive share price action in the days ahead. Just need the right news inbound now. GL As of February 2026, Bluebird Mining Ventures (LON:BMV) is classified as a high-risk \"Value Trap\" with a heavily depressed share price, recently trading around 0.15p, significantly below its 200-day moving average. Analysts have provided highly optimistic, yet speculative, 12-month target prices ranging from 8.66p to 9p. Key Forecasts and Data (as of Feb 2026): Share Price: Trading at approximately 0.15p. 12-Month Target: Highly speculative consensus targets range from 8.66p to 9p, suggesting extreme upside potential if the company's new strategy succeeds.

Risks: The stock has shown severe underperformance compared to the FTSE All-Share Index and carries a \"Hold\" or speculative recommendation based on its restructuring. Factors Influencing Future Price: Gold Streaming Strategy: Success depends on the implementation of their new, gold-focused streaming and treasury model. Funding & Capital: The recent 2026 equity raise aims to stabilize the balance sheet, which was previously severely strained. Management Goals: The company is focusing on \"digital and real gold plans\" and potential monetization of older, legacy assets.",

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc!

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ?

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price.

The St. Albans-based firm crossed below the notification threshold on January 22, with the mining company being informed the following day. The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

The new appointed directors seem to be very good ay what they do and with Ray coming on board the BMV outfit - even as an advisor - makes this a very interesting proposition now. I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ?

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ?

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

The Company is moving as quickly as possible to capture the opportunity from the enthusiasm surrounding 'digital gold'.

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently.

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies).

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ?

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price.

The St. Albans-based firm crossed below the notification threshold on January 22, with the mining company being informed the following day. The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

The new appointed directors seem to be very good ay what they do and with Ray coming on board the BMV outfit - even as an advisor - makes this a very interesting proposition now. I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ?

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation.

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

This initial funding to buy Bitcoin is also on great terms for shareholders evidencing Sath's confidence in the current underlying asset base and the future strategy. The Company is moving as quickly as possible to capture the opportunity from the enthusiasm surrounding 'digital gold'. I believe that we are still very early in the cycle and despite market volatility we are positioning to capture upside for our shareholders.

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT.

They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc!

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ?

Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price.

The St. Albans-based firm crossed below the notification threshold on January 22, with the mining company being informed the following day. The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

(it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ? I hoping above 0025p Shrewdie",

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

This is too obvious now He has bought in these new appointments and no one has a foggiest as to what their remuneration packages will be as they are Free Lancers waiting to scalp any free money by being advisors and they are all based in their own locations, not even sharing office space etc! This really has been a fraud from day 1 and still the FSA allow these games to be played Should be suspended ASAP pending investigation and clarification of the CEO He keeps doing it Every single RNS to date has been a disaster Who would want to invest in this ? If you like losing your money....I rather donate it to worthy cause and not in a false and deceptive organisation Sath has a very bad reputation within the city already and he is going to hide behind the scenes with your cash and put a front man in place That's his next sly move GL",

Its incredible that this is allowed to happen and it's such a transparent fraud of investor money. This Sath needs to be in prison for everything he has done and I believe it was intentional to line his own pockets through his empty fraudulent ltd companies This is a shambles and a mockery of the Financial Markets His lies and constant change of plan and words should be be due an instant disqualification of his position and he should be barred from ever becoming a director again of any company Total fraud and corruption",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

Over the course of our discussions, it was evident that the scale of his ambition with regards to building out the potential for Bluebird is precisely what the Company requires as it continues to focus and evolve its unique new trajectory. This initial funding to buy Bitcoin is also on great terms for shareholders evidencing Sath's confidence in the current underlying asset base and the future strategy. The Company is moving as quickly as possible to capture the opportunity from the enthusiasm surrounding 'digital gold'. I believe that we are still very early in the cycle and despite market volatility we are positioning to capture upside for our shareholders. I look forward to updating the market in near term with continued major catalysts to drive the continued re-rating and market evaluation of the Company and its prospects\" Yes, so he can now play the same game by making you all money via Deception and pull in the mugs to buy into garbage What a  CON No more as you have all been found out and we are watching your moves very carefully",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

          "content": "Crypto faces immediate industry consolidation as market downturn exposes weak business models, according to Bullish CEO Tom Farley. Bitcoin's 45% decline from its October 2025 peak of $126,100 to approximately $69,400 is accelerating a shakeout that should have occurred years earlier. Farley, who previously served as president of the New York Stock Exchange, told CNBC that inflated valuations kept unrealistic expectations alive until now. \"The same thing is going to happen starting right now in crypto,\" Farley said during his Friday interview. He witnessed similar consolidation patterns in the exchange sector during his NYSE tenure. Companies with $10 million in revenue and no growth were still demanding $200 million valuations, according to Farley. That era of over-optimistic pricing is ending as the market correction washes away what he called \"false optimism.\" \"People are going to realize they don't have businesses, they have products, and they need to merge up, and they need to scale, and that is going to happen,\" Farley said. The consolidation should have started one to two years ago but was delayed by unrealistic 2020-era valuation expectations. The process will involve larger companies acquiring smaller, underperforming projects across the crypto market. This absorption will likely lead to significant layoffs, internal reorganizations, and industry-wide restructuring. Venture capital firms have already become more selective with crypto investments as the market matures. Investment decisions now focus on scalable, sustainable projects rather than speculative ventures, according to industry sources. Farley believes surviving companies must transition from being \"features\" to becoming \"institutional, compliant, and respected.\" The shift represents a move away from what he described as \"chasing frog coins and 100x use\" toward more substantial on-chain finance. Even traditional financial institutions like the NYSE have shown interest in blockchain systems for stock trading, suggesting the underlying technology has staying power despite individual project failures. This institutional endorsement indicates blockchain infrastructure is becoming a fixture of modern global finance. The current market downturn acts as a filter, forcing companies to prove long-term viability to attract buyers or survive independently. The result will likely be a crypto industry that resembles traditional finance, with a handful of large, heavily regulated companies providing most infrastructure. For firms that adapt during this transition, consolidation offers a chance to become legitimate long-term players in what Farley sees as an increasingly professional global market. The transformation marks the end of what he characterized as the industry's \"wild west\" phase.

          "content": "As of early February 2026, Bluebird Mining Ventures (BMV) is trading at approximately 0.15p, with analysts offering highly speculative, long-term targets ranging from 8.66p to 9p. Following a shift to a gold streaming and treasury model and recent equity raises, the stock is considered high-risk with potential for extreme upside if new strategies succeed. Key 2026 Projections and Outlook Target Price: Consensus suggests a long-term target around 8.66p\u20139p, representing a massive potential increase from current levels, though this is deemed highly speculative. Operational Shift: The company has pivoted towards a \"next-generation gold streaming and treasury platform,\" focusing on income-producing, physical asset-backed instruments rather than direct mine ownership. Market Context: The share price has experienced significant volatility, trading in a 52-week range of 0.12p to 1.66p, with recent interest driven by potential synergies between gold and digital assets. Risk Factors: The stock carries significant risk, with a recent EPS forecast of -$0.07. The company has also faced potential for shareholder dilution. Conclusion Investors are looking at the 2026 strategy to determine if it can deliver on its high-value, long-term projections. Given the low, volatile share price, it is considered a high-risk, high-reward, speculative investment rather than a stable",

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

Since the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment. Long-Term Focus: Institutions often hold these positions for over three years as part of a long-term strategy to gain exposure to gold while avoiding the high capital expenditures and operational risks of direct mining. Institutional Players The market is dominated by large players like Franco-Nevada, Royal Gold, and Sandstorm, alongside major institutional investors seeking to add \"safer\" gold exposure compared to direct equity. Recent Trends Basel III Impact: The classification of allocated physical gold as a Tier 1 High-Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) has reinforced institutional interest in gold. Increased Activity: Increased deployment is expected, particularly as miners look to secure capital for development and expansion during tim",

The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ?

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive. Based on my own experience and losses, I cannot recommend anyone put their money into this.",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I was also advised that there have been other investors concerns regarding the company itself and one should be re assured that it is a bonfide public listed company and if anyone has any concerns to contact Grace Church direct. I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

On a personal level, I embarked some time ago on a journey to understand and learn about bitcoin. I am convinced that we are witnessing a tectonic shift in global markets and that bitcoin will reshape the landscape of financial markets on every level. By adopting a 'gold plus a digital gold' strategy, it offers the Company an opportunity to turn the page and look to the future and seek to attract a new type of shareholder. Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

          "content": "Crypto faces immediate industry consolidation as market downturn exposes weak business models, according to Bullish CEO Tom Farley. Bitcoin's 45% decline from its October 2025 peak of $126,100 to approximately $69,400 is accelerating a shakeout that should have occurred years earlier. Farley, who previously served as president of the New York Stock Exchange, told CNBC that inflated valuations kept unrealistic expectations alive until now. \"The same thing is going to happen starting right now in crypto,\" Farley said during his Friday interview. He witnessed similar consolidation patterns in the exchange sector during his NYSE tenure. Companies with $10 million in revenue and no growth were still demanding $200 million valuations, according to Farley. That era of over-optimistic pricing is ending as the market correction washes away what he called \"false optimism.\" \"People are going to realize they don't have businesses, they have products, and they need to merge up, and they need to scale, and that is going to happen,\" Farley said. The consolidation should have started one to two years ago but was delayed by unrealistic 2020-era valuation expectations. The process will involve larger companies acquiring smaller, underperforming projects across the crypto market. This absorption will likely lead to significant layoffs, internal reorganizations, and industry-wide restructuring. Venture capital firms have already become more selective with crypto investments as the market matures. Investment decisions now focus on scalable, sustainable projects rather than speculative ventures, according to industry sources. Farley believes surviving companies must transition from being \"features\" to becoming \"institutional, compliant, and respected.\" The shift represents a move away from what he described as \"chasing frog coins and 100x use\" toward more substantial on-chain finance. Even traditional financial institutions like the NYSE have shown interest in blockchain systems for stock trading, suggesting the underlying technology has staying power despite individual project failures. This institutional endorsement indicates blockchain infrastructure is becoming a fixture of modern global finance. The current market downturn acts as a filter, forcing companies to prove long-term viability to attract buyers or survive independently. The result will likely be a crypto industry that resembles traditional finance, with a handful of large, heavily regulated companies providing most infrastructure. For firms that adapt during this transition, consolidation offers a chance to become legitimate long-term players in what Farley sees as an increasingly professional global market. The transformation marks the end of what he characterized as the industry's \"wild west\" phase.

          "content": "As of early February 2026, Bluebird Mining Ventures (BMV) is trading at approximately 0.15p, with analysts offering highly speculative, long-term targets ranging from 8.66p to 9p. Following a shift to a gold streaming and treasury model and recent equity raises, the stock is considered high-risk with potential for extreme upside if new strategies succeed. Key 2026 Projections and Outlook Target Price: Consensus suggests a long-term target around 8.66p\u20139p, representing a massive potential increase from current levels, though this is deemed highly speculative. Operational Shift: The company has pivoted towards a \"next-generation gold streaming and treasury platform,\" focusing on income-producing, physical asset-backed instruments rather than direct mine ownership. Market Context: The share price has experienced significant volatility, trading in a 52-week range of 0.12p to 1.66p, with recent interest driven by potential synergies between gold and digital assets. Risk Factors: The stock carries significant risk, with a recent EPS forecast of -$0.07. The company has also faced potential for shareholder dilution. Conclusion Investors are looking at the 2026 strategy to determine if it can deliver on its high-value, long-term projections. Given the low, volatile share price, it is considered a high-risk, high-reward, speculative investment rather than a stable",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment. Long-Term Focus: Institutions often hold these positions for over three years as part of a long-term strategy to gain exposure to gold while avoiding the high capital expenditures and operational risks of direct mining. Institutional Players The market is dominated by large players like Franco-Nevada, Royal Gold, and Sandstorm, alongside major institutional investors seeking to add \"safer\" gold exposure compared to direct equity. Recent Trends Basel III Impact: The classification of allocated physical gold as a Tier 1 High-Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) has reinforced institutional interest in gold. Increased Activity: Increased deployment is expected, particularly as miners look to secure capital for development and expansion during tim",

The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ?

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I was also advised that there have been other investors concerns regarding the company itself and one should be re assured that it is a bonfide public listed company and if anyone has any concerns to contact Grace Church direct. I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",

          "content": "Crypto faces immediate industry consolidation as market downturn exposes weak business models, according to Bullish CEO Tom Farley. Bitcoin's 45% decline from its October 2025 peak of $126,100 to approximately $69,400 is accelerating a shakeout that should have occurred years earlier. Farley, who previously served as president of the New York Stock Exchange, told CNBC that inflated valuations kept unrealistic expectations alive until now. \"The same thing is going to happen starting right now in crypto,\" Farley said during his Friday interview. He witnessed similar consolidation patterns in the exchange sector during his NYSE tenure. Companies with $10 million in revenue and no growth were still demanding $200 million valuations, according to Farley. That era of over-optimistic pricing is ending as the market correction washes away what he called \"false optimism.\" \"People are going to realize they don't have businesses, they have products, and they need to merge up, and they need to scale, and that is going to happen,\" Farley said. The consolidation should have started one to two years ago but was delayed by unrealistic 2020-era valuation expectations. The process will involve larger companies acquiring smaller, underperforming projects across the crypto market. This absorption will likely lead to significant layoffs, internal reorganizations, and industry-wide restructuring. Venture capital firms have already become more selective with crypto investments as the market matures. Investment decisions now focus on scalable, sustainable projects rather than speculative ventures, according to industry sources. Farley believes surviving companies must transition from being \"features\" to becoming \"institutional, compliant, and respected.\" The shift represents a move away from what he described as \"chasing frog coins and 100x use\" toward more substantial on-chain finance. Even traditional financial institutions like the NYSE have shown interest in blockchain systems for stock trading, suggesting the underlying technology has staying power despite individual project failures. This institutional endorsement indicates blockchain infrastructure is becoming a fixture of modern global finance. The current market downturn acts as a filter, forcing companies to prove long-term viability to attract buyers or survive independently. The result will likely be a crypto industry that resembles traditional finance, with a handful of large, heavily regulated companies providing most infrastructure. For firms that adapt during this transition, consolidation offers a chance to become legitimate long-term players in what Farley sees as an increasingly professional global market. The transformation marks the end of what he characterized as the industry's \"wild west\" phase.

          "content": "As of early February 2026, Bluebird Mining Ventures (BMV) is trading at approximately 0.15p, with analysts offering highly speculative, long-term targets ranging from 8.66p to 9p. Following a shift to a gold streaming and treasury model and recent equity raises, the stock is considered high-risk with potential for extreme upside if new strategies succeed. Key 2026 Projections and Outlook Target Price: Consensus suggests a long-term target around 8.66p\u20139p, representing a massive potential increase from current levels, though this is deemed highly speculative. Operational Shift: The company has pivoted towards a \"next-generation gold streaming and treasury platform,\" focusing on income-producing, physical asset-backed instruments rather than direct mine ownership. Market Context: The share price has experienced significant volatility, trading in a 52-week range of 0.12p to 1.66p, with recent interest driven by potential synergies between gold and digital assets. Risk Factors: The stock carries significant risk, with a recent EPS forecast of -$0.07. The company has also faced potential for shareholder dilution. Conclusion Investors are looking at the 2026 strategy to determine if it can deliver on its high-value, long-term projections. Given the low, volatile share price, it is considered a high-risk, high-reward, speculative investment rather than a stable",

This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats. The Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.",

          "content": "The convergence of gold streaming/mining and Bitcoin treasury strategies has emerged as a significant trend, with companies aiming to blend the \"old safe haven\" (physical gold) with \"digital gold\" (Bitcoin) to diversify reserves and hedge against inflation. This \"hybrid\" approach is gaining traction among resource developers and investment firms, particularly in the UK and through major stablecoin issuers. Key Players and Developments (As of early 2026): Tether: The stablecoin giant has aggressively moved into this space, holding over $300 million in gold royalty stocks by late 2025, including stakes in Elemental Altus Royalties, Versamet Royalties, and Metalla Royalty & Streaming. Tether also holds substantial gold reserves, with estimates reaching 80\u2013116 metric tonnes, often utilizing its digital gold product XAUT. Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd: A key player merging these strategies, Bluebird is a gold development company that has recently focused on \"marrying its existing mining projects and expertise with the future that is 'digital gold' aka bitcoin\". They are working on gold-streaming projects in Asia and Africa while investing in Bitcoin mining. Mendell Helium PLC: This company announced it is adopting a bitcoin treasury management policy and plans to use a loan facility secured by its bitcoin holdings to finance the acquisition of the Pick Lake deposit in Ontario, illustrating a direct link between bitcoin holdings and physical asset acquisition. Tap Global Group [LON:TAP]: Launched a \"Bitcoin Treasury as a Service\" (BTaaS) to help publicly listed companies, particularly in the UK, manage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, with a focus on institutional-grade security for companies merging digital assets into their strategies. B HODL: A UK-based firm that has established a position as a Bitcoin treasury company, focusing on accumulating Bitcoin while also operating Lightning Network operations. Strategy and Market Context: \"Digital Gold\" Adoption: Similar to the MicroStrategy playbook, these companies often seek to hold Bitcoin as a long-term strategic reserve rather than for immediate cash flow, positioning themselves as future-focused. Diversification: The trend represents a move to diversify treasury holdings beyond just fiat currency, using both gold (for traditional stability) and Bitcoin (for high growth/digital scarcity). Funding Mechanism: Some companies are using Bitcoin loans to fund the acquisition of traditional physical mining assets. Market Position: As of early 2026, the strategy is facing volatility, with some Bitcoin treasury firms seeing their market capitalization drop below the value of their actual Bitcoin holdings. Gold and Bitcoin Correlation: Data from late 2025/early 2026 shows a 0.14 correlation between Bitcoin and gold, indicating that while they are often paired in portfolios, they can move independently. However, both are increasingly viewed as \"debasement trades\"\u2014methods to protect against fiat c",

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment.

          "content": "Institutional-grade deployment in gold streaming refers to the allocation of large-scale, professional capital into mining projects via streaming agreements that meet stringent risk, compliance, and structural standards. These investments are characterized by deep due diligence, secure legal structures, and high-quality counterparties (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, major streaming companies). There are roughly 7760-767 million shares in the free float here You can remove an almost 700 million shares from the discounted share rise as they are held in trust - for employee's /contractors etc! So we only had just over 400 million shares on what was 1.2 billion ? If we get any incoming TR!'s with any big funds buying in (it's a pretty novel treasury platform and 1st mover advantage) expect the shares to be snapped up based on future events This has a potential target of up to As of early 2026, the sector is experiencing increased, \"institutional-grade\" capital deployment, aimed at supporting gold-streaming flows with enhanced control frameworks. Key Characteristics of Institutional-Grade Gold Streaming Asset Quality and Security: Deals are typically focused onTier 1 assets (high-grade, low-cost) with significant mine life, often involving large-scale operations. Rigorous Due Diligence: Institutional-grade deals require independently verified financial statements, rigorous risk controls, and strong governance from the mining operator. Risk Management: Investors use streaming to diversify across multiple mines, reducing exposure to single-asset failure. Structure: These agreements often act as non-dilutive financing for miners, allowing them to monetize by-product gold without giving up equity. Transparency and Compliance: These investments must meet high standards of transparency, with auditing, and legal, and regulatory compliance. Components of Institutional Deployment Upfront Financing: A significant, often upfront payment is made to the miner in exchange for a percentage of future production at a fixed, discounted price. Operational Control: While streaming companies do not operate the mines, they may place restrictions or covenants on the operator to protect the investment. Long-Term Focus: Institutions often hold these positions for over three years as part of a long-term strategy to gain exposure to gold while avoiding the high capital expenditures and operational risks of direct mining. Institutional Players The market is dominated by large players like Franco-Nevada, Royal Gold, and Sandstorm, alongside major institutional investors seeking to add \"safer\" gold exposure compared to direct equity. Recent Trends Basel III Impact: The classification of allocated physical gold as a Tier 1 High-Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) has reinforced institutional interest in gold. Increased Activity: Increased deployment is expected, particularly as miners look to secure capital for development and expansion during tim",

The reduction represents a significant decrease from Spreadex\u2019s previous position of approximately 6.78% of voting rights. According to the TR-1 notification, Spreadex now holds 1.64% of voting rights attached to shares (33,085,036 shares) and 1.81% through financial instruments, primarily CFDs and spread bets (36,465,000 potential voting rights).

I am happy with other open positions and will buy in \u00a310k worth of stock as its a small part of my trading portfolio. (it's free money made wen i made an exit from here) I had a look at recent past RNS's and this caught my eye:- Further to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets. Workstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives. Ok maybe the reason the new ground crew have come on aboard to stabilise a sinking ship at sea with a captain who has lost direction :) I will be busy on other chat boards and may pop in next month to see where we are at ?

If the plan relies on issuing more shares, that simply dilutes existing shareholders to create a structure that seems to benefit the directors rather than the owners. This is not how an investable company behaves. Before introducing schemes like this, the CEO should be able to demonstrate a real product and a credible business model. Right now, all we see are constant restructurings, no cash, no delivery, and endless promises. In my opinion, the pattern is starting to resemble a well\u2011constructed Ponzi\u2011style setup, where new shareholder money is needed just to keep the story alive. Based on my own experience and losses, I cannot recommend anyone put their money into this.",

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far.

          "content": "Several major companies associated with billionaire fortunes have at least 50% of their shares or voting rights held in trusts, foundations, or family-controlled holding companies. These structures are often used to ensure long-term control, manage succession, and handle philanthropic donations. Tata Sons (Tata Group): The promoter holding company of the Tata Group, which controls companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, has approximately 50% or more of its share capital held by two trusts: Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust. Roche Group: Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families hold slightly more than 50% of the voting shares in this Swiss healthcare giant. Robert Bosch GmbH: The German automotive supplier and industrial giant has 92% of its share capital held by Robert Bosch Stiftung GmbH (a charitable foundation). Cargill Inc.: The world's largest privately held company is owned by the Cargill and MacMillan families, who hold roughly 85% of the company, often managed through family trusts. Auchan Group: The French retailing group is controlled by the Mulliez family, who hold roughly 95% of the company. Louis Dreyfus Company: The agricultural commodity company is primarily owned by the Louis-Dreyfus family, who hold approximately 96% of the company. Mars Incorporated: The candy and pet food conglomerate is 100% owned by the Mars family, with management of ownership often tied to trusts. Aldi Group: The Albrecht family controls 100% of the Aldi retail group, split between trusts. Key Takeaways regarding Trust Ownership: Legal Structure: A trust often holds legal ownership of shares for the benefit of family members (beneficiaries). Control vs. Equity: In some cases, such as Roche, the trust may control over 50% of the votes, while holding less than 10% of the total capital. Philanthropic Trusts: Billionaires, including Bill Gates (via the Gates Foundation Trust) and Warren Buffett, use trusts to manage large blocks of company stock (like Berkshire Hathaway) for philanthropic purposes.",

          "content": "A CEO leaving a considerable amount of shares in a trust for employees and their families is typically structured as an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) or an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). This strategy allows the CEO to transition ownership while providing, rewarding, and incentivising staff, often with significant tax advantages. Here is an analysis of this approach based on current practices and regulations: 1. Structure of the Trust Employee Ownership Trust (EOT): A type of EBT where the trust holds a controlling stake (more than 50%) in the company on behalf of all employees. It is often used to ensure the company remains independent and to maintain its culture. Employee Benefit Trust (EBT): A more flexible trust that can be used to hold shares for distribution to specific employees or groups, or to hold shares to satisfy future share options. 2. Benefits to Employees and Families Long-Term Value Creation: Employees benefit from the growth of the company, often receiving dividends or bonuses (up to \u00a33,600 per year per employee, tax-free in the UK, if qualifying conditions are met). No Direct Cost: Employees generally do not have to pay for the shares themselves; the trust holds them on their behalf. Security and Stability: EOTs help in preserving the company's independence and preventing a hostile takeover. Incentivisation: A share in the company\u2019s success acts as a strong motivator for employee engagement and retention. 3. Advantages for the CEO Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Exemption: In the UK, if a controlling interest (more than 50%) is sold to an EOT, the seller can benefit from a 0% capital gains tax rate. Succession Planning: It provides a clean, tax-efficient exit strategy, allowing the CEO to leave behind a stable company. Legacy Preservation: The trust structure keeps the company intact, ensuring the legacy of the founder and the company\u2019s culture continues. 4. Key Considerations and Risks Valuation Requirements: The shares must be sold to the EOT at their full market value, which requires an independent valuation. Funding the Trust: Because the trust often lacks funds, it is common for the seller (CEO) to be paid via a \"vendor loan note,\" where the company uses future profits to pay for the shares over several years. Complex Rules: As of the Autumn Budget 2024, there are stricter rules for EOTs, including limitations on former owners controlling the trust and new residency requirements for trustees. Employee Performance Connection: In a 100% employee-owned company, it can be difficult to differentiate incentives for senior staff compared to the rest of the employees. Real-World Examples John Lewis Partnership: The classic example of a \"John Lewis model,\" where all employees are beneficiaries of the trust. Richer Sounds: The founder transferred controlling ownership to an EOT to reward employees and secure the future. Boosst Financial Planning: The founders sold 100% of their shares to an EOT to protect the",

I was also advised that there have been other investors concerns regarding the company itself and one should be re assured that it is a bonfide public listed company and if anyone has any concerns to contact Grace Church direct. I spoke to Alexa a really nice guy and he listened to all my concerns and was highly understanding towards the past deadlines that were not met and the going back on Saths past promises. I was advised that the prospectus had posed many issues and delays as it has never been done before regarding the novel Treasury platform. I was advised that all the hard work has been done and Sath and team will be doing some interviews soon to update the investor community of what has been achieved so far. The new appointments are of very high calibre and have been bought on board to make Bluebird a 1 billion Mcap company Well this is now refreshing to hear from Grace Church and the FSA GL to all as I just wanted to share this with you all",

Severe Financial Distress - The company was unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due. - Cashflow pressures were significant due to high capital expenditure and operating costs typical of compute\u2011intensive infrastructure businesses. 2. Asset\u2011Heavy Business Model - The company invested heavily in specialised computing hardware and data\u2011centre equipment. - These assets depreciated quickly and required substantial ongoing energy and hosting costs. 3. Funding & Market Conditions - The company had been backed by the UK Government\u2019s Future Fund, indicating it relied on external investment to scale. - Market volatility in energy\u2011intensive computing (including HPC and blockchain\u2011adjacent workloads) likely contributed to instability. What the Administrators Did (Across All Reports) 1. Secured and Realised Assets The administrators: - Took control of the company\u2019s data\u2011centre equipment, servers, and related infrastructure. - Marketed and sold assets where possible to generate returns for creditors. - Managed contracts, leases, and any recoverable receivables. Investigated Company Affairs Standard statutory investigations were carried out, including: \u2022 \tDirector conduct \u2022 \tTransactions prior to insolvency \u2022 \tCreditor claims \u2022 \tContractual obligations No unusual or exceptional findings are mentioned in the filings. Managed Creditor Claims - Preferential, secured, and unsecured creditor classes were identified. - Claims were reviewed and adjudicated. - The reports indicate limited returns for unsecured creditors due to the company\u2019s asset profile. \ud83d\udcb7 Financial Outcome (High\u2011Level) While the filings contain detailed numbers, the combined picture is: - Asset realisations were modest relative to liabilities. - Secured creditors received the majority of recoveries. - Unsecured creditors are expected to receive little or no dividend. - The company had no viable route to rescue, leading to dissolution. \ud83c\udfc1 Final Stage: Move to Dissolution (Jan\u202f2025) The final filing \u2014 Notice of Move from Administration to Dissolution \u2014 confirms: - The administration has achieved its statutory purpose. - No further asset realisations are expected. - The company will be dissolved after the notice period. - This marks the end of the insolvency process. \ud83d\udcda Sources - Companies House filing history for LP Realisations Limited, including: - Administrator\u2019s Pr",

Under the leadership of a new CEO, once identified, it is my sincere hope that Bluebird will finally realise its ambitions for which it was initially established for.\" Sath Ganesarajah, 43, British Sath is a seasoned entrepreneur and investor with deep expertise in crypto assets and institutional capital markets. He first bought Bitcoin in 2017 and has since advised several global hedge funds and institutional investors on crypto strategy, digital asset fund structuring, and large-scale infrastructure deployment-supporting mandates totaling over US$1 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). He is the founder and CEO of The BE Company, a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada. Across multiple ventures, he has developed and operated over 50MW of digital infrastructure, including immersion-cooled compute and modular clean energy projects.  Earlier in his career, Sath held senior trading and structuring roles at Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Credit Suisse, specialising in structured credit and emerging markets. The Board will work together with a view to expediting the appointment of a new CEO by the end of July with several candidates presently in the frame whom will be tasked with spearheading Bluebird's UK first approach of physical Gold + \"digital gold\" investing strategy. Mr Ganesarajah commented:  \"Bluebird has the right ingredients-hard assets, public market access, and a clean slate. My ambition is to help shape Bluebird into a \u00a31 billion company over the coming cycle.\"",
