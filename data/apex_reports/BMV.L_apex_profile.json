This has been done via the issue and allotment of 400,000,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Placing and Subscription, 650,000,000 Ordinary Shares (the \"Trust Shares\") being issued to a trust constituted by a trust deed between the Company and Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\") and 13,151,989 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the WRAP Retail Offer. The Company has advanced a loan of \u00a3968,500 to Skylake in its capacity as trustee of the trust in order for Skylake to fully pay up the Trust Shares on behalf of the trust.\nThe Company is also issuing 46,831,778 Ordinary Shares to certain directors, former directors and consultants in lieu of salary and 40,000,000 to Skylake as consideration due under an acquisition agreement.\nStrengthening Corporate Governance\nAs part of an ongoing commitment to strengthen the Company's corporate governance, BMV has commenced a search for the appointments of additional Non-Executive Directors. These appointments are intended to further align the Board's composition with the Company's growth strategy, ensuring it has an appropriate balance of skills, experience and independence to support the delivery of both the Company's mining projects and its evolving gold streaming and treasury strategy. The Company expects to be in position to announce new appointments during Q1 2026.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued ordinary share capital consists of 2,013,667,471 Ordinary Shares with one voting right each. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, from Admission the total number of Ordinary Shares and voting rights in the Company is 2,013,667,471. This figure may be used by Shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\"We are pleased to complete this fundraise with the support of both new and existing shareholders reflecting confidence in our gold streaming and treasury strategy. The Fundraise will provide the capital required to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and advance a promising pipeline of opportunities with the potential to generate both near-term operational cashflow and longer-term sustainable growth. We look forward to updating the market on our progress as the Company enters the next phase of its development.\"\nTerms used but not defined in this announcement have the same meaning as set out in the Company's announcement released at 16:30 on 16 January 2026.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company.

These will inform the decision between progressing development or pursuing an orderly exit. Discussions are progressing with potential partners in respect of the South Korean projects. The Company is also currently looking for other investment opportunities in the mining sector. The Company will have a preference for gold assets but may invest in other projects related to other commodities if the investment was on favourable terms. In particular, the Group is looking to enter streaming and/or royalty arrangements that provide either a stream of gold or a financial return. The Group may also seek to make investments in mining infrastructure assets if the terms were sufficiently attractive. The Company may invest in the transaction directly or through its partner institution.\nThe Company is progressing a balanced set of gold-streaming and gold-linked transactions across Australia, West Africa, Central Asia and Southern Africa. Several of these transactions have the potential to produce early ounces within the next 6-9 months, while others have been targeted as they offer multi-year, expansion-linked growth. The current pipeline consists of a mix of producing assets and scalable long-life deposits. Structures being assessed include senior-secured streams and shorter cycle arrangements, with selective equity participation where this enhances long-term value.\nThe Company will provide further updates as these initiatives advance and key milestones are achieved.\nUpdate on the Placing and Subscription\nOn 18 December 2025 the Company announced a proposed fundraise, subject to regulatory approvals, of a total of \u00a3627,450, before expenses, by way of issue of 418,300,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at 0.15 pence per share. Of the total of the monies raised, \u00a3500,000 was via a placement with CMC Markets UK Plc (\"CMC\"), trading as CapX (\"Placing\") and the balance of \u00a3127,450 was via a subscription by HNW sophisticated investors (\"Subscription\"). The proceeds raised via the Subscription has been amended to \u00a3100,000 from \u00a3127,450 as announced on 18 December 2025.\nThe shares issued pursuant to the Placing and Subscription are expected to admitted to the equity shares (transition) category of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities at 8:00 am on Thursday 22 January 2026.\nWRAP Offer\nThe Company has plans later today to launch an offer of up to 86,666,666 Ordinary Shares at the Placing Price, via the WRAP offer to existing Shareholders. The Company will raise up to \u00a3130,000 from this offer. The details of the WRAP offer will be set out in a separate announcement by the Company.\nTrust Arrangements\nFurther to the announcement on 9 January 2026, the Company announced it had entered into a share incentive trust arrangement pursuant to which Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an entity owned and controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah (as trustee) agreed to subscribe for 650,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company. This arrangement has now been formalised in a Trust Deed dated 16 January 2026 as part the Company's desire to keep its cash burn to a minimum. Under this deed the 650,000,000 ordinary shares allocated for incentive arrangements (\"Trust Shares\") has been split into two parts. Firstly 300,000,000 ordinary shares which may be awarded to employees or former employees, or a spouse, civil partner, surviving spouse, surviving civil partner, minor child or minor step-child of an employees or former employees, directors and former directors of the Company and consultants of the Company (\"Incentive Beneficiaries\"). These awards are to be subject to achieving operational and/or financial milestones including growth in market capitalisation and financial metrics such as profit. These milestones still need to be agreed between the Company and Skylake but if agreement is not reached within three months the Company can buy these 300,000,000 Trust Shares (\"Incentive Shares\") back for \u00a31. The Company plans to implement an annual maximum of 100,000,000 Incentive Shares. The other 350,000,000 of the Trust Shares can be awarded to a party providing a service to the Company for which they are due a cash sum (\"Contractor Beneficiaries\"), which may include secondees or contractors provided by Skylake. These Ordinary Shares would be awarded in lieu of cash sum from a Company perspective, which should give the Company more cash to further its strategy. Therefore, the Trust Shares are held for the benefit of the Incentive Beneficiaries and the Contractor Beneficiaries (\"Beneficiaries\") rather than the Company as previously announced. The Trust Shares have been subscribed for at the same price as ordinary shares issued under the Placing and the Subscription being \u00a30.0015 per Ordinary Share rather than \u00a30.005 per Ordinary Share as previously announced. As Skylake has only gifted \u00a36,500 to this trust arrangement, this left a balance of \u00a3968,500 from the trust for the Trust Shares which has been advanced by the Company to the trust on an interest free basis and is repayable on demand. It is anticipated that Sath Ganesarajah will be a member of the pool of people eligible for the milestone-based awards of Incentive Shares but will not be one of the Contractor Beneficiaries.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming, mining and treasury company.
