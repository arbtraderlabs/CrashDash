          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 2478O\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n09 January 2026\n9 January 2026\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n(\"BMV or the \"Company\")\nStrategic Update\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd (\"BMV\" or the \"Company\"), the gold streaming and treasury company, provides a further update following its Operational Update announcement of 10 December 2025 and the Capital Reorganisation announcement dated 18 December 2025.\nMarket backdrop and inbound interest\nSince the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats.\nThe Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.\nTechnology partnership with BE\nBMV is pleased to confirm a strategic technology partnership with The BE Company (\"BE\"), an affiliated entity in which the Company's Chief Executive Officer has an interest, pursuant to which BE will act as BMV's recognised technology partner. BE is a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada.\nUnder this arrangement, BE will provide in-kind advisory and development support across:\n\u00b7\nIT security and data management\n\u00b7\nDigital and data-centre infrastructure\n\u00b7\nHosting services and software licensing\n\u00b7\nHigh-performance computing and GPU-based platforms\nThe scope also includes support for research and development activities focused on advanced data-driven analysis and high-performance computing applications for geological and subsurface interpretation. The relationship is expected to support business development initiatives during 2026, with the potential for selective commercialisation later in the year. All intellectual property generated under this arrangement will remain the property of BE. BMV will be granted a non-exclusive licence to deploy such technology within its own operations and client services.\nThe Board emphasises that these technology initiatives are supportive and exploratory, with the Company's primary focus remaining its gold streaming and treasury strategy.\nUpdate on equity arrangements\nFurther to the Company's announcement of 18 December 2025, the Board confirms that the previously announced Management and External Investor Equity Subscription Facility and related incentive proposals will not proceed and are being replaced by a revised equity-based arrangement involving Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an entity owned and controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah. The Company has entered into a share incentive trust arrangement pursuant to which Skylake has agreed to subscribe for 650,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company for an aggregate consideration of \u00a33.25 million on a fully paid basis, with \u00a36,250 payable on issue and the balance payable subject to finalisation of a formal incentive scheme over the next few months. The trust is for the benefit of the Company and includes provision for the return of the shares if the milestones for incentive awards cannot be agreed. Furthermore, Skylake has agreed not to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares whilst they are held on trust for the Company. The share incentive trust arrangement is intended to support the provision of seconded services to the Company in lieu of cash remuneration with flexibility to provide working capital as required.\nThe Board further confirms that the Company has been notified that the previously announced acquisition by Skylake of certain warrants in the Company will not proceed. Discussions remain ongoing and the Company will update the market as appropriate.\nThe Board confirms that, notwithstanding the above, the Company's fully diluted share capital position remains unchanged from that disclosed in the announcement dated 18 December 2025.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer of BMV, said:\n\"The increased level of interest we are seeing reflects a growing convergence between physical gold and modern financial infrastructure. BMV will prioritise partnerships that enhance execution capability without diverting focus from the core business. We remain focused on executing our gold streaming and treasury strategy, maintaining balance-sheet discipline, and progressing selective partnerships that support scalable, compliant growth.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nThe Company encourages all investors to share questions on this announcement via its investor hub:\nhttps://bmvbtc.com/s/aca32f\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company. BMV's mission is to build and manage a gold-backed treasury through streaming agreements, providing investors with exposure to physical gold without the operational risk of mining.\nBMV focuses on streams from producing assets within the ore concentrate to bullion value chain. Its investments secure multi-year flows of gold that can be recycled into new transactions. This model enables scalable exposure to gold without capital expenditure, or execution risks.\nDrawing on its heritage in gold, BMV combines the stability of physical bullion with the benefits of a scalable, disciplined business model. With a focus on prudent capital allocation and treasury management, BMV aims to deliver sustainable, long-term value for shareholders.\nFor more information, please visit: www.bmvbtc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The proceeds are expected to provide working capital and support the Company's transition to its gold-focused strategy.\nCMC acted as the Company's sole placing agent in respect of the Placing. BMV is also pleased to announce that CMC has been appointed as the Company's joint corporate broker.\nAcquisition of Legacy Loans - Related Party Transaction\nTwo legacy loans totalling \u00a3200,000 and due in December 2025 have been acquired by Skylake. Skylake has agreed, in principle, to extend repayment on mutually agreed terms, with no additional interest or penalties. The consolidation of these obligations under an aligned lender is intended to remove near-term liquidity pressure and provide balance-sheet stability while the Company advances its revised strategy.\nThe Board, excluding the interested director, reviewed the transaction under the Company's related-party governance protocols and approved it on the basis that the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.\nManagement and External Investor Equity Subscription Facility\nIn addition, the Company has established a framework for a \u00a33.25 million fixed-price equity subscription facility at 0.50 pence per share.\nKey features include:\n\u00b7\nissuance in tranches at the discretion of the Company\n\u00b7\nparticipation by management, Skylake and selected unconnected investors\n\u00b7\nflexibility in timing and sizing of equity issuance\n\u00b7\nstructuring intended to support orderly capital formation in compliance with applicable Listing Rules and regulatory requirements\nAny equity subscriptions under this framework are conditional and subject to the UK prospectus regime, applicable exemptions and regulatory approvals. There is no guarantee that a prospectus will be published or that any such subscriptions will complete.\nCapital Formation Summary (Indicative)\nThe following issuances are envisaged as part of the broader funding framework, subject to regulatory compliance:\n\u00b7\n418,300,000 shares at 0.15 pence raising \u00a3627,450\n\u00b7\nup to 650,000,000 shares at 0.50 pence under the equity subscription framework\nOn completion of all such issuances, total shares in issue would be 1,931,983,704.\nIntended Capital Reorganisation\nWarrant Cancellation\nSkylake has agreed to acquire two major blocks of deep-discount warrants, comprising more than 80 per cent of warrants exercisable at 0.23 pence, from former significant holders. It is intended that all such warrants acquired by Skylake will be cancelled. The cancellation process is being progressed and, once completed, is expected to remove a long-standing structural overhang and support a simplified capital structure ahead of future institutional engagement.\nSkylake Shareholding\nAs part of the stabilisation and capital-structure actions described above, Skylake expects to acquire up to 100,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company, subject to completion of the relevant transactions. These shares are being acquired in connection with the broader restructuring measures currently underway.\nBalance Sheet Stabilisation\nSubject to completion of the relevant steps, Skylake has agreed to:\n\u00b7\ncancel all deep-discount warrants acquired by it\n\u00b7\nextend the assigned legacy loans on mutually agreed terms with no additional interest or penalties\n\u00b7\nsupport the funding framework described below\nTermination of Previous Line of Credit\nThe Company and Skylake have agreed to terminate the former line-of-credit facility. That facility was structured for a discontinued digital-asset strategy and is no longer aligned with the Company's regulated gold-streaming and treasury focus.\nRegulatory Position and Prospectus\nThe Company is admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange Main Market. All transactions, arrangements and initiatives referred to in this announcement, including any proposed equity subscriptions, facilities, placements or issuances of ordinary shares, are subject to the UK prospectus regime, applicable exemptions, shareholder authorities and all relevant regulatory requirements.\nThere can be no certainty that a prospectus will be published or approved, or that any of the transactions described in this announcement will proceed, in whole or in part.\nBoth the Company and potential subscribers note that, following changes to the UK listing framework effective from 19 January, Main Market issuers have increased flexibility in relation to further issuances of shares under their existing listing arrangements. Any use of that flexibility by the Company will remain conditional on compliance with the prospectus regime, applicable exemptions and regulatory approvals.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer of BMV, said:\n\"This fundraise and the capital reorganisation will give BMV a stronger foundation to advance its growth strategy. With legacy instruments being addressed, near-term liabilities stabilised and a structured funding framework being implemented, the Company is progressing towards execution of its gold-streaming and regulated treasury strategy, with the objective of generating long-term exposure to physical gold in a disciplined and compliant manner.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nThe Company encourages all investors to share questions on this announcement via its investor hub:\nhttps://bmvbtc.com/s/aca32f\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company.

          "release_time": "7:00 am",

          "content": "10 Dec 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 9100K\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n10 December 2025\n10 December 2025\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n(\"BMV or the \"Company\")\nOperational Update\nFurther to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets.\nWorkstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives.\nGold-Streaming and Treasury Platform Development\nBMV is progressing a balanced set of gold-streaming and gold-linked transactions across Australia, West Africa, Central Asia and Southern Africa. These opportunities span producing sites, expansion-ready projects and modular processing operations. The portfolio has been designed to balance short-duration cash-impact with longer-life reserve exposure, consistent with BMV's focus on recurring gold flows rather than ownership of mining operations.\nThe transactions under development share common features:\n\u2022 near-term operational cashflow, in several cases from early 2026\n\u2022 structures ranging from senior-secured streams to rolling short-cycle arrangements\n\u2022 exposure to both stable producing assets and scalable long-life deposits\n\u2022 optional equity participation where it strengthens long-term returns\n\u2022 multi-year visibility on gold deliveries, with scope to recycle flows into future streams\nThe Directors believe that collectively, these transactions have the potential for material contribution to the Company's gold-backed treasury in the short-to-mid term. Several of these transactions have the potential to produce early ounces within the next 6-9 months, while others have been targeted as they offer multi-year, expansion-linked growth.\nBTC-Linked Opportunities\nTo complement the gold-streaming platform with optionality in settlement, liquidity and yield - while maintaining the Company's core focus on physical-gold reserves - BMV is assessing a limited number of BTC-linked opportunities within the permitted scope of its treasury operations. Any such exposure is expected to be structured through streaming or BTC-linked arrangements, with cashflows either converted into gold or retained within treasury.\nThe Company will progress and execute any BTC-linked arrangements with full consideration of the applicable class-test thresholds under the Listing Rules, ensuring that any transaction remains within the appropriate regulatory parameters.\nUpdate on Existing Gold Interests: Philippines (Batangas) and Korea\nThe Company provides an update on its legacy gold interests in the Philippines and Korea following renewed engagement by the new management team. Both assets are now undergoing structured review and reactivation efforts designed to bring greater clarity, discipline, and value potential into the portfolio.\nIn the Philippines (Batangas), the Company has re-established direct engagement with the local counterparty and begun a comprehensive assessment of the project's development position. Historically held on a passive basis, the asset is now being moved to an active oversight framework. Management and the local partner are working towards a defined 2026-27 development timetable supported by clear reporting and milestone tracking. The intention is to agree a detailed work plan and establish a formal project tracker during Q1 2026, providing the Company with improved visibility over the project's pathway and potential future cashflow.\nIn Korea, the Company has initiated a full reassessment of the project structure and development pathway. Discussions are progressing with potential partners, including the locally engaged group previously associated with BMV, to determine whether a technically capable and well-capitalised local lead party can be put in place. In parallel, a formal legal review of the permitting and appeal position will commence in January 2026. This will provide a definitive understanding of the regulatory basis on which the asset can be advanced and will inform the decision between a development path or an orderly exit.\nOver the coming months, the Company will focus on establishing clear development options and execution responsibility across both assets. Key milestones include agreement of the Philippines development plan in early Q1 2026; confirmation by end December 2025 of whether the current Korea partner will assume a lead role; a legal assessment of the Korean permit status in January 2026; and a full viability review for Korea by the end of February 2026. The Company will provide further updates as progress is made.\nUpdate on Bitcoin Mining Equipment\nEarlier in the year the Company acquired a fleet of bitcoin mining machines for deployment into a contracted UAE project. Following regulatory changes introduced in October, the counterparty was unable to proceed and the planned deployment, hardware sale, and associated streaming structure were cancelled.\nThe machines remain in the Company's possession in new condition. Management is now assessing alternative routes to realise value, including either bringing the units online with established North American hosting providers or structuring a small hashrate-linked stream or sale. Given the modest scale of the fleet, any transaction is not expected to affect the overall composition of the business. The Company expects to reach a decision and execute the preferred route during Q1 2026.\nInstitutional Infrastructure (Reserve & Rail)\nBMV continues to build the institutional architecture that supports a modern gold-streaming and treasury platform across banking, precious metals and digital assets.\nBanking and Settlement\nOnboarding is underway with providers like Swiss private banks, digital-asset banks and institutional payment and FX platforms, establishing the GBP and USD settlement channels required for refinancing and treasury operations.\nPrecious Metals Execution and Trading\nThe Company is working with precious-metals execution venues and brokers to align physical-gold trading with emerging tokenised-gold infrastructure.\nGold Custody and Tokenised Instruments\nVaulting partners and tokenised-gold providers are being integrated to allow physical reserves to be held, traded or used as collateral within the treasury framework.\nDigital-Asset Execution and Prime Brokerage\nOnboarding is progressing with institutional OTC desks and prime brokers to support settlement flexibility, hedging and structured-yield strategies.\nDigital Custody\nSegregated digital-asset custody, through providers like Komainu or BitGo, is being established for tokenised-gold instruments and any BTC exposure.\nRisk, Reporting and Treasury Systems\nPortfolio-management and risk-infrastructure systems remain on track for activation to support FY2025 reporting and the next phase of capital deployment.\nTechnology Partnership\nBMV has entered into a development partnership with DOEFIN to advance intellectual property supporting trustless streaming structures for both gold-linked and bitcoin-linked contracts. The collaboration focuses on secure wallet architecture, automated collateral monitoring, and programmable settlement tools designed to reduce counterparty risk and improve transparency across future streaming transactions. Further updates will be provided as the workstream progresses with a proof-of-concept expected in late 2026.\nAcquisition of Quantum Research & Management Limited - Related-Party Transaction\nBMV has entered into a binding agreement to acquire Quantum Research & Management Limited, a UK company indirectly owned by Chief Executive Officer Sath Ganesarajah. The company is being acquired for de minimis consideration. The Board, excluding the interested director, reviewed the transaction under the Company's related-party governance protocols and approved it on the basis that the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.\nThe acquisition delivers immediate operational benefit, including UK banking arrangements suited to settlement and refinancing activities, crypto-custody and digital-operations capability aligned with the Company's Reserve & Rail architecture, and treasury support functions. The transaction also provides an immediate balance-sheet benefit of less than one bitcoin through assets held within the acquired entity.\nIntegration of Quantum Research & Management is expected to enhance BMV's operational readiness as the Company progresses its revised strategy and prepares for forthcoming refinancing and streaming-transaction execution.\nAn update on the Company's financing plans and prospectus process will be provided in the coming weeks.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer stated:\n\"We are pleased to provide an update on the rapid progress of our strategic transition into a gold-streaming and treasury company. Our immediate priorities centre on building institutional-grade infrastructure, implementing robust treasury governance and advancing high-impact gold-streaming opportunities to deliver near-term cash flows and scalable, long-term reserves. The groundwork we are laying has already identified a pipeline of transactions with significant potential to materially contribute in the short to medium term.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nThe Company encourages all investors to share questions on this announcement via its investor hub:\nhttps://bmvbtc.com/s/aca32f\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company.
