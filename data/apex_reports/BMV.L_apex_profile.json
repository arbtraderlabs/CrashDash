Under the WRAP Retail Offer up to 86,666,666\nnew Ordinary Shares (the \"\nWRAP Retail Offer Shares\n\") will be made available at a price of \u00a30.0015 per Ordinary Share (\"\nPlacing Price\n\")\n.\nThe WRAP Retail Offer is being made on the basis of the Company's Prospectus. Further information on Bluebird Mining Ventures is set out in the Prospectus which is or will shortly be available on the Company's website at\nCorporate Documents | A Gold Streaming & Treasury Company\n, subject to certain access restrictions, the National Storage Mechanism at\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\nsubject to applicable securities laws and regulations.\nIn addition to\nthe WRAP Retail Offer and as announced 18 December 2025, the Company h\nas also through CMC Markets UK Plc (\"\nCMC\n\"), trading as CapX has placed 333,333,333 Ordinary Shares (\"\nPlacing Shares\n\") on behalf of the Company with investors at the Placing Price (\"\nPlacing\n\"). As a result of the Placing, the Company has raised gross proceeds of \u00a3500,000. The Company received irrevocable commitments for 66,666,667 Ordinary Shares (\"\nSubscription Shares\n\") from investors at the Placing Price (\"\nSubscription\n\"). As a result of the Subscription, the Company has raised gross proceeds of \u00a3100,000. The Placing and the Subscription are conditional on\nadmission of the Placing Shares and the Subscription Shares to the Equity Shares (Transaction) Category of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities (\nAdmission\n)\n.

The Placing Price represents a discount of approximately 11.8 per cent. to the mid-market closing price of an Ordinary Share on 15 January 2026 (being the latest practicable date prior to this announcement). The issue price of the WRAP Retail Offer Shares is equal to the Placing Price.\nA separate announcement has been made regarding the Placing and Subscription on 18 December 2025 and the Prospectus set out the terms of these issues, the reasons for the Placing and Subscription and use of proceeds. The proceeds of the WRAP Retail Offer will be utilised in the same way as the proceeds of the Placing and the Subscription.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the WRAP Retail Offer is not part of the Placing or the Subscription. Completion of the WRAP Retail Offer is conditional, inter alia, upon the completion of the Placing and the Subscription but completion of the Placing and the Subscription (\"\nFundraising\n\") are not conditional on the completion of the WRAP Retail Offer\n.\nThe WRAP Retail Offer and the Fundraising are conditional on the Admission of the Fundraising Shares, the \"\nSalary Sacrifice Shares\n\") and the Trust Shares (\"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\").

These will inform the decision between progressing development or pursuing an orderly exit. Discussions are progressing with potential partners in respect of the South Korean projects. The Company is also currently looking for other investment opportunities in the mining sector. The Company will have a preference for gold assets but may invest in other projects related to other commodities if the investment was on favourable terms. In particular, the Group is looking to enter streaming and/or royalty arrangements that provide either a stream of gold or a financial return. The Group may also seek to make investments in mining infrastructure assets if the terms were sufficiently attractive. The Company may invest in the transaction directly or through its partner institution.\nThe Company is progressing a balanced set of gold-streaming and gold-linked transactions across Australia, West Africa, Central Asia and Southern Africa. Several of these transactions have the potential to produce early ounces within the next 6-9 months, while others have been targeted as they offer multi-year, expansion-linked growth. The current pipeline consists of a mix of producing assets and scalable long-life deposits. Structures being assessed include senior-secured streams and shorter cycle arrangements, with selective equity participation where this enhances long-term value.\nThe Company will provide further updates as these initiatives advance and key milestones are achieved.\nUpdate on the Placing and Subscription\nOn 18 December 2025 the Company announced a proposed fundraise, subject to regulatory approvals, of a total of \u00a3627,450, before expenses, by way of issue of 418,300,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at 0.15 pence per share. Of the total of the monies raised, \u00a3500,000 was via a placement with CMC Markets UK Plc (\"CMC\"), trading as CapX (\"Placing\") and the balance of \u00a3127,450 was via a subscription by HNW sophisticated investors (\"Subscription\"). The proceeds raised via the Subscription has been amended to \u00a3100,000 from \u00a3127,450 as announced on 18 December 2025.\nThe shares issued pursuant to the Placing and Subscription are expected to admitted to the equity shares (transition) category of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities at 8:00 am on Thursday 22 January 2026.\nWRAP Offer\nThe Company has plans later today to launch an offer of up to 86,666,666 Ordinary Shares at the Placing Price, via the WRAP offer to existing Shareholders. The Company will raise up to \u00a3130,000 from this offer. The details of the WRAP offer will be set out in a separate announcement by the Company.\nTrust Arrangements\nFurther to the announcement on 9 January 2026, the Company announced it had entered into a share incentive trust arrangement pursuant to which Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an entity owned and controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah (as trustee) agreed to subscribe for 650,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company. This arrangement has now been formalised in a Trust Deed dated 16 January 2026 as part the Company's desire to keep its cash burn to a minimum. Under this deed the 650,000,000 ordinary shares allocated for incentive arrangements (\"Trust Shares\") has been split into two parts. Firstly 300,000,000 ordinary shares which may be awarded to employees or former employees, or a spouse, civil partner, surviving spouse, surviving civil partner, minor child or minor step-child of an employees or former employees, directors and former directors of the Company and consultants of the Company (\"Incentive Beneficiaries\"). These awards are to be subject to achieving operational and/or financial milestones including growth in market capitalisation and financial metrics such as profit. These milestones still need to be agreed between the Company and Skylake but if agreement is not reached within three months the Company can buy these 300,000,000 Trust Shares (\"Incentive Shares\") back for \u00a31. The Company plans to implement an annual maximum of 100,000,000 Incentive Shares. The other 350,000,000 of the Trust Shares can be awarded to a party providing a service to the Company for which they are due a cash sum (\"Contractor Beneficiaries\"), which may include secondees or contractors provided by Skylake. These Ordinary Shares would be awarded in lieu of cash sum from a Company perspective, which should give the Company more cash to further its strategy. Therefore, the Trust Shares are held for the benefit of the Incentive Beneficiaries and the Contractor Beneficiaries (\"Beneficiaries\") rather than the Company as previously announced. The Trust Shares have been subscribed for at the same price as ordinary shares issued under the Placing and the Subscription being \u00a30.0015 per Ordinary Share rather than \u00a30.005 per Ordinary Share as previously announced. As Skylake has only gifted \u00a36,500 to this trust arrangement, this left a balance of \u00a3968,500 from the trust for the Trust Shares which has been advanced by the Company to the trust on an interest free basis and is repayable on demand. It is anticipated that Sath Ganesarajah will be a member of the pool of people eligible for the milestone-based awards of Incentive Shares but will not be one of the Contractor Beneficiaries.\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming, mining and treasury company.

          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 2478O\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n09 January 2026\n9 January 2026\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n(\"BMV or the \"Company\")\nStrategic Update\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd (\"BMV\" or the \"Company\"), the gold streaming and treasury company, provides a further update following its Operational Update announcement of 10 December 2025 and the Capital Reorganisation announcement dated 18 December 2025.\nMarket backdrop and inbound interest\nSince the Company's Operational Update on 10 December 2025, BMV has experienced a marked increase in inbound interest relating to its gold streaming and treasury strategy. This includes engagement from counterparties exploring tokenised and digitally settled gold structures, as well as institutional and strategic participants seeking exposure through structured upstream arrangements spanning physical metal, derivative-linked flows, and tokenised formats.\nThe Board believes this renewed interest reflects a broader crossover between digital asset infrastructure and physical gold, alongside evolving macro conditions. In particular, the Company notes the current interest-rate outlook and the potential rollback of certain US trade tariffs as factors that may act as catalysts for renewed risk appetite, providing structural tailwinds for gold-linked treasury and streaming strategies. The Board continues to believe that BMV's gold streaming and treasury model is well positioned to capture this demand in a disciplined and regulated manner.\nTechnology partnership with BE\nBMV is pleased to confirm a strategic technology partnership with The BE Company (\"BE\"), an affiliated entity in which the Company's Chief Executive Officer has an interest, pursuant to which BE will act as BMV's recognised technology partner. BE is a clean energy and AI infrastructure business with operations in the UK, US, and Canada.\nUnder this arrangement, BE will provide in-kind advisory and development support across:\n\u00b7\nIT security and data management\n\u00b7\nDigital and data-centre infrastructure\n\u00b7\nHosting services and software licensing\n\u00b7\nHigh-performance computing and GPU-based platforms\nThe scope also includes support for research and development activities focused on advanced data-driven analysis and high-performance computing applications for geological and subsurface interpretation. The relationship is expected to support business development initiatives during 2026, with the potential for selective commercialisation later in the year. All intellectual property generated under this arrangement will remain the property of BE. BMV will be granted a non-exclusive licence to deploy such technology within its own operations and client services.\nThe Board emphasises that these technology initiatives are supportive and exploratory, with the Company's primary focus remaining its gold streaming and treasury strategy.\nUpdate on equity arrangements\nFurther to the Company's announcement of 18 December 2025, the Board confirms that the previously announced Management and External Investor Equity Subscription Facility and related incentive proposals will not proceed and are being replaced by a revised equity-based arrangement involving Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an entity owned and controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah. The Company has entered into a share incentive trust arrangement pursuant to which Skylake has agreed to subscribe for 650,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company for an aggregate consideration of \u00a33.25 million on a fully paid basis, with \u00a36,250 payable on issue and the balance payable subject to finalisation of a formal incentive scheme over the next few months. The trust is for the benefit of the Company and includes provision for the return of the shares if the milestones for incentive awards cannot be agreed. Furthermore, Skylake has agreed not to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares whilst they are held on trust for the Company. The share incentive trust arrangement is intended to support the provision of seconded services to the Company in lieu of cash remuneration with flexibility to provide working capital as required.\nThe Board further confirms that the Company has been notified that the previously announced acquisition by Skylake of certain warrants in the Company will not proceed. Discussions remain ongoing and the Company will update the market as appropriate.\nThe Board confirms that, notwithstanding the above, the Company's fully diluted share capital position remains unchanged from that disclosed in the announcement dated 18 December 2025.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer of BMV, said:\n\"The increased level of interest we are seeing reflects a growing convergence between physical gold and modern financial infrastructure. BMV will prioritise partnerships that enhance execution capability without diverting focus from the core business. We remain focused on executing our gold streaming and treasury strategy, maintaining balance-sheet discipline, and progressing selective partnerships that support scalable, compliant growth.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nThe Company encourages all investors to share questions on this announcement via its investor hub:\nhttps://bmvbtc.com/s/aca32f\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company.

In addition, the Company has initiated a capital reorganisation programme to stabilise the balance sheet and establish a structured funding framework to support the Company's revised gold-focused streaming and treasury strategy.\nThe measures described below are at varying stages of implementation and are being progressed in parallel. All transactions, arrangements and initiatives referred to in this announcement are subject, where applicable, to regulatory approvals, shareholder authorities and the UK prospectus regime.\nThese actions have been undertaken in coordination with Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an investment vehicle controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah.\nFundraise and Acquisition of Legacy Loans\nPlacing and Subscription\nThe Company, subject to regulatory approvals, has completed a fundraise of a total of \u00a3627,450, before expenses, by way of issue of 418,300,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at 0.15 pence per share. Of the total of the monies raised, \u00a3500,000 was via a Placement with CMC Markets UK Plc (\"CMC\"), trading as CapX and the balance of \u00a3127,450 was via Subscription by HNW sophisticated investors.\nThe Placing, Subscription and admission of new ordinary shares to trading remains subject to regulatory approvals, shareholder authorities and the UK prospectus regime and the Company will update the market further as appropriate. The proceeds are expected to provide working capital and support the Company's transition to its gold-focused strategy.\nCMC acted as the Company's sole placing agent in respect of the Placing. BMV is also pleased to announce that CMC has been appointed as the Company's joint corporate broker.\nAcquisition of Legacy Loans - Related Party Transaction\nTwo legacy loans totalling \u00a3200,000 and due in December 2025 have been acquired by Skylake. Skylake has agreed, in principle, to extend repayment on mutually agreed terms, with no additional interest or penalties. The consolidation of these obligations under an aligned lender is intended to remove near-term liquidity pressure and provide balance-sheet stability while the Company advances its revised strategy.\nThe Board, excluding the interested director, reviewed the transaction under the Company's related-party governance protocols and approved it on the basis that the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.\nManagement and External Investor Equity Subscription Facility\nIn addition, the Company has established a framework for a \u00a33.25 million fixed-price equity subscription facility at 0.50 pence per share.\nKey features include:\n\u00b7\nissuance in tranches at the discretion of the Company\n\u00b7\nparticipation by management, Skylake and selected unconnected investors\n\u00b7\nflexibility in timing and sizing of equity issuance\n\u00b7\nstructuring intended to support orderly capital formation in compliance with applicable Listing Rules and regulatory requirements\nAny equity subscriptions under this framework are conditional and subject to the UK prospectus regime, applicable exemptions and regulatory approvals. There is no guarantee that a prospectus will be published or that any such subscriptions will complete.\nCapital Formation Summary (Indicative)\nThe following issuances are envisaged as part of the broader funding framework, subject to regulatory compliance:\n\u00b7\n418,300,000 shares at 0.15 pence raising \u00a3627,450\n\u00b7\nup to 650,000,000 shares at 0.50 pence under the equity subscription framework\nOn completion of all such issuances, total shares in issue would be 1,931,983,704.\nIntended Capital Reorganisation\nWarrant Cancellation\nSkylake has agreed to acquire two major blocks of deep-discount warrants, comprising more than 80 per cent of warrants exercisable at 0.23 pence, from former significant holders. It is intended that all such warrants acquired by Skylake will be cancelled. The cancellation process is being progressed and, once completed, is expected to remove a long-standing structural overhang and support a simplified capital structure ahead of future institutional engagement.\nSkylake Shareholding\nAs part of the stabilisation and capital-structure actions described above, Skylake expects to acquire up to 100,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company, subject to completion of the relevant transactions. These shares are being acquired in connection with the broader restructuring measures currently underway.\nBalance Sheet Stabilisation\nSubject to completion of the relevant steps, Skylake has agreed to:\n\u00b7\ncancel all deep-discount warrants acquired by it\n\u00b7\nextend the assigned legacy loans on mutually agreed terms with no additional interest or penalties\n\u00b7\nsupport the funding framework described below\nTermination of Previous Line of Credit\nThe Company and Skylake have agreed to terminate the former line-of-credit facility. That facility was structured for a discontinued digital-asset strategy and is no longer aligned with the Company's regulated gold-streaming and treasury focus.\nRegulatory Position and Prospectus\nThe Company is admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange Main Market.

          "release_time": "7:00 am",

          "content": "10 Dec 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 9100K\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n10 December 2025\n10 December 2025\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n(\"BMV or the \"Company\")\nOperational Update\nFurther to the announcement of 2 December 2025, Bluebird Mining Ventures, the gold streaming and treasury company, provides an update on the progress it is making on its gold-streaming and treasury platform, BTC-linked opportunities, institutional-infrastructure build-out, and the advancement of legacy assets.\nWorkstreams covering treasury governance, execution protocols, reporting standards and digital infrastructure are being finalised ahead of increased deployment activity expected from January 2026. This includes institutional-grade controls designed to support both gold-streaming flows and the Company's broader treasury objectives.\nGold-Streaming and Treasury Platform Development\nBMV is progressing a balanced set of gold-streaming and gold-linked transactions across Australia, West Africa, Central Asia and Southern Africa. These opportunities span producing sites, expansion-ready projects and modular processing operations. The portfolio has been designed to balance short-duration cash-impact with longer-life reserve exposure, consistent with BMV's focus on recurring gold flows rather than ownership of mining operations.\nThe transactions under development share common features:\n\u2022 near-term operational cashflow, in several cases from early 2026\n\u2022 structures ranging from senior-secured streams to rolling short-cycle arrangements\n\u2022 exposure to both stable producing assets and scalable long-life deposits\n\u2022 optional equity participation where it strengthens long-term returns\n\u2022 multi-year visibility on gold deliveries, with scope to recycle flows into future streams\nThe Directors believe that collectively, these transactions have the potential for material contribution to the Company's gold-backed treasury in the short-to-mid term. Several of these transactions have the potential to produce early ounces within the next 6-9 months, while others have been targeted as they offer multi-year, expansion-linked growth.\nBTC-Linked Opportunities\nTo complement the gold-streaming platform with optionality in settlement, liquidity and yield - while maintaining the Company's core focus on physical-gold reserves - BMV is assessing a limited number of BTC-linked opportunities within the permitted scope of its treasury operations. Any such exposure is expected to be structured through streaming or BTC-linked arrangements, with cashflows either converted into gold or retained within treasury.\nThe Company will progress and execute any BTC-linked arrangements with full consideration of the applicable class-test thresholds under the Listing Rules, ensuring that any transaction remains within the appropriate regulatory parameters.\nUpdate on Existing Gold Interests: Philippines (Batangas) and Korea\nThe Company provides an update on its legacy gold interests in the Philippines and Korea following renewed engagement by the new management team. Both assets are now undergoing structured review and reactivation efforts designed to bring greater clarity, discipline, and value potential into the portfolio.\nIn the Philippines (Batangas), the Company has re-established direct engagement with the local counterparty and begun a comprehensive assessment of the project's development position. Historically held on a passive basis, the asset is now being moved to an active oversight framework. Management and the local partner are working towards a defined 2026-27 development timetable supported by clear reporting and milestone tracking. The intention is to agree a detailed work plan and establish a formal project tracker during Q1 2026, providing the Company with improved visibility over the project's pathway and potential future cashflow.\nIn Korea, the Company has initiated a full reassessment of the project structure and development pathway. Discussions are progressing with potential partners, including the locally engaged group previously associated with BMV, to determine whether a technically capable and well-capitalised local lead party can be put in place. In parallel, a formal legal review of the permitting and appeal position will commence in January 2026. This will provide a definitive understanding of the regulatory basis on which the asset can be advanced and will inform the decision between a development path or an orderly exit.\nOver the coming months, the Company will focus on establishing clear development options and execution responsibility across both assets. Key milestones include agreement of the Philippines development plan in early Q1 2026; confirmation by end December 2025 of whether the current Korea partner will assume a lead role; a legal assessment of the Korean permit status in January 2026; and a full viability review for Korea by the end of February 2026. The Company will provide further updates as progress is made.\nUpdate on Bitcoin Mining Equipment\nEarlier in the year the Company acquired a fleet of bitcoin mining machines for deployment into a contracted UAE project. Following regulatory changes introduced in October, the counterparty was unable to proceed and the planned deployment, hardware sale, and associated streaming structure were cancelled.\nThe machines remain in the Company's possession in new condition. Management is now assessing alternative routes to realise value, including either bringing the units online with established North American hosting providers or structuring a small hashrate-linked stream or sale. Given the modest scale of the fleet, any transaction is not expected to affect the overall composition of the business. The Company expects to reach a decision and execute the preferred route during Q1 2026.\nInstitutional Infrastructure (Reserve & Rail)\nBMV continues to build the institutional architecture that supports a modern gold-streaming and treasury platform across banking, precious metals and digital assets.\nBanking and Settlement\nOnboarding is underway with providers like Swiss private banks, digital-asset banks and institutional payment and FX platforms, establishing the GBP and USD settlement channels required for refinancing and treasury operations.\nPrecious Metals Execution and Trading\nThe Company is working with precious-metals execution venues and brokers to align physical-gold trading with emerging tokenised-gold infrastructure.\nGold Custody and Tokenised Instruments\nVaulting partners and tokenised-gold providers are being integrated to allow physical reserves to be held, traded or used as collateral within the treasury framework.\nDigital-Asset Execution and Prime Brokerage\nOnboarding is progressing with institutional OTC desks and prime brokers to support settlement flexibility, hedging and structured-yield strategies.\nDigital Custody\nSegregated digital-asset custody, through providers like Komainu or BitGo, is being established for tokenised-gold instruments and any BTC exposure.\nRisk, Reporting and Treasury Systems\nPortfolio-management and risk-infrastructure systems remain on track for activation to support FY2025 reporting and the next phase of capital deployment.\nTechnology Partnership\nBMV has entered into a development partnership with DOEFIN to advance intellectual property supporting trustless streaming structures for both gold-linked and bitcoin-linked contracts. The collaboration focuses on secure wallet architecture, automated collateral monitoring, and programmable settlement tools designed to reduce counterparty risk and improve transparency across future streaming transactions. Further updates will be provided as the workstream progresses with a proof-of-concept expected in late 2026.\nAcquisition of Quantum Research & Management Limited - Related-Party Transaction\nBMV has entered into a binding agreement to acquire Quantum Research & Management Limited, a UK company indirectly owned by Chief Executive Officer Sath Ganesarajah. The company is being acquired for de minimis consideration. The Board, excluding the interested director, reviewed the transaction under the Company's related-party governance protocols and approved it on the basis that the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.\nThe acquisition delivers immediate operational benefit, including UK banking arrangements suited to settlement and refinancing activities, crypto-custody and digital-operations capability aligned with the Company's Reserve & Rail architecture, and treasury support functions. The transaction also provides an immediate balance-sheet benefit of less than one bitcoin through assets held within the acquired entity.\nIntegration of Quantum Research & Management is expected to enhance BMV's operational readiness as the Company progresses its revised strategy and prepares for forthcoming refinancing and streaming-transaction execution.\nAn update on the Company's financing plans and prospectus process will be provided in the coming weeks.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer stated:\n\"We are pleased to provide an update on the rapid progress of our strategic transition into a gold-streaming and treasury company. Our immediate priorities centre on building institutional-grade infrastructure, implementing robust treasury governance and advancing high-impact gold-streaming opportunities to deliver near-term cash flows and scalable, long-term reserves. The groundwork we are laying has already identified a pipeline of transactions with significant potential to materially contribute in the short to medium term.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nThe Company encourages all investors to share questions on this announcement via its investor hub:\nhttps://bmvbtc.com/s/aca32f\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company.
