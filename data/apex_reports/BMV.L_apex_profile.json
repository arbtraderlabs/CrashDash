          "content": "18 Dec 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 0257M\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n18 December 2025\n18 December 2025\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\n(\"BMV or the \"Company\")\nCapital Reorganisation and\nProposed Fundraise\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV), the gold streaming and treasury company, is pleased to announce a proposed equity fundraise to raise \u00a3627,450 through a placing and subscription (the \"\nFundraise\n\"). In addition, the Company has initiated a capital reorganisation programme to stabilise the balance sheet and establish a structured funding framework to support the Company's revised gold-focused streaming and treasury strategy.\nThe measures described below are at varying stages of implementation and are being progressed in parallel. All transactions, arrangements and initiatives referred to in this announcement are subject, where applicable, to regulatory approvals, shareholder authorities and the UK prospectus regime.\nThese actions have been undertaken in coordination with Skylake Management LLP (\"Skylake\"), an investment vehicle controlled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Sath Ganesarajah.\nFundraise and Acquisition of Legacy Loans\nPlacing and Subscription\nThe Company, subject to regulatory approvals, has completed a fundraise of a total of \u00a3627,450, before expenses, by way of issue of 418,300,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at 0.15 pence per share. Of the total of the monies raised, \u00a3500,000 was via a Placement with CMC Markets UK Plc (\"CMC\"), trading as CapX and the balance of \u00a3127,450 was via Subscription by HNW sophisticated investors.\nThe Placing, Subscription and admission of new ordinary shares to trading remains subject to regulatory approvals, shareholder authorities and the UK prospectus regime and the Company will update the market further as appropriate. The proceeds are expected to provide working capital and support the Company's transition to its gold-focused strategy.\nCMC acted as the Company's sole placing agent in respect of the Placing. BMV is also pleased to announce that CMC has been appointed as the Company's joint corporate broker.\nAcquisition of Legacy Loans - Related Party Transaction\nTwo legacy loans totalling \u00a3200,000 and due in December 2025 have been acquired by Skylake. Skylake has agreed, in principle, to extend repayment on mutually agreed terms, with no additional interest or penalties. The consolidation of these obligations under an aligned lender is intended to remove near-term liquidity pressure and provide balance-sheet stability while the Company advances its revised strategy.\nThe Board, excluding the interested director, reviewed the transaction under the Company's related-party governance protocols and approved it on the basis that the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.\nManagement and External Investor Equity Subscription Facility\nIn addition, the Company has established a framework for a \u00a33.25 million fixed-price equity subscription facility at 0.50 pence per share.\nKey features include:\n\u00b7\nissuance in tranches at the discretion of the Company\n\u00b7\nparticipation by management, Skylake and selected unconnected investors\n\u00b7\nflexibility in timing and sizing of equity issuance\n\u00b7\nstructuring intended to support orderly capital formation in compliance with applicable Listing Rules and regulatory requirements\nAny equity subscriptions under this framework are conditional and subject to the UK prospectus regime, applicable exemptions and regulatory approvals. There is no guarantee that a prospectus will be published or that any such subscriptions will complete.\nCapital Formation Summary (Indicative)\nThe following issuances are envisaged as part of the broader funding framework, subject to regulatory compliance:\n\u00b7\n418,300,000 shares at 0.15 pence raising \u00a3627,450\n\u00b7\nup to 650,000,000 shares at 0.50 pence under the equity subscription framework\nOn completion of all such issuances, total shares in issue would be 1,931,983,704.\nIntended Capital Reorganisation\nWarrant Cancellation\nSkylake has agreed to acquire two major blocks of deep-discount warrants, comprising more than 80 per cent of warrants exercisable at 0.23 pence, from former significant holders. It is intended that all such warrants acquired by Skylake will be cancelled. The cancellation process is being progressed and, once completed, is expected to remove a long-standing structural overhang and support a simplified capital structure ahead of future institutional engagement.\nSkylake Shareholding\nAs part of the stabilisation and capital-structure actions described above, Skylake expects to acquire up to 100,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company, subject to completion of the relevant transactions. These shares are being acquired in connection with the broader restructuring measures currently underway.\nBalance Sheet Stabilisation\nSubject to completion of the relevant steps, Skylake has agreed to:\n\u00b7\ncancel all deep-discount warrants acquired by it\n\u00b7\nextend the assigned legacy loans on mutually agreed terms with no additional interest or penalties\n\u00b7\nsupport the funding framework described below\nTermination of Previous Line of Credit\nThe Company and Skylake have agreed to terminate the former line-of-credit facility. That facility was structured for a discontinued digital-asset strategy and is no longer aligned with the Company's regulated gold-streaming and treasury focus.\nRegulatory Position and Prospectus\nThe Company is admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange Main Market. All transactions, arrangements and initiatives referred to in this announcement, including any proposed equity subscriptions, facilities, placements or issuances of ordinary shares, are subject to the UK prospectus regime, applicable exemptions, shareholder authorities and all relevant regulatory requirements.\nThere can be no certainty that a prospectus will be published or approved, or that any of the transactions described in this announcement will proceed, in whole or in part.\nBoth the Company and potential subscribers note that, following changes to the UK listing framework effective from 19 January, Main Market issuers have increased flexibility in relation to further issuances of shares under their existing listing arrangements. Any use of that flexibility by the Company will remain conditional on compliance with the prospectus regime, applicable exemptions and regulatory approvals.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer of BMV, said:\n\"This fundraise and the capital reorganisation will give BMV a stronger foundation to advance its growth strategy. With legacy instruments being addressed, near-term liabilities stabilised and a structured funding framework being implemented, the Company is progressing towards execution of its gold-streaming and regulated treasury strategy, with the objective of generating long-term exposure to physical gold in a disciplined and compliant manner.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore, Anysia Virdi\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nThe Company encourages all investors to share questions on this announcement via its investor hub:\nhttps://bmvbtc.com/s/aca32f\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company.

The review assessed operations, capital allocation, and prevailing conditions across precious metals and digital assets. The Company is now concentrating on cashflow generation, balance-sheet resilience, and scalable exposure to physical gold.\nNew growth strategy\nBMV is establishing a gold streaming and treasury platform designed to deliver long-term, compounding value through reserve growth and structured yield. Investor interest has centred on tangible, income-producing assets and transparent access to bullion. The revised strategy reflects this shift.\nKey elements of the strategy:\n\u00b7\nGold streaming and treasury platform -\nStructured gold streaming agreements and disciplined treasury management that combine predictable yield with verifiable reserve accumulation.\n\u00b7\nDirect bullion exposure -\nScalable exposure to physical gold without the operational and execution risks associated with mine ownership.\n\u00b7\nCapital-efficient growth -\nFocus on multi-year streams across the ore-to-bullion value chain, securing recurring gold flows that can be recycled into new transactions.\n\u00b7\nUse of Bitcoin as a payment rail -\nBitcoin may be used solely as a settlement mechanism including in jurisdictions with exchange-control constraints, subject to the Company's internal gross-asset limit.\n\u00b7\nKorea -\nContinued efforts to secure required permits and assess suitable partnership opportunities, aligned with the improved outlook for gold assets. An update will follow in due course.\n\u00b7\nSelective mining-adjacent investments -\nEvaluation of near-term cashflow opportunities that support and complement the streaming and treasury model.\nThis strategy positions BMV as a focused, capital-efficient platform combining the stability of physical gold with the scalability of streaming structures.\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer, of BMV stated:\n\"BMV's new strategy positions the company as a next-generation gold streaming and treasury platform, delivering long-term, compounding value through disciplined reserve growth, structured yield, and direct exposure to physical bullion. It also brings the company into line with growing demand for income-producing, inflation-resistant investments backed by the enduring value of gold, without the risks of mine ownership.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nBluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nSath Ganesarajah, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nGracechurch Group\nHarry Chathli, Alexis Gore\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nAbout Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd\nBluebird Mining Ventures (LSE: BMV) is a gold streaming and treasury company. BMV's mission is to build and manage a gold-backed treasury through streaming agreements, providing investors with exposure to physical gold without the operational risk of mining.\nBMV focuses on streams from producing assets within the ore concentrate to bullion value chain. Its investments secure multi-year flows of gold that can be recycled into new transactions. This model enables scalable exposure to gold without capital expenditure, or execution risks.\nDrawing on its heritage in gold, BMV combines the stability of physical bullion with the benefits of a scalable, disciplined business model. With a focus on prudent capital allocation and treasury management, BMV aims to deliver sustainable, long-term value for shareholders.\nFor more information, please visit: www.bmvbtc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
