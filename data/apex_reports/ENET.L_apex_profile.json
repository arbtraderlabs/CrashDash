      "A collapsed stock with no trading activity can become a target for a reverse takeover or a strategic acquisition by a larger firm, offering a hidden upside if the event materialises.",

The absence of data creates a high\u2011risk environment, but it also opens a niche for opportunistic investors looking for reverse takeovers or relisting scenarios. Vigilant monitoring of filings and market announcements is essential before committing any capital."
