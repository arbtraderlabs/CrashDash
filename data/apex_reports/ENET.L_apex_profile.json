      "The nominal entry price of 0.00p could be exploited by distressed\u2011arbitrage traders if the shares become tradable again, offering a potential low\u2011cost entry.",

While the 0.00p price suggests a cheap entry for a distressed arbitrage, the high risk of illiquidity and potential regulatory or fraud issues make any investment highly speculative and likely to result in a total loss."
