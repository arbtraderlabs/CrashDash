We have an exceptional proposition, underpinned by a funding model which provides our customers with a truly off-balance sheet solution, which we believe is unique in the UK market.\n\"eEnergy is growing from strength to strength and is seeing increasing demand for its services. We recorded revenues of \u00a323.0m in FY25, and are pleased to report significant improvement in profitability, with Group Adjusted EBITDA* increasing 183% to \u00a31.7m (2024: \u00a30.6m). This reflects how we have now optimised our operating structure and cost base, improved our operating efficiencies, and succeeded in maintaining strong organic growth in our direct sales pipeline.\n\"We are pleased to have secured several major new contracts and awards in H2-25, namely Mace, LASER and the NHS NEEF portfolio. Despite the strong sales growth over FY25, evidenced by our record year-end contracted order book which is 100% higher from the position at the start of the FY25, a small number of large contracts were delayed which we expect to conclude in H1-26.\n\"Whilst this shift in anticipated revenues beyond the FY25 year-end was frustrating, the underlying contract economics and gross values are unchanged. This revenue is now expected in H1-26 which, alongside our strong pipeline, significantly increases the Board's confidence for the outlook in FY26.\n\"As we commence FY26, we do so with a record forward order book of \u00a314.0m, a 100% increase over the position at the start of the year\n(\u00a37.0m), a stable operating platform, a highly experienced operational management team and a streamlined cost structure. Our focus is now on securing and delivering larger scale projects, improving gross margin and cash generation and we expect to see record revenues in H1-26. The FY25 revenue shift into FY26 was timing-related only and consequently we have upgraded FY26 guidance for revenue by 13.3% from \u00a330.0m to \u00a334.0m, and Adjusted EBITDA by 12.5% from \u00a34.0m to \u00a34.5m.\n\"We have secured large scale government contracts which demonstrates the confidence in our execution and delivery model which is now poised for scale. These deals bring the benefit of assured scale and long-term value but, with that, comes the inevitability of more complex sign off procedures with multi-party procurement structures.\n\"Finally, the Board is pleased to welcome Nicholas Mills as a Non-Executive Director to the Company. Nicholas brings extensive experience, and the Board looks forward to drawing on his insight and expertise as we continue to deliver on our strategy. Nicholas's appointment, alongside Harwood's active, long-term value approach and its record of accomplishment and of working closely with smaller UK companies to unlock potential, provides the Board with additional support as we focus on accelerating performance and driving improved returns for all shareholders.\n\"I look forward to 2026 with continued confidence.\"\nInvestor presentation\nThere will be an online presentation, open to all existing and potential shareholders, via Investor Meet Company at 10.00.am on 26 January 2026.

The contract with Symphony Healthcare Services Limited (a subsidiary of Somerset NHS Foundation Trust) covers LED lighting upgrades across 18 GP surgeries, with a total contract value of c\u00a30.7 million, and will be delivered across Somerset (South West England).\nBacked by Redaptive, this new, unique, funding solution enables eEnergy to install the energy-savings systems at the customers sites, whilst the customer pays for the equipment from energy savings or total use rather than as an upfront payment. eEnergy retains operational responsibility for the installed equipment, supporting service-style treatment.\nThe EPC funding structure is a first of its kind in the UK, a much needed solution for the NHS that is expected to be transformational for NHS organisations. Developed in response to recent IFRS accounting rule changes, this solution has been specifically designed to help NHS bodies overcome IFRS 16 related on balance sheet considerations.\nThis EPC is available to all organisations and businesses and is specifically designed for the UK public sector. The solution has been specifically structured to address key barriers that can slow adoption of energy transition and on-site generation in the public sector.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, said:\n\"The challenge is unlocking fast delivery without consuming scarce capital or creating unwanted balance-sheet complexity. While Great British Energy is expected to support projects across the UK healthcare and education sectors, many NHS Trusts remain constrained in accessing at pace proven technologies such as LED lighting, Solar PV, and EV charging. Our EPC solution is designed to address this gap and remove barriers faced by NHS organisations.\n\"At eEnergy, we are constantly exploring new and innovative ways to help organisations accelerate their net zero journey. This new solution strengthens our ability to deliver energy-saving projects without incurring upfront cost, helping more clients reduce consumption, cut costs, and achieve their sustainability goals. Combined with the Group's multiple public sector framework awards, it positions eEnergy to help accelerate delivery of NHS decarbonisation programmes.\n\"Winning our first EPC-funded contract with Symphony Healthcare Services Limited is an important validation. It demonstrates clear appetite for an NHS-ready solution and provides a platform to scale LED programmes today while supporting a broader pathway to Solar PV and EV infrastructure.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris, David Asquith\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 20 7920 3150\nJos Simson, Nick Dibden, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nA\nbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is a UK-based Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) provider, funding and delivering energy-saving and energy-generating solutions across multi-site public sector and commercial portfolios-helping customers cut energy waste, reduce operating costs, and improve building resilience with zero upfront cost.\neEnergy delivers four core solutions:\n\u00b7\nReduce\n: LED lighting and controls\n\u00b7\nGenerate\n: Solar PV (rooftop, ground mount, and carport)\n\u00b7\nStore\n: Battery storage (store onsite generation and reduce peak-time import costs)\n\u00b7\nCharge\n: EV charging infrastructure and management\nProjects are funded through dedicated facilities, including up to \u00a3100m of project funding via eEnergy's partnership with Redaptive, and a \u00a340m NatWest facility supporting public sector deployments.\neEnergy's routes to market include direct sales, public sector frameworks, tenders, and strategic partnerships.

In addition, it provides an operational update on the rollout and mobilisation of its significant solar PV agreement announced on 1 September 2025.\nAs announced at the Half Year Results, the Company continues to see strong demand for its services and has developed an investment grade pipeline of c.\u00a3127m net revenue across 996 active projects created in FY2025. The Group was also pleased to announce several record new contracts in the Period, particularly for its Solar PV business. During the Period, the Group also began the installations as part of an enlarged program of work with Mace which now encompasses solar PV, LED, EV charging and battery installation across what is now circa 74 schools mainly in the Midlands and partly in the London area. This work is expected to be completed by end of Q12026.\nDuring the Period, the Group was awarded a \u00a31.5m solar PV installation contract by the bakery Brioche Pasquier, with the project now live. This carport project is one of the UK's largest carport systems, and positions eEnergy well to meet the strong growth in demand expected for car port solar PV products in 2026.\nThe Company is now appointed on five frameworks which are already yielding results with contracts being awarded, notably the \u00a30.5m contract with University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, won through the NHS Commercial Solutions framework. These frameworks broaden the Group's channels to market alongside its direct sales.\nSince entering the \u00a3100m funding partnership with Redaptive Inc in May 2025, eEnergy has drawn down USD$17.4m of the fund covering over 175 solar and LED projects across 179 locations and 51 customers.\nFY2025 and Outlook\nThe business is now benefiting from additional sector exposure, an expanded technology offering and a reduced reliance on direct sales with significant revenue derived from tenders. The Company has increased its participation in major frameworks and is seeing access to a growing number of larger contract opportunities, which is all consistent with the Group's strategy to pursue larger contract awards and diversifying.\nDespite significant progress made during the year, with substantial pipeline growth, the securing of several major contracts and gross margins continuing to show improvement year on year, the Group now expects approximately \u00a33m-\u00a34m of previously anticipated FY2025 revenue to be recognised in H12026. This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026. These revenues will now be incremental to FY26 and, alongside the currently secured record contracted FY26 order book of \u00a310.5m (January 2025: \u00a37.0m) and the Group's growing investment grade pipeline of opportunities created in FY2025, the Group expects a record FY2026 as outlined below.\nThe Company remains in final stage discussions with several NHS trusts awaiting decisions on NHS Energy Efficiency Fund (NEEF), which it expects decisions on by year end, with delivery on these contracts commencing in January 2026.\nAs a result of the factors outlined above, the Board now anticipates revenue for FY2025 will be between \u00a323m-\u00a324m (FY24: \u00a325.1m) depending on the value of contracts awarded and signed in the last two weeks of December this year. In addition, the Board now expects adjusted EBITDA to show material increase over the prior year (FY2024: \u00a30.6m) with a current range for FY2025 of between \u00a31.5m-\u00a31.9m, subject to the outcome of new sales awards in the remainder of the year.\nWith the expected increased run rate of new sales converting into revenue and the circa \u00a33m-4m of expected H22025 revenue now expected in H12026, the Board expects a corresponding uplift in revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA for FY2026. Given the significant quantum of contract revenues underpinning the improved FY2026 revenue and profit performance, the Board estimates H12026 revenue in the region of c.\u00a320m, double the previous year. The Board also revises guidance for FY2026 revenues and adjusted EBITDA, upgrading both by c.13% to \u00a334m and \u00a34.5m respectively.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, commented:\n\"eEnergy continues to see strong demand for its services and we are pleased to have secured several record contracts in H2 2025. Despite the continued growth in our new sales pipeline, contract signings have been delayed and we are now expecting the majority of the Mace installation and new sales awards to be recognised in H12026. Whilst this shift in revenues beyond the year end is frustrating, the underlying contract economics and gross value are unchanged. This portion of revenue is now concentrated into early FY2026 which, alongside our strong pipeline, significantly increases the Board's confidence in an improved financial outturn in FY2026. The slippage experienced was timing-related only, and consequently we have upgraded FY2026 guidance for revenue by c.13% from \u00a330m to \u00a334m, and adjusted EBITDA by c.12.5% from \u00a34m to \u00a34.5m.\n\"We remain focused on enabling organisations to achieve sustainable energy savings, protect themselves against future energy price volatility, and accelerate progress toward net zero. We have continued to deliver on our strategy, focusing on participating in more public sector framework deals. These bring the benefit of assured scale and long-term value but, as we have witnessed recently, it brings associated risk of unpredictability around formalisation and installation of the work due to the nature of multi-party procurement structures. Furthermore, we have rationalised our cost base, improved our operating efficiencies and maintain a strong pipeline and growth trajectory. I look forward to 2026 with continued confidence.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 20 7920 3150\nJos Simson, Nick Dibden, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nAbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is a UK-based Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) provider, funding and delivering energy-saving and energy-generating solutions across multi-site public sector and commercial portfolios-helping customers cut energy waste, reduce operating costs, and improve building resilience with zero upfront cost.\neEnergy delivers four core solutions:\n\u00b7\nReduce\n: LED lighting and controls\n\u00b7\nGenerate\n: Solar PV (rooftop, ground mount, and carport)\n\u00b7\nStore:\nBattery storage (store onsite generation and reduce peak-time import costs)\n\u00b7\nCharge\n: EV charging infrastructure and management\nProjects are funded through dedicated facilities, including up to \u00a3100m of project funding via eEnergy's partnership with Redaptive, and a \u00a340m NatWest facility supporting public sector deployments.\neEnergy's routes to market include direct sales, public sector frameworks, tenders and strategic partnerships.

          "full_content": "15 Dec 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 5486L\neEnergy Group PLC\n15 December 2025\n15 December 2025\neEnergy Group plc\n(\"eEnergy\", \"the Company\" or \"the Group\")\nFY Trading Update\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS), an Energy-as-a-Service provider funding and delivering energy infrastructure upgrades across multi-site portfolios with zero upfront cost, provides a trading update for the five months ended 30 November 2025 (the \"Period\"), ahead of the financial year ending 31 December 2025. In addition, it provides an operational update on the rollout and mobilisation of its significant solar PV agreement announced on 1 September 2025.\nAs announced at the Half Year Results, the Company continues to see strong demand for its services and has developed an investment grade pipeline of c.\u00a3127m net revenue across 996 active projects created in FY2025. The Group was also pleased to announce several record new contracts in the Period, particularly for its Solar PV business. During the Period, the Group also began the installations as part of an enlarged program of work with Mace which now encompasses solar PV, LED, EV charging and battery installation across what is now circa 74 schools mainly in the Midlands and partly in the London area. This work is expected to be completed by end of Q12026.\nDuring the Period, the Group was awarded a \u00a31.5m solar PV installation contract by the bakery Brioche Pasquier, with the project now live. This carport project is one of the UK's largest carport systems, and positions eEnergy well to meet the strong growth in demand expected for car port solar PV products in 2026.\nThe Company is now appointed on five frameworks which are already yielding results with contracts being awarded, notably the \u00a30.5m contract with University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, won through the NHS Commercial Solutions framework. These frameworks broaden the Group's channels to market alongside its direct sales.\nSince entering the \u00a3100m funding partnership with Redaptive Inc in May 2025, eEnergy has drawn down USD$17.4m of the fund covering over 175 solar and LED projects across 179 locations and 51 customers.\nFY2025 and Outlook\nThe business is now benefiting from additional sector exposure, an expanded technology offering and a reduced reliance on direct sales with significant revenue derived from tenders. The Company has increased its participation in major frameworks and is seeing access to a growing number of larger contract opportunities, which is all consistent with the Group's strategy to pursue larger contract awards and diversifying.\nDespite significant progress made during the year, with substantial pipeline growth, the securing of several major contracts and gross margins continuing to show improvement year on year, the Group now expects approximately \u00a33m-\u00a34m of previously anticipated FY2025 revenue to be recognised in H12026. This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026. These revenues will now be incremental to FY26 and, alongside the currently secured record contracted FY26 order book of \u00a310.5m (January 2025: \u00a37.0m) and the Group's growing investment grade pipeline of opportunities created in FY2025, the Group expects a record FY2026 as outlined below.\nThe Company remains in final stage discussions with several NHS trusts awaiting decisions on NHS Energy Efficiency Fund (NEEF), which it expects decisions on by year end, with delivery on these contracts commencing in January 2026.\nAs a result of the factors outlined above, the Board now anticipates revenue for FY2025 will be between \u00a323m-\u00a324m (FY24: \u00a325.1m) depending on the value of contracts awarded and signed in the last two weeks of December this year. In addition, the Board now expects adjusted EBITDA to show material increase over the prior year (FY2024: \u00a30.6m) with a current range for FY2025 of between \u00a31.5m-\u00a31.9m, subject to the outcome of new sales awards in the remainder of the year.\nWith the expected increased run rate of new sales converting into revenue and the circa \u00a33m-4m of expected H22025 revenue now expected in H12026, the Board expects a corresponding uplift in revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA for FY2026. Given the significant quantum of contract revenues underpinning the improved FY2026 revenue and profit performance, the Board estimates H12026 revenue in the region of c.\u00a320m, double the previous year. The Board also revises guidance for FY2026 revenues and adjusted EBITDA, upgrading both by c.13% to \u00a334m and \u00a34.5m respectively.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, commented:\n\"eEnergy continues to see strong demand for its services and we are pleased to have secured several record contracts in H2 2025. Despite the continued growth in our new sales pipeline, contract signings have been delayed and we are now expecting the majority of ",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND SUCH PERSONS SHALL THEREFORE CEASE TO BE IN POSSESSION OF INSIDE INFORMATION.\n12 November 2025\neEnergy Group plc\n(\"eEnergy\", \"the Company\" or \"the Group\")\nEnlarged Solar PV supplier agreement, Loan Agreement and Grant of Warrants\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS), the net zero energy services provider,\nis pleased to announce its significant solar PV agreement, announced on 1 September 2025 has been expanded from 47 schools to potentially up to 82 schools across East and West Midlands and parts of London. The scope of the work has also been expanded to include LED, EV and battery installations as well as solar PV as part of the Great British Energy Solar Partnership (\"GBESP\"). The final designs and mix of work within the various installations at each site are yet to be finalised.\nTo meet the rapid deployment and completion deadline for the end of March 2026, the Company has today entered into an unsecured loan facility of \u00a31.5 million (\"Loan Agreement\") with Harwood Holdco Limited (\"Harwood\"). Furthermore, and in connection with this Loan Agreement, the Company has, pursuant to a warrant instrument dated 12 November 2025 (the \"Warrant Instrument\"), granted a total of 8,653,846 five-year warrants to subscribe for new ordinary shares of 0.3 pence each in the capital of the Company to Harwood.\nBackground to the Loan Agreement\nOn 1 September 2025, the Group announced that eEnergy had been selected as the preferred supplier for the Great British Energy Solar Partnership (\"GBESP\") Midlands Lot 1, to deliver eEnergy's rooftop solar PV solution to up to 47 schools in the East and West Midlands (\"the Programme\") to be managed by Mace Consult Limited\u00a0(\"Mace\") who is leading a consortium comprising\u00a0Mott Macdonald, RAFT, SOS-UK, Inspired Efficiency, Nexus, Energy Sparks, and\u00a0Building Spatial Intelligence.\nSince this announcement, the Company has been conducting structural surveys of the selected school sites and submitting applications for the necessary planning and network operator approvals ahead of the solar PV installation work at each site. The Programme is progressing well, and the Company has since been awarded an additional 35 schools increasing the total 82 schools. The Programme delivery timeline remains for completion by the end of\u00a0March 2026, and, as such, the majority of the potential revenue will be recognised in FY26.\nInstallations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\nCurrent Trading\nThe Company is trading well and subject to no significant adverse weather in the final two months which could potentially delay the solar PV installations, remains on track to deliver Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in line with market expectations. The order book for work to be delivered in FY2026 is already at a record level which positions the Company for further profitable growth in FY2026.\nDetails of the Loan Agreement\n\u00b7 \u00a31.5 million as principal (\"Loan\");\n\u00b7 The Loan is unsecured;\n\u00b7 Repayable on or before 12 November 2026 with an option to extend for a further 6 months to 12 May 2027 with a second 6 month extension option to 12 November 2027 with the agreement of Harwood; and\n\u00b7 Interest will be accrued from the date monies are drawn down under the Loan Agreement at a rate of 10 per cent. per annum, (increasing by 2.5% on each extension option) repayable at the end of the term or on prepayment of the Loan.\nDetails of the Warrant Instrument\n\u00b7 The Company has agreed to grant warrants over 8,653,846 ordinary shares of 0.3 pence each in the capital of the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") to Harwood at a strike price of 5.2 pence per Ordinary Share (the \"Warrants);\n\u00b7 The Warrants will be exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time from today until 12 November 2030 (the \"Subscription Period\");\n\u00b7 In the event that the Company raises funds by way of an equity financing round where Ordinary Shares are is",

For this Programme, Mace Consult Limited (\"Mace\") is leading a consortium comprising Mott Macdonald, RAFT, SOS-UK, Inspired Efficiency, Nexus, Energy Sparks, and Building Spatial Intelligence. The consortium was appointed as one of the programme managers to oversee Lot 1 delivery in the Midlands, which covers up to 47 schools across Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and surrounding areas.\neEnergy will now commence detailed design and planning for the first phases of the programme and will finalise contracts with each participating school and responsible body. The delivery timeline aims for completion by the end of March 2026, and as such the majority of the potential revenue will be recognised in FY26. Further announcements will be made as the programme progresses.\nThe selection for this programme strengthens eEnergy's market-leading position as the UK's largest solar and LED installer in the education sector, with over 1,200 school energy projects already completed, and is a testament to eEnergy's framework strategy working.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, commented:\n\"This is one of the UK's largest solar rollouts in education and our selection is testament to eEnergy's long-standing commitment to helping schools cut costs and carbon footprints. It marks an important milestone in our strategic pivot into public sector tenders, where our proven track record makes us a trusted delivery partner.\n\"This engagement represents our first collaboration with GBESP, beginning with the initial Lot of the national rollout and laying the foundation for a major national program. We are proud that our bid was recognised not only for technical excellence and delivering significantly more solar capacity than pre-tender designs, but also for our commitment to social value and creating a lasting legacy. Working alongside LocatED and Mace, we look forward to delivering meaningful energy and carbon savings for schools across the Midlands.\"\nMace commented:\n\"We were impressed with eEnergy's professional tender submission, the quality and comprehensive nature of their reply, and their technical design approach. eEnergy's submission showed great levels of innovation and commitment and we are looking forward to working with them to deliver the greatest possible impact for the schools involved.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, as it forms part of\u00a0UK\u00a0domestic law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris, David Asquith\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 207 920 3150\nJos Simson, Simon Hudson, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nAbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is revolutionising the path to Net Zero as a leading digital energy services provider for B2B and public sector organisations.

These results should be read in conjunction with the FY2024 Final Results announced on 30 June 2025.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nRevenue increased 67% to \u00a310.1m (H12024: \u00a36.0m*).\n\u00b7\nGross margin significantly improved to 41.6% (H12024: 19.2%*, FY2024: 34.6%*) benefitting from favourable mix of higher LED revenue and tighter control over project costs.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA** increased by \u00a32.5m to \u00a30.5m (H12024: EBITDA loss \u00a32.0m*).\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA pre-central costs increased by \u00a32.5m to \u00a31.4m (H12024: EBITDA loss \u00a31.1m*) equivalent to circa 14.4% of revenue (H12024: negative return of 18.0%).\n\u00b7\nOperational gearing improved with LED and Solar total operating costs as a % of revenue reduced to circa 27% (H12024: 37%).\n\u00b7\nCentral costs held at \u00a30.9m (H12024: \u00a30.9m).\n\u00b7\nExcept for a share-based payments charge of \u00a30.4m, there are no exceptional items to report in H12025 (H12024: \u00a32.3m; FY2024: \u00a37.6m).\n\u00b7\nSignificant cash generation in the period with a \u00a30.8m increase in cash to \u00a33.1m (31 December 2024: \u00a32.3m; 30 June 2024: \u00a36.0m).\n\u00b7\nIncluding IFRS16 liabilities, net cash increased by \u00a34.3m to \u00a31.9m in the six months to 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: net debt (\u00a32.4m); 30 June 2024: net cash \u00a35.4m) helped by Redaptive's purchase of NatWest customer related debt and the initiatives already implemented relating to cash flow.\nOperational\n\u00b7\nUnder the Redaptive partnership, Redaptive to provide funding of up to \u00a3100m for eEnergy customer projects; eEnergy established as one of Redaptive's dedicated delivery partners for the UK.\n\u00b7\n\u00a340m NatWest facility for funding public sector projects still available.\n\u00b7\nLaunch of SolarLife, a structured solar operations and maintenance service.\n\u00b7\nAppointment to five frameworks broadening channels to market alongside direct sales.\n\u00b7\nNew sales wins include \u00a30.5m Plymouth NHS Trust, \u00a30.3m Synergy MAT, and \u00a30.3m Landau Forte Trust.\n\u00b7\nAwarded Bronze sustainability rating by EcoVadis, placing the Group in the top 35% of companies assessed globally.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nGrowing sales pipeline of circa \u00a3443m gross value of which 31% (\u00a3138m) is at investment grade proposal.\n\u00b7\nSolar business continues to perform strongly with record order book of \u00a315m for H22025 and beyond at signed heads of terms or close to contract.\n\u00b7\nTrading remains in line with management expectation for FY2025.\n\u00b7\nExpect to continue to be cash generative in H22025 and for the year as a whole.\nNotes\n*H12024 comparatives exclude the impact of the Energy Management Division which was sold in February 2024 for circa \u00a325.0m in cash.\n**Adjusted EBITDA is stated before share-based payments and exceptional items (including redundancy costs) and are those items which, in the opinion of the Directors, should be excluded to provide a consistent and comparable view of the underlying performance of the Group's ongoing business.\nCommenting on the results, Harvey Sinclair, CEO, said:\n\"In the first half of the year, critically we generated positive cash flow with a \u00a30.8m increase in cash to \u00a33.1m as at 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: \u00a32.3m).\n\"We have continued to rationalise our cost base to improve our operating leverage and are at an important inflection point for our future profitability and further positive cash flow as we convert the sales pipeline.\n\"Our partnership with Redaptive provides a significant growth opportunity for eEnergy and gives us the firepower to accelerate and deliver more funded decarbonisation projects, and across every sector with better cash flow for eEnergy. The partnership is progressing well and has helped improve our cash flow. In H12025, Redaptive purchased the debt owed by NatWest customers and Redaptive is now collecting the income stream from those customers over the life of the contracts.\n\"We are optimistic about what will be an active H2 which is typically busier than H1. The Group's strong pipeline of sales opportunities, its improved participation on frameworks and a clear line of sight to significant potential business referred by Redaptive, give us confidence that trading remains in line with management expectations for FY2025.\"\nInvestor Presentation\nThere will be an online presentation, open to all existing and potential shareholders, via Investor Meet Company at 9.30am tomorrow, Wednesday 23 July 2025.

(\"Redaptive\"), the US based Energy-as-a-Service and data solutions provider.\nRedaptive will provide funding of up to \u00a3100m to support Redaptive-approved eEnergy customer projects across all client sectors in the UK, with eEnergy undertaking operational oversight of such projects and bearing responsibility for all warranty and service-related contractual obligations. The partnership establishes eEnergy as one of Redaptive's dedicated delivery partners for Redaptive-initiated projects in the UK.\nRedaptive is a leading Energy-as-a-Service provider in the US that rapidly funds and installs energy-saving and energy-generating equipment across its clients' real estate portfolios. Redaptive was founded in 2015, is headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and its clients include T-Mobile, WPT Capital Advisors, Novolex, Cintas, Saint-Gobain, Iron Mountain and many more. To date, Redaptive has completed a number of projects in the UK but is looking to expand coverage.\nWorking together to deliver decarbonisation projects, eEnergy's leading UK market presence in large scale LED and solar installations will enable Redaptive to expand its business footprint in the UK at a faster scale, whilst providing incremental business to eEnergy with the opportunity to project manage and deliver LED and solar projects on behalf of Redaptive's customer base across Europe.\nWhilst eEnergy's NatWest facility, which will be retained to maximise eEnergy's flexibility going forwards, is restricted to solely public sector projects, the Redaptive partnership allows eEnergy to harmonise a one-funder approach for customers across the public and private sectors in the UK and will be available to both Redaptive and non-Redaptive funded projects.\nIn addition, a key benefit for eEnergy of the Redaptive partnership is that the affected projects are fully funded such that eEnergy receives 100% of the net revenue in cash on completion, thereby significantly improving cash flow for eEnergy.\nHarvey Sinclair, eEnergy CEO, comments:\n\"This is a game-changing partnership. Redaptive's decision to provide up to \u00a3100m unlocks a massive growth opportunity for eEnergy, giving us the firepower to deliver more funded decarbonisation projects, faster, and across every sector. As their lead UK delivery partner, we're not just accessing capital - we're joining forces with a global player to deliver scale. This enables us to accelerate our mission, remove financial barriers, and bring clean energy solutions to more organisations on their path to Net Zero than ever before.\"\nJoe Bell, Redaptive Partnerships & International Strategy Leader, comments:\n\"By leveraging our combined expertise, innovative technologies, and industry know-how, our companies have joined forces to achieve a shared vision: empowering organisations to accelerate their sustainability, energy efficiency, and carbon reduction goals with ease and at scale. With eEnergy as a partner, we are now positioned to accelerate our mission and help more organisations overcome the barriers to energy efficiency and carbon reduction across the UK.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nand\nhttps://redaptive.com/\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 7078 9564\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris, David Asquith\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 20 7920 3150\nJos Simson, Simon Hudson, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nAbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is revolutionising the path to Net Zero as a leading digital energy services provider for B2B and public sector organisations.

Secured through the NHS Commercial Solutions framework, the project is further evidence of eEnergy's successful public sector framework strategy.\nThe project will see eEnergy deliver a full LED lighting upgrade across 19 wards at Plymouth Derriford Hospital. Working closely with the Trust, eEnergy supported the application and successful drawdown of NEEF funding - part of the new Great British Energy public sector finance initiative - to unlock investment in energy efficiency.\nDelivery will take place in a live, occupied hospital environment, with eEnergy's experienced project teams collaborating with hospital staff to minimise disruption while improving patient and staff environments and cutting energy waste.\nIn addition, eEnergy has been awarded a Bronze sustainability rating by EcoVadis, placing the Group in the top 35% of companies assessed globally. This independent accreditation strengthens eEnergy's credentials as a transparent, responsible partner in the eyes of public sector buyers, who are placing increasing emphasis on ESG performance across their supply chains.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, commented:\n\"Delivering this project with Plymouth NHS Trust marks another proud moment in our growing success across the healthcare sector. As the UK accelerates the decarbonisation of its public estate, we're proving that energy efficiency upgrades can be delivered with minimal disruption, maximum impact, and without upfront cost.\n\"Being awarded a Bronze rating by EcoVadis is a strong endorsement of our commitment to Net Zero and responsible business.

SolarLife delivers that confidence-ensuring solar installations perform at their peak, minimise downtime, and continue delivering strong financial and environmental value for years to come.\n\"We strongly support Great British Energy's plan to install rooftop solar on schools and NHS sites across the UK. But the real value of this initiative won't come from installation alone-it will come from how these assets are managed over time. Without proactive monitoring and lifecycle care, systems risk underperforming and falling short of their potential, especially in public sector environments already facing stretched maintenance budgets.\n\"That's why SolarLife matters. It ensures the government's initial investment pays back over the full asset life-through reliable performance, extended lifespan, and continuous energy savings. For asset owners, that means greater energy security, lower costs, and faster progress to Net Zero.\"\nSolarLife further cements eEnergy's position as a\nleading end-to-end solar solutions provider\n, offering design, installation, funding, and now full lifecycle management under one roof.\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 207 920 3150\nJos Simson, Simon Hudson, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nAbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is revolutionising the path to Net Zero as a leading digital energy services provider for B2B and public sector organisations.

Its LED Lighting Framework offers a compliant, competitive procurement route to access specialist providers with deep sector knowledge and proven delivery.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, commented:\n\"The contract wins with Landau Forte Trust and Synergy Multi Academy Trust highlight the strength of our delivery, the power of our relationships, and the confidence clients have in our funded model. Being awarded a third site by Landau Forte Trust showcases how eEnergy builds trust in our client base and the results we deliver. Having worked with a member of the Synergy Multi Academy Trust board in a previous role, the new partnership is a great example of our reputation following us.\n\u200b\n\"Being appointed to the LASER Framework is a testament to eEnergy's position as a trusted Net Zero delivery partner. This inclusion not only strengthens our reach within the public sector, particularly in education and the NHS, but also underscores our credentials and compliance to operate effectively in this sector. This appointment opens up a significant pipeline of opportunities, enhancing our market presence and supporting our growth strategy.\n\"The Company is also pleased to note Great British Energy's announcement regarding its first major project, installing rooftop solar panels on approximately 200 schools and 200 NHS sites across the UK. This initiative perfectly aligns with our mission at eEnergy and exemplifies how we can eliminate energy waste and make Net Zero not just achievable, but profitable for public sector organisations. It is the kind of transformative action we champion, showing that with the right approach, we can make clean energy work for everyone's bottom line.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavist",

The Board is confident of a positive EBITDA result for H12025, which is typically a weaker period of trading compared to the second half of the year, driven in part by operational efficiencies and tighter cost controls. As a result, the Board is confident that the business will deliver significantly improved EBITDA and cash generation in FY2025.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report a return to strong growth for eEnergy. We have demonstrated our ability to grow revenue, improve gross margin and generate a significantly improved underlying financial performance.\nThe strong finish to the year saw a successful appointment to the\u00a0NHS\u00a0Commercial Solutions Sustainable Estates Framework Agreement and the signing of a \u00a3975,000\u00a0contract with\u00a0Newcastle College Group\u00a0to deliver a full LED lighting conversion across ten buildings in\u00a0Newcastle\u00a0and\u00a0Carlisle in November 2024. This is evidence of eEnergy's strategy to accelerate energy efficiency solutions through frameworks, competitive tenders and reducing sales cycles, while extending our market leading reach within the education sector to include the university segment.\nWe start FY2025 with a debt free balance sheet, a record forward order book, a strengthened operational management team, a reduced cost base and are more focused than ever on improving gross margin and cash generation.\nWe are market leaders in our sector serving education and healthcare organisations and are well placed to drive further significant growth.

With over 70% of schools yet to transition to LED lighting and over 90% yet to deploy solar, eEnergy estimates that at least \u00a35.4 billion would need to be invested to install adequate rooftop solar, LED lighting, and EV charging infrastructure in UK schools.\n-ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In addition, Q1 24 trading was impacted by a constrained balance sheet prior to the Energy Management Division disposal and weak market conditions, resulting in a slow start to the year as previously guided. Market conditions improved during the Period and H2 24 has started with strong momentum which, together with a robust contracted forward order book, enables the Group to maintain full year revenue guidance at \u00a325-26m.\nSummary\n\u25cf\nH1 24 Core Revenue(1) of \u00a36.2m (pro forma(2) H1 23 \u00a311.0m)\n\u25cf\nH1 24 Core Adjusted EBITDA(1) loss of \u00a3(2.1)m (pro forma(2) H1 23 \u00a30.5m)\n\u25cf\n\u00a35.2 million solar contract signed with Spire Healthcare plc, the Group's largest to date\n\u25cf\nUp to \u00a340m project funding facility with National Westminster Bank Plc (the \"NatWest Facility\") to finance energy efficiency and onsite generation technologies for the Group's public sector customers\n\u25cf\nSales pipeline growth has been strong in the Period (pipeline up 25% in the period)\n\u25cf\nH2 24 revenues underpinned by contracted forward order book at 19 July - \u00a312.9m expected to convert to revenue during H2 24 (pro forma(2) H1 23 \u00a38.7m), comprising 75% of forecast H2 24 Solar revenues and 44% of forecast H2 24 LED revenues\n\u25cf\nH2 24 started with strong momentum, with positive signs of market recovery\n\u25cf\nInterim accounts expected to reflect an exceptional adjustment to the balance sheet following a full review of the Group structure and balance sheet, implemented following the sale of the Energy Management Division\n\u25cf\nNick Clark appointed to new role of Chief Operating Officer\nNote (1): Core Revenue and Core Adjusted EBITDA relate to the underlying revenues and earnings of the continuing operations of the Group for the period. They exclude amounts related to the Energy Management Division, including pre-completion revenues and costs, and the accounting treatment of the disposal. They are stated before share-based payments and exceptional items. Exceptional items are those items which, in the opinion of the Directors, should be excluded in order to provide a consistent and comparable view of the underlying performance of the Group's ongoing business and include transaction-related items, restructuring and integration costs.\nNote (2): 'pro forma' means on a like-for-like basis, adjusted for the sale of the Energy Management Division.\nQ1 24 was a period where the business continued to be hampered by a weak balance sheet. As previously highlighted, this was exacerbated by weak market conditions, driven by lower energy prices and higher costs of finance which saw lengthened customer decision-making cycles, culminating in a delay in contract signings. However, following the disposal of the Energy Management Division (\"Disposal\") and with the new NatWest Facility, the Group's balance sheet has been significantly strengthened, providing working capital for growth.\nMarket conditions have improved during the Period and the business has entered H2 24 with a robust contracted forward order book of which \u00a312.9m is expected to convert to revenue in H2 24, comprising 75% of forecast H2 24 Solar revenues and 44% of forecast H2 24 LED revenues. This high level of contracted revenue gives the Board confidence in the underlying trading for the continuing business for the full year FY24.\nDuring the Period the Group completed on the Disposal for \u00a329.3m. The net proceeds from the Disposal are being used to reinvest into the Company's high growth Energy Services Division and all the Group's previous debt facilities of \u00a38.1m have now been repaid. Following the Disposal, which has necessitated carving out a standalone accounting system at the same time as completing an ERP implementation and building independent infrastructure and platforms, management have taken the opportunity to restructure the continuing Group in order to build a strong foundation to drive long-term, scalable revenue and earnings growth with improving margins. This restructure has identified a number of items which management are proposing to adjust for in the interim accounts. As a result, the interim accounts are currently expected to reflect an adjustment to the balance sheet of up to \u00a32.5m which management consider to be exceptional items and therefore excluded from adjusted earnings.\nIn addition to these anticipated exceptional items, exceptional costs in the period will reflect the costs of executing the Disposal as well as the separation and restructuring of the continuing business post-completion.\nThe Company expects to report its interim results during the second half of Sep",

The Facility has been designed exclusively for the funding of public sector energy transition projects across the full range of eEnergy products. The Facility will be deployed through a newly-formed special purpose vehicle (\"SPV\") owned by eEnergy, with eEnergy becoming the operator and retaining ownership and interest in the economics of each completed project.\nThe Facility is available for a period of 12 years with investment planned over the first 24 months. The Facility is split into two equal tranches to match the expected profile of drawdowns and optimise fees. The second tranche will become available to draw-down once 75% of the first tranche has been deployed, subject to customary final approvals.\nThe Board believes that this new Facility gives eEnergy a unique, compliant off balance sheet solution for public sector customers and will strengthen eEnergy's competitive position in tendering for large multi-site contracts. The Facility will lower eEnergy's cost of capital, delivering an attractive financial return on the retained project interests.\nLongspur Capital acted as eEnergy's sole financial advisor in relation to the Facility.\nTrading Update\nTrading in the 6-month period ended 31 December 2023 was impacted by the Group's balance sheet constraints which have now been alleviated as a result of the sale of the Energy Management division. In addition, management have chosen to re-profile solar project revenue and adjust the FY23 results for the Energy Management division in relation to its subsequent disposal. As a result, the Board expects, subject to completion of the audit process, to report\nGroup Revenues for 18-months ended 31 December 2023 of \u00a346 million with Adjusted EBITDA of \u00a35.1 million - \u00a35.3 million.\nThe completion of the disposal of the Energy Management division after the period-end has enabled the Group to repay all borrowings, substantially strengthen its balance sheet and refocus resources on delivering on the growth opportunities in the Energy Services division.\nThe Company expects the annual audited accounts for the 18 months to 31 December 2023 to be released in the last week of April 2024.\nHarvey Sinclair, eEnergy CEO, comments:\n\"\nWe are extremely pleased to announce this \u00a340m Facility with NatWest, marking the beginning of a new collaboration between our two organisations. This Facility is the result of significant investment in honing our proposition to public sector customers and gives eEnergy a clear competitive advantage in the market. It also allows us to offer our leading net zero energy efficiency services to larger multi-site projects and contracts. This Facility has been structured to allow us to scale rapidly in a large addressable UK market.\n\"What is particularly exciting about this new Facility is its innovative structure which will lower our cost of capital and also provide us with longer-term economic upside on each project.\n\"We look forward to this new relationship with NatWest which we hope is a start of a much longer-term relationship given the opportunities available.\"\nJacob Lloyd, Head of Specialist Asset Finance at NatWest, comments:\n\"NatWest is delighted to be able to support eEnergy by acting as Structuring Bank & Hedge Counterparty for this innovative financing. We look forward to working with the eEnergy team going forward as they execute their contract pipeline and assist the public sector with deploying energy efficiency and decarbonisation assets.\"\nInvestor Presentation\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO, and Crispin Goldsmith, CFO, will be hosting an online presentation for investors on the 7th March 2024, to provide an investor update on the Group following the sale of the Energy Management division. Presentations will be held via the Investor Meet Company platform at 11:00, and the Equity Development platform at 15:00.

Additional contingent consideration, expected to be between \u00a38 million and \u00a310 million, will also be due to the Company, based on the trading performance of the Energy Management Division for the period to 30 September 2025.\nThe Company has now received the Initial Cash Consideration of \u00a325 million and the remaining \u00a34.3 million of initial consideration (reflecting the financial position of the Energy Management Division at completion) has been used to repay amounts due from the Group to the Energy Management Division. As previously announced, the net proceeds from the Disposal will be used to reinvest into the Company's high growth energy services division and pay down all the Group's external debt facilities of \u00a38.1 million, comprising the \u00a35.0 million HSBC Innovation Finance (previously known as Silicon Valley Bank) revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") and the \u00a32.525 million secured discounted capital bonds (\"Bonds\") provided by FFIH Limited (\u00a31 million)), Hawk Investment Holdings Limited (\u00a31 million) and directors and previous directors (\u00a30.525 million) together, in the case of the RCF, with interest accrued, and, in the case of the Bonds, with an early settlement discount, as well as for general working capital purposes.\nCapitalised terms in this announcement shall have the same meaning as in the Company's announcement of the Disposal on 22 January 2024, unless the context provides otherwise.\nBoard Changes\nThe Company is pleased to announce a board restructuring to reflect the simplified business and the Company's focus on its core energy services division going forward.\nFollowing completion of the Disposal and with repayment of the Bonds to FFIH Limited and Hawk Investment Holdings Limited, John Foley, Non-Executive Chair, who is a shareholder and director of FFIH is stepping down from the board, and Andrew Lawley, currently Non-Executive Director, has been appointed Non-Executive Chair, each with immediate effect.\nIn addition, David Nicholl, Non-Executive Director, is stepping down from the board, effective immediately. David will, however, remains as an adviser to the board given his experience and technology sector knowledge.\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that John Hornby is joining the eEnergy board as Non-Executive Director with immediate effect. John is Chief Executive Officer of Luceco plc which, following its strategic investment into the Company in November 2023, holds an interest in 9.96% of eEnergy's issued shares. John originally joined Luceco in 1997 and led the management buyout of the company in 2000 as well as the secondary buyout with EPIC Investment Partners LLP (formerly EPIC Private Equity LLP) in 2005, in his capacity as CEO at that time. John began his career with Knox D'Arcy Management Consultants following his graduation from the University of Oxford where he obtained a degree in Economics.\nHarvey Sinclair, eEnergy CEO, comments:\n\"I am very pleased to announce the completion of the Disposal which unlocks value for shareholders and significantly strengthens our balance sheet so that we can focus our resources on our fast-growing energy services business. Andrew Lawley will continue to provide his advice and expertise to the board, now as Chair.

The New Awards will work alongside the existing Management Incentive Plan (\"2020 MIP\")\nimplemented and announced in July 2020.\nIn mid-2023, the independent Non-executive Directors recognised the need to restructure the Company's existing equity incentive structure to ensure it remained effective and appropriate in the light of the prevailing circumstances, and outlook. The economic terms of the New Awards were agreed in principle during the Summer, taking into account the Company's share price which was below 5p at that time. The Company has not, however, been in a position to implement the New Awards until today due to being in closed periods for the majority of that time.\nThe New Awards are being made to four Directors of the Company, as detailed below, together with an amount reserved for several members of the senior management team expected to be allocated in the coming weeks. The New Awards are subject to achieving a minimum vesting threshold share price of 9.32p. The share price performance target will be tested three years from award in January 2027, by reference to the average closing mid-price over the prior 30 days and would vest at that time only to the extent the share performance targets had been met.\nThe terms of the existing 2020 MIP awards, which reward shareholder value creation delivered in the four years following grant in July 2020, remain unchanged. Harvey Sinclair, David Nicholl and Andrew Lawley hold awards under the 2020 MIP. Any awards which vest under the 2020 MIP will reduce the number of New Awards for those awardees that could vest on a one-for-one basis. The New Awards therefore represent the maximum total awards under both schemes. The total number of awards under all schemes that could vest is capped at 14.0% of the enlarged shares following issue.\nThe New Awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.\nThe number of options over which awards vest may be reduced by the Board if it fairly and reasonably considers that the level of vesting is not justified by the underlying financial performance of the Company.\nOn a change of control, the Remuneration Committee (excluding any awardees) will determine the level of any vesting based on the extent to which any exercise conditions for individuals have been met.\nThe number of New Awards being made to Directors of the Company are set out in the table below. The share price targets range from threshold vesting at 9.32p with maximum vesting at 18.4p with straight-line vesting between agreed midpoints.\nNumber of New Awards\n9.32p\n(minimum vesting)\n13.00p\n15.80p\n18.40p (maximum award)\nHarvey Sinclair\n18,130,000\n22,500,000\n25,800,000\n28,080,000\nCrispin Goldsmith*\n6,000,000\n7,500,000\n8,000,000\n8,000,000\nAndrew Lawley\n2,780,000\n3,400,000\n4,000,000\n5,500,000\nDavid Nicholl\n2,780,000\n3,400,000\n4,000,000\n5,500,000\nOther employees (to be allocated)\n3,270,000\n7,160,000\n9,170,000\n9,170,000\nTotal\n32,960,000\n43,960,000\n50,970,000\n56,250,000\n* in respect of Crispin Goldsmith's New Awards, 3,350,000 awards are EMI-qualifying with the balance being non EMI-qualifying.\nIn addition, it is intended that, subject to completion of the sale of the Energy Management Services division, announced earlier today, one-off success bonuses will be awarded to Harvey Sinclair and Crispin Goldsmith in the amounts of \u00a3285,000 and \u00a3200,000, respectively (\"Transaction Bonuses\"). These amounts include any discretionary performance bonuses payable for the 6-month period to December 2023.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe New Awards to Harvey Sinclair, Crispin Goldsmith, Andrew Lawley and David Nicholl and Transaction Bonuses to Harvey Sinclair and Crispin Goldsmith are considered to be related party transactions for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. Nigel Burton and Gary Worby, who are members of the Remuneration Committee, will not receive New Awards, and do not participate in the 2020 MIP and will not receive a Transaction Bonus and are therefore considered to be independent directors for this purpose, consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser,\u00a0Strand Hanson Limited, that the terms of the New Awards and Transaction Bonuses to the above Directors are fair and reasonable insofar as the shareholders of eEnergy are concerned. Andrew Lawley\u00a0and\u00a0David Nicholl, who are both receiving New Awards and hold 2020 MIP Shares, have not participated in the deliberations of the Remuneration Committee on the terms of the New Awards.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Ar",

Once approved by Shareholders, the Transaction will unlock significant immediate cash for eEnergy and give the opportunity to deliver significant additional value to shareholders through the Earnout Period. Whilst Energy Management is the smaller by revenue of our two divisions, the initial transaction proceeds alone will be c. 90% of eEnergy's current market capitalisation.\n\"The sale of\nthe Energy Management Division\nwill allow us to focus entirely on our similar sized, high growth Energy Services Division which grew 87% in the past 12 month period despite being undercapitalised. The sale will simplify our business, strengthen our balance sheet and will bring the opportunity to invest further in the higher growth segments of Solar and EV Charging across the UK.\n\"I would like to thank our colleagues in the Energy Management Division. They will have an excellent new owner in Flogas who is in an ideal position to take the business forward.\"\nIvan Trevor, Managing Director, Flogas Britain comments:\n\"Flogas are delighted to welcome the Energy Management Division of eEnergy Group plc\u00a0to DCC Energy. Together with Certas and the recent acquisitions of Protech, Centreco and DTGen, this acquisition further expands our capability in energy management services, providing a comprehensive range of products and services to partner with our customers on their journey to Net Zero and supporting our ambition to halve the carbon emissions of the energy we supply by 2030. \"\nBackground to the Transaction\nAs announced on 8 November 2023, in early 2023, the Board received a number of unsolicited approaches expressing an interest in acquiring the Energy Management Division.

The contract with Symphony Healthcare Services Limited (a subsidiary of Somerset NHS Foundation Trust) covers LED lighting upgrades across 18 GP surgeries, with a total contract value of c\u00a30.7 million, and will be delivered across Somerset (South West England).\nBacked by Redaptive, this new, unique, funding solution enables eEnergy to install the energy-savings systems at the customers sites, whilst the customer pays for the equipment from energy savings or total use rather than as an upfront payment. eEnergy retains operational responsibility for the installed equipment, supporting service-style treatment.\nThe EPC funding structure is a first of its kind in the UK, a much needed solution for the NHS that is expected to be transformational for NHS organisations. Developed in response to recent IFRS accounting rule changes, this solution has been specifically designed to help NHS bodies overcome IFRS 16 related on balance sheet considerations.\nThis EPC is available to all organisations and businesses and is specifically designed for the UK public sector. The solution has been specifically structured to address key barriers that can slow adoption of energy transition and on-site generation in the public sector.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, said:\n\"The challenge is unlocking fast delivery without consuming scarce capital or creating unwanted balance-sheet complexity. While Great British Energy is expected to support projects across the UK healthcare and education sectors, many NHS Trusts remain constrained in accessing at pace proven technologies such as LED lighting, Solar PV, and EV charging. Our EPC solution is designed to address this gap and remove barriers faced by NHS organisations.\n\"At eEnergy, we are constantly exploring new and innovative ways to help organisations accelerate their net zero journey. This new solution strengthens our ability to deliver energy-saving projects without incurring upfront cost, helping more clients reduce consumption, cut costs, and achieve their sustainability goals. Combined with the Group's multiple public sector framework awards, it positions eEnergy to help accelerate delivery of NHS decarbonisation programmes.\n\"Winning our first EPC-funded contract with Symphony Healthcare Services Limited is an important validation. It demonstrates clear appetite for an NHS-ready solution and provides a platform to scale LED programmes today while supporting a broader pathway to Solar PV and EV infrastructure.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris, David Asquith\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 20 7920 3150\nJos Simson, Nick Dibden, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nA\nbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is a UK-based Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) provider, funding and delivering energy-saving and energy-generating solutions across multi-site public sector and commercial portfolios-helping customers cut energy waste, reduce operating costs, and improve building resilience with zero upfront cost.\neEnergy delivers four core solutions:\n\u00b7\nReduce\n: LED lighting and controls\n\u00b7\nGenerate\n: Solar PV (rooftop, ground mount, and carport)\n\u00b7\nStore\n: Battery storage (store onsite generation and reduce peak-time import costs)\n\u00b7\nCharge\n: EV charging infrastructure and management\nProjects are funded through dedicated facilities, including up to \u00a3100m of project funding via eEnergy's partnership with Redaptive, and a \u00a340m NatWest facility supporting public sector deployments.\neEnergy's routes to market include direct sales, public sector frameworks, tenders, and strategic partnerships.

Also, whilst EAAS rarely do trading updates outside H1 and YE guidance things have been quiet since the H1 numbers were announced in late July. This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty. My rule of thumb over the last year or so, which has worked quite well,  has been to top up below 5p and make a quick (ish) 20% plus, however, i am not sure whether i want to put more into this until i know a bit more. I'm not 100% convinced by the CEO but the new CFO looks really focused on driving value and improving margins etc. Thoughts of others greatly appreciated!",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025).

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

I noticed on Wednesday that there were several 50k and 150k trades that seemed to be buys but LSE marked them as unknown (adding up to over \u00a330K).  I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .  The bid/offer spread has also been very tight over the last few days with the price difference between buys and sells being around 0.05p. This morning there were around \u00a320K of uncounted buys and a \u00a312.39k buy at 14:10, but the price still dropped! I finally bought into EAAS today at 4.5p as buys have exceeded sells for a few days straight and yet the price has fallen.  Maybe I've bought in too soon, but I'm hoping I've bought near the short-term bottom and EAAS is ready to bounce back next week.  This after hours trade also gives me hope that the price has finally bottomed. 28-Nov-25\t16:42:41\t4.55\t897,000\tBuy*\t4.40\t4.50\t40.81k\tO",

These panel appointments take a long time to bed in - once you get a couple and they go well word spreads quickly. They are in a fast growing and essential market and are incredibly active (check out their LinkedIn posts). Been burnt badly many times but in my view we are in for some fun years and in a critical sector for the environment",

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

It's not actually clear to me what the \"buy\" recommendation is for here. eEnergy, an energy services provider that designs and implements energy-efficient projects (solar, electric vehicle charging and lighting), has been selected as preferred supplier to design, supply, install and commission rooftop solar photovoltaic systems for up to 47 schools in the Midlands. It is one of the UK\u2019s largest solar rollouts across the education sector and the group\u2019s first collaboration with Great British Energy Solar Partnership, a testament to eEnergy\u2019s long-standing commitment to helping schools cut costs and carbon footprints. It also marks an important milestone in the strategic pivot into public sector tenders, and strengthens eEnergy\u2019s market-leading position as the UK\u2019s largest solar and LED installer in the education sector. To date, the group has completed more than 1,200 school energy projects. eEnergy will now commence detailed design and planning for the first phases of the programme, and will finalise contracts with each participating school and responsible body. The delivery timeline aims for completion by the end of March 2026, so the bulk of revenue will be recognised in the 2026 financial year. The contract adds substance to house broker Canaccord Genuity\u2019s forecast of a 41 per cent increase in group operating profit to \u00a33.6mn next year, which underpins a doubling of adjusted pre-tax profit to \u00a32mn. On this basis, the shares trade on a forward price/earnings (PE) ratio of 15. However, next year\u2019s forecasts are based on 10 per cent growth in revenue to \u00a330.8mn, a conservative-looking estimate assuming contract momentum continues to build. That looks a real possibility given that eEnergy has entered a partnership with Redaptive, a US-based energy-as-a-service and data solutions provider, which establishes the group as a dedicated delivery partner for Redaptive-initiated projects in the UK. Redaptive is not only providing up to \u00a3100mn of funding to support approved projects across the UK, but the partnership should generate material referral opportunities through Redaptive\u2019s US customer base with UK-based operations. Importantly, Redaptive fully funds the customer project, eEnergy receives 100 per cent of the project\u2019s net revenue (revenue excluding the interest costs billed to the customer as part of the cost the customer sees) and the customer then pays Redaptive over the life of the project. The new finding arrangements support a marked improvement in eEnergy\u2019s cash generation, as highlighted by analysts\u2019 net cash (excluding IFRS16 lease liabilities) estimates of \u00a33.6mn (2025) and \u00a35mn (2026), a healthy sum in relation to its market capitalisation of \u00a323.6mn....",

          "content": "....The strategic pivot in the group\u2019s business model and funding has not gone unnoticed as eEnergy\u2019s share price has rallied 58 per cent since I highlighted their significance (\u2018New funding could be a game-changer for this energy stock\u2019, IC, 2 July 2025), albeit it is still adrift of the suggested entry point (7.2p) in my 2024 Bargain Shares Portfolio. I can see potential for a re-rating towards Canaccord\u2019s fair valuation of 12p, or double the current share price. Clearly, Oryx International Growth Fund (OIG: 1,375p), a small-cap fund managed by Harwood Capital, sees value in the shares, having just snapped up a 4.56 per cent stake from shareholder Derek Myers, so clearing a stock overhang. Myers no longer has an interest in the shares. Managed by Nick Mills of investment firm Harwood Capital Management, the \u00a3262mn closed-end fund has trebled net asset value (NAV) per share over the past decade. By providing strategic leadership and operational expertise, Harwood\u2019s advisers maintain a close relationship with the management of the 42 UK small-cap companies in Oryx\u2019s concentrated portfolio, a hands-on approach that enhances investment returns. Oryx shares have rallied 14 per cent since I last highlighted the investment case (\u2018A small-cap fund offering strong upside potential\u2019, IC, 15 July 2025) and are trading back at my entry point (\u2018Alpha Research: Ride a small-cap recovery wave\u2019, IC, 14 May 2024). However, they are still priced on a 27 per cent discount to NAV \u2013 an unwarranted five percentage point discount to the five-year average. Buy.",

Also, whilst EAAS rarely do trading updates outside H1 and YE guidance things have been quiet since the H1 numbers were announced in late July. This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty. My rule of thumb over the last year or so, which has worked quite well,  has been to top up below 5p and make a quick (ish) 20% plus, however, i am not sure whether i want to put more into this until i know a bit more. I'm not 100% convinced by the CEO but the new CFO looks really focused on driving value and improving margins etc. Thoughts of others greatly appreciated!",

The loan is a slight concern - high % and also mates rates warrants, however, as govt contracts the payment terms are longer than standard - so more money is paid upfront by EAAS and revenues take longer to arrive. As original loan is only for 12 months EAAS must feel it is just a short term  solution to avoid a cashflow bottleneck.",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025).

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

To start with 2025 YE numbers need to be hit, or be close to (\u00a328m rev and \u00a33m EBITDA i think). This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.

The fact he's gone immediately to zero perhaps indicates he needed the money ASAP (and perhaps also that a buyer was available). At c4.25p a share he could have clearly got a better price if he had waited. Definitely better for us that he's gone.

          "content": "Latest piece from ST.  It's not actually clear to me what the \"buy\" recommendation is for here. eEnergy, an energy services provider that designs and implements energy-efficient projects (solar, electric vehicle charging and lighting), has been selected as preferred supplier to design, supply, install and commission rooftop solar photovoltaic systems for up to 47 schools in the Midlands. It is one of the UK\u2019s largest solar rollouts across the education sector and the group\u2019s first collaboration with Great British Energy Solar Partnership, a testament to eEnergy\u2019s long-standing commitment to helping schools cut costs and carbon footprints. It also marks an important milestone in the strategic pivot into public sector tenders, and strengthens eEnergy\u2019s market-leading position as the UK\u2019s largest solar and LED installer in the education sector. To date, the group has completed more than 1,200 school energy projects. eEnergy will now commence detailed design and planning for the first phases of the programme, and will finalise contracts with each participating school and responsible body. The delivery timeline aims for completion by the end of March 2026, so the bulk of revenue will be recognised in the 2026 financial year. The contract adds substance to house broker Canaccord Genuity\u2019s forecast of a 41 per cent increase in group operating profit to \u00a33.6mn next year, which underpins a doubling of adjusted pre-tax profit to \u00a32mn. On this basis, the shares trade on a forward price/earnings (PE) ratio of 15. However, next year\u2019s forecasts are based on 10 per cent growth in revenue to \u00a330.8mn, a conservative-looking estimate assuming contract momentum continues to build. That looks a real possibility given that eEnergy has entered a partnership with Redaptive, a US-based energy-as-a-service and data solutions provider, which establishes the group as a dedicated delivery partner for Redaptive-initiated projects in the UK. Redaptive is not only providing up to \u00a3100mn of funding to support approved projects across the UK, but the partnership should generate material referral opportunities through Redaptive\u2019s US customer base with UK-based operations. Importantly, Redaptive fully funds the customer project, eEnergy receives 100 per cent of the project\u2019s net revenue (revenue excluding the interest costs billed to the customer as part of the cost the customer sees) and the customer then pays Redaptive over the life of the project. The new finding arrangements support a marked improvement in eEnergy\u2019s cash generation, as highlighted by analysts\u2019 net cash (excluding IFRS16 lease liabilities) estimates of \u00a33.6mn (2025) and \u00a35mn (2026), a healthy sum in relation to its market capitalisation of \u00a323.6mn....",

I can see potential for a re-rating towards Canaccord\u2019s fair valuation of 12p, or double the current share price. Clearly, Oryx International Growth Fund (OIG: 1,375p), a small-cap fund managed by Harwood Capital, sees value in the shares, having just snapped up a 4.56 per cent stake from shareholder Derek Myers, so clearing a stock overhang. Myers no longer has an interest in the shares. Managed by Nick Mills of investment firm Harwood Capital Management, the \u00a3262mn closed-end fund has trebled net asset value (NAV) per share over the past decade. By providing strategic leadership and operational expertise, Harwood\u2019s advisers maintain a close relationship with the management of the 42 UK small-cap companies in Oryx\u2019s concentrated portfolio, a hands-on approach that enhances investment returns. Oryx shares have rallied 14 per cent since I last highlighted the investment case (\u2018A small-cap fund offering strong upside potential\u2019, IC, 15 July 2025) and are trading back at my entry point (\u2018Alpha Research: Ride a small-cap recovery wave\u2019, IC, 14 May 2024). However, they are still priced on a 27 per cent discount to NAV \u2013 an unwarranted five percentage point discount to the five-year average. Buy.",

With 2025 YE guidance of \u00a328m and with \u00a310m recorded in H1 we need a similar H2 performance so the outlook statement is key.",

The sp just wasn't budging today despite a 4:1 ratio of buys vs sells for most of the day, still ending well up on the buy side. Someone is obviously selling and their sells aren't showing. I guess it could be Myers? If he's gone to the States there's your reason. This has been on my watchlist for a while. Got a lot going for it.  Don't think it will take too long for an update.",

Doing some googling Inspired was sold in Aug 2025 for \u00a3183.6m. It's 2024 accounts had revenues of \u00a393m, EBITDA of \u00a323m and PBT of \u00a311.8m. It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.  So this would equate to a valuation of c\u00a345m or 12p a share.",

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

From 2025 to 2026 there should be \u00a311m extra revenue and they have used a conservative 30% margin to generate \u00a33.3m on top of the \u00a31.7m EBITDA made in 2025. So there is the \u00a35m. He did say he's then taken 500k off to cover additional costs, but this seems to be a vague figure to keep  things conservative. So i interpret it as report \u00a34.5m but expect more. As they are not very good at hitting their own targets, quite a sensible approach. EAAS will eventually get things right, hopefully 2026 will be the year.",

          "content": "Not quite. 2025 revenues were forecast to be \u00a328m and only on 12/11 we were told this was on target with the caveat being adverse weather conditions could delay installations. Then barely 4 weeks later on 15/12 we get told that \u00a33 to \u00a34m of revenue would be pushed into 2026 due to delays in installation AND contract signings being delayed. So clearly the Nov RNS was misleading as not all the 2025 revenue had been formally contracted. Also the weather hadn't been that bad in Nov/Dec so the weather delays shouldn't have been an issue. Now \u00a34m has been pushed into 2026 but 2025 revenue has reduced by \u00a35m - the \u00a31m difference i referred to. This seems to have been missed by some including sharp eyed Tricky. So 2025 will be a YoY revenue reduction despite EAAS being in the middle of a growth sector and whilst an EBITDA increase is good, it will still result in a full year loss for the year, as clearly EBITDA is not profit. This follows big losses in 2023 and 2024. After the sell of EMD for \u00a325m in Jan 2024 we had \u00a317m in the bank after paying off \u00a38m debts. We now have c\u00a32m so that's a big reduction. Yes 2026 look a lot more promising for EAAS but they need to hit their own targets and be honest with RNSs.",

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

I noticed on Wednesday that there were several 50k and 150k trades that seemed to be buys but LSE marked them as unknown (adding up to over \u00a330K).  I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .  The bid/offer spread has also been very tight over the last few days with the price difference between buys and sells being around 0.05p. This morning there were around \u00a320K of uncounted buys and a \u00a312.39k buy at 14:10, but the price still dropped! I finally bought into EAAS today at 4.5p as buys have exceeded sells for a few days straight and yet the price has fallen.  Maybe I've bought in too soon, but I'm hoping I've bought near the short-term bottom and EAAS is ready to bounce back next week.  This after hours trade also gives me hope that the price has finally bottomed. 28-Nov-25\t16:42:41\t4.55\t897,000\tBuy*\t4.40\t4.50\t40.81k\tO",

To start with 2025 YE numbers need to be hit, or be close to (\u00a328m rev and \u00a33m EBITDA i think). This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025).

The loan is a slight concern - high % and also mates rates warrants, however, as govt contracts the payment terms are longer than standard - so more money is paid upfront by EAAS and revenues take longer to arrive.

Also, whilst EAAS rarely do trading updates outside H1 and YE guidance things have been quiet since the H1 numbers were announced in late July. This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty. My rule of thumb over the last year or so, which has worked quite well,  has been to top up below 5p and make a quick (ish) 20% plus, however, i am not sure whether i want to put more into this until i know a bit more. I'm not 100% convinced by the CEO but the new CFO looks really focused on driving value and improving margins etc. Thoughts of others greatly appreciated!",

It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

From 2025 to 2026 there should be \u00a311m extra revenue and they have used a conservative 30% margin to generate \u00a33.3m on top of the \u00a31.7m EBITDA made in 2025. So there is the \u00a35m. He did say he's then taken 500k off to cover additional costs, but this seems to be a vague figure to keep  things conservative. So i interpret it as report \u00a34.5m but expect more. As they are not very good at hitting their own targets, quite a sensible approach. EAAS will eventually get things right, hopefully 2026 will be the year.",

Then barely 4 weeks later on 15/12 we get told that \u00a33 to \u00a34m of revenue would be pushed into 2026 due to delays in installation AND contract signings being delayed. So clearly the Nov RNS was misleading as not all the 2025 revenue had been formally contracted. Also the weather hadn't been that bad in Nov/Dec so the weather delays shouldn't have been an issue. Now \u00a34m has been pushed into 2026 but 2025 revenue has reduced by \u00a35m - the \u00a31m difference i referred to. This seems to have been missed by some including sharp eyed Tricky. So 2025 will be a YoY revenue reduction despite EAAS being in the middle of a growth sector and whilst an EBITDA increase is good, it will still result in a full year loss for the year, as clearly EBITDA is not profit. This follows big losses in 2023 and 2024. After the sell of EMD for \u00a325m in Jan 2024 we had \u00a317m in the bank after paying off \u00a38m debts. We now have c\u00a32m so that's a big reduction. Yes 2026 look a lot more promising for EAAS but they need to hit their own targets and be honest with RNSs.",

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

If the prediction for 2026 holds true this will fly in my view. Seemingly getting on top of costs given EBITA numbers.  These panel appointments take a long time to bed in - once you get a couple and they go well word spreads quickly.

I noticed on Wednesday that there were several 50k and 150k trades that seemed to be buys but LSE marked them as unknown (adding up to over \u00a330K).  I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .  The bid/offer spread has also been very tight over the last few days with the price difference between buys and sells being around 0.05p. This morning there were around \u00a320K of uncounted buys and a \u00a312.39k buy at 14:10, but the price still dropped! I finally bought into EAAS today at 4.5p as buys have exceeded sells for a few days straight and yet the price has fallen.  Maybe I've bought in too soon, but I'm hoping I've bought near the short-term bottom and EAAS is ready to bounce back next week.  This after hours trade also gives me hope that the price has finally bottomed. 28-Nov-25\t16:42:41\t4.55\t897,000\tBuy*\t4.40\t4.50\t40.81k\tO",

To start with 2025 YE numbers need to be hit, or be close to (\u00a328m rev and \u00a33m EBITDA i think). This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025).

The loan is a slight concern - high % and also mates rates warrants, however, as govt contracts the payment terms are longer than standard - so more money is paid upfront by EAAS and revenues take longer to arrive.

This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty.

It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

He did say he's then taken 500k off to cover additional costs, but this seems to be a vague figure to keep  things conservative. So i interpret it as report \u00a34.5m but expect more. As they are not very good at hitting their own targets, quite a sensible approach. EAAS will eventually get things right, hopefully 2026 will be the year.",

Then barely 4 weeks later on 15/12 we get told that \u00a33 to \u00a34m of revenue would be pushed into 2026 due to delays in installation AND contract signings being delayed. So clearly the Nov RNS was misleading as not all the 2025 revenue had been formally contracted. Also the weather hadn't been that bad in Nov/Dec so the weather delays shouldn't have been an issue. Now \u00a34m has been pushed into 2026 but 2025 revenue has reduced by \u00a35m - the \u00a31m difference i referred to. This seems to have been missed by some including sharp eyed Tricky. So 2025 will be a YoY revenue reduction despite EAAS being in the middle of a growth sector and whilst an EBITDA increase is good, it will still result in a full year loss for the year, as clearly EBITDA is not profit. This follows big losses in 2023 and 2024. After the sell of EMD for \u00a325m in Jan 2024 we had \u00a317m in the bank after paying off \u00a38m debts. We now have c\u00a32m so that's a big reduction. Yes 2026 look a lot more promising for EAAS but they need to hit their own targets and be honest with RNSs.",

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

I noticed on Wednesday that there were several 50k and 150k trades that seemed to be buys but LSE marked them as unknown (adding up to over \u00a330K).  I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .  The bid/offer spread has also been very tight over the last few days with the price difference between buys and sells being around 0.05p. This morning there were around \u00a320K of uncounted buys and a \u00a312.39k buy at 14:10, but the price still dropped! I finally bought into EAAS today at 4.5p as buys have exceeded sells for a few days straight and yet the price has fallen.  Maybe I've bought in too soon, but I'm hoping I've bought near the short-term bottom and EAAS is ready to bounce back next week.  This after hours trade also gives me hope that the price has finally bottomed. 28-Nov-25\t16:42:41\t4.55\t897,000\tBuy*\t4.40\t4.50\t40.81k\tO",

To start with 2025 YE numbers need to be hit, or be close to (\u00a328m rev and \u00a33m EBITDA i think). This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025). The 2026 comment is the cherry on the top of the cake. As mentioned, why do this after hours?  A 7am RNS would have surely been more appropriate and would have had a more positive SP impact.",

The loan is a slight concern - high % and also mates rates warrants, however, as govt contracts the payment terms are longer than standard - so more money is paid upfront by EAAS and revenues take longer to arrive. As original loan is only for 12 months EAAS must feel it is just a short term  solution to avoid a cashflow bottleneck.",

Also, whilst EAAS rarely do trading updates outside H1 and YE guidance things have been quiet since the H1 numbers were announced in late July. This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty. My rule of thumb over the last year or so, which has worked quite well,  has been to top up below 5p and make a quick (ish) 20% plus, however, i am not sure whether i want to put more into this until i know a bit more. I'm not 100% convinced by the CEO but the new CFO looks really focused on driving value and improving margins etc. Thoughts of others greatly appreciated!",

It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.  So this would equate to a valuation of c\u00a345m or 12p a share.",

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

From 2025 to 2026 there should be \u00a311m extra revenue and they have used a conservative 30% margin to generate \u00a33.3m on top of the \u00a31.7m EBITDA made in 2025. So there is the \u00a35m. He did say he's then taken 500k off to cover additional costs, but this seems to be a vague figure to keep  things conservative. So i interpret it as report \u00a34.5m but expect more. As they are not very good at hitting their own targets, quite a sensible approach. EAAS will eventually get things right, hopefully 2026 will be the year.",

Then barely 4 weeks later on 15/12 we get told that \u00a33 to \u00a34m of revenue would be pushed into 2026 due to delays in installation AND contract signings being delayed. So clearly the Nov RNS was misleading as not all the 2025 revenue had been formally contracted. Also the weather hadn't been that bad in Nov/Dec so the weather delays shouldn't have been an issue. Now \u00a34m has been pushed into 2026 but 2025 revenue has reduced by \u00a35m - the \u00a31m difference i referred to. This seems to have been missed by some including sharp eyed Tricky. So 2025 will be a YoY revenue reduction despite EAAS being in the middle of a growth sector and whilst an EBITDA increase is good, it will still result in a full year loss for the year, as clearly EBITDA is not profit. This follows big losses in 2023 and 2024. After the sell of EMD for \u00a325m in Jan 2024 we had \u00a317m in the bank after paying off \u00a38m debts. We now have c\u00a32m so that's a big reduction. Yes 2026 look a lot more promising for EAAS but they need to hit their own targets and be honest with RNSs.",

Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

          "content": "I found out about EAAS when LUCE sold their holding to Harwood in October.  I've been keeping an eye on EAAS since then as the share price continued to drift down.  I noticed on Wednesday that there were several 50k and 150k trades that seemed to be buys but LSE marked them as unknown (adding up to over \u00a330K).  I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .  The bid/offer spread has also been very tight over the last few days with the price difference between buys and sells being around 0.05p. This morning there were around \u00a320K of uncounted buys and a \u00a312.39k buy at 14:10, but the price still dropped! I finally bought into EAAS today at 4.5p as buys have exceeded sells for a few days straight and yet the price has fallen.  Maybe I've bought in too soon, but I'm hoping I've bought near the short-term bottom and EAAS is ready to bounce back next week.  This after hours trade also gives me hope that the price has finally bottomed. 28-Nov-25\t16:42:41\t4.55\t897,000\tBuy*\t4.40\t4.50\t40.81k\tO",

To start with 2025 YE numbers need to be hit, or be close to (\u00a328m rev and \u00a33m EBITDA i think). This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025).

The loan is a slight concern - high % and also mates rates warrants, however, as govt contracts the payment terms are longer than standard - so more money is paid upfront by EAAS and revenues take longer to arrive.

Also, whilst EAAS rarely do trading updates outside H1 and YE guidance things have been quiet since the H1 numbers were announced in late July. This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty. My rule of thumb over the last year or so, which has worked quite well,  has been to top up below 5p and make a quick (ish) 20% plus, however, i am not sure whether i want to put more into this until i know a bit more. I'm not 100% convinced by the CEO but the new CFO looks really focused on driving value and improving margins etc. Thoughts of others greatly appreciated!",

It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

From 2025 to 2026 there should be \u00a311m extra revenue and they have used a conservative 30% margin to generate \u00a33.3m on top of the \u00a31.7m EBITDA made in 2025. So there is the \u00a35m. He did say he's then taken 500k off to cover additional costs, but this seems to be a vague figure to keep  things conservative. So i interpret it as report \u00a34.5m but expect more. As they are not very good at hitting their own targets, quite a sensible approach. EAAS will eventually get things right, hopefully 2026 will be the year.",

Then barely 4 weeks later on 15/12 we get told that \u00a33 to \u00a34m of revenue would be pushed into 2026 due to delays in installation AND contract signings being delayed. So clearly the Nov RNS was misleading as not all the 2025 revenue had been formally contracted. Also the weather hadn't been that bad in Nov/Dec so the weather delays shouldn't have been an issue. Now \u00a34m has been pushed into 2026 but 2025 revenue has reduced by \u00a35m - the \u00a31m difference i referred to. This seems to have been missed by some including sharp eyed Tricky. So 2025 will be a YoY revenue reduction despite EAAS being in the middle of a growth sector and whilst an EBITDA increase is good, it will still result in a full year loss for the year, as clearly EBITDA is not profit. This follows big losses in 2023 and 2024. After the sell of EMD for \u00a325m in Jan 2024 we had \u00a317m in the bank after paying off \u00a38m debts. We now have c\u00a32m so that's a big reduction. Yes 2026 look a lot more promising for EAAS but they need to hit their own targets and be honest with RNSs.",

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

They have had accounting issues, no lump sum from sale and LUCE\u2019s decision to disinvest and again not delivered on numbers - so yes concerning It is a small company however and nothing ever goes as you expect - tiny market for a company with its fingers in so many pies.  If the prediction for 2026 holds true this will fly in my view. Seemingly getting on top of costs given EBITA numbers.  These panel appointments take a long time to bed in - once you get a couple and they go well word spreads quickly. They are in a fast growing and essential market and are incredibly active (check out their LinkedIn posts). Been burnt badly many times but in my view we are in for some fun years and in a critical sector for the environment",

To miss even that low guidance (and last year\u2019s revenue figure) is not good. Projections for next year sound good but this is the same company that has just failed to deliver on the projections they made and reiterated 6 months ago",

I noticed on Wednesday that there were several 50k and 150k trades that seemed to be buys but LSE marked them as unknown (adding up to over \u00a330K).  I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .  The bid/offer spread has also been very tight over the last few days with the price difference between buys and sells being around 0.05p. This morning there were around \u00a320K of uncounted buys and a \u00a312.39k buy at 14:10, but the price still dropped! I finally bought into EAAS today at 4.5p as buys have exceeded sells for a few days straight and yet the price has fallen.  Maybe I've bought in too soon, but I'm hoping I've bought near the short-term bottom and EAAS is ready to bounce back next week.  This after hours trade also gives me hope that the price has finally bottomed. 28-Nov-25\t16:42:41\t4.55\t897,000\tBuy*\t4.40\t4.50\t40.81k\tO",

To start with 2025 YE numbers need to be hit, or be close to (\u00a328m rev and \u00a33m EBITDA i think). This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025).

The loan is a slight concern - high % and also mates rates warrants, however, as govt contracts the payment terms are longer than standard - so more money is paid upfront by EAAS and revenues take longer to arrive.

This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty.

Doing some googling Inspired was sold in Aug 2025 for \u00a3183.6m. It's 2024 accounts had revenues of \u00a393m, EBITDA of \u00a323m and PBT of \u00a311.8m. It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.  So this would equate to a valuation of c\u00a345m or 12p a share.",

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",

From 2025 to 2026 there should be \u00a311m extra revenue and they have used a conservative 30% margin to generate \u00a33.3m on top of the \u00a31.7m EBITDA made in 2025. So there is the \u00a35m. He did say he's then taken 500k off to cover additional costs, but this seems to be a vague figure to keep  things conservative. So i interpret it as report \u00a34.5m but expect more. As they are not very good at hitting their own targets, quite a sensible approach. EAAS will eventually get things right, hopefully 2026 will be the year.",

          "content": "Not quite. 2025 revenues were forecast to be \u00a328m and only on 12/11 we were told this was on target with the caveat being adverse weather conditions could delay installations. Then barely 4 weeks later on 15/12 we get told that \u00a33 to \u00a34m of revenue would be pushed into 2026 due to delays in installation AND contract signings being delayed. So clearly the Nov RNS was misleading as not all the 2025 revenue had been formally contracted. Also the weather hadn't been that bad in Nov/Dec so the weather delays shouldn't have been an issue. Now \u00a34m has been pushed into 2026 but 2025 revenue has reduced by \u00a35m - the \u00a31m difference i referred to. This seems to have been missed by some including sharp eyed Tricky. So 2025 will be a YoY revenue reduction despite EAAS being in the middle of a growth sector and whilst an EBITDA increase is good, it will still result in a full year loss for the year, as clearly EBITDA is not profit. This follows big losses in 2023 and 2024. After the sell of EMD for \u00a325m in Jan 2024 we had \u00a317m in the bank after paying off \u00a38m debts. We now have c\u00a32m so that's a big reduction. Yes 2026 look a lot more promising for EAAS but they need to hit their own targets and be honest with RNSs.",

          "content": "Yesterday's RNS was disappointing IMHO, although not a disaster. Essentially some work and contracts anticipated to be completed/signed in late 2025 will now roll over into early 2026. However, only last month we were told take YE expectations would be met unless there was adverse weather now we are being told \"This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026\". So we were reliant on a few contracts being signed in 2025 and they have been slightly delayed. It is important we get clear and accurate RNSs and arguably the Nov one was not. The \u00a34m to \u00a35m miss is reasonably substantial and must have been a concern this time last month when the RNS was released. So YE 25 was meant to be \u00a328m rev and i think \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m EBITDA. YE 26 was i think \u00a330m and \u00a34m EBITDA. Now it is c\u00a324m and less than \u00a32m EBITDA and  the missed part is moved to YE26 numbers. I do think 2026 numbers were already reasonably conservative so i remain of this opinion. We also have the GB Energy contract in Q1 2026 which is a higher margin but longer payment terms  (hence the short term loan being arranged) which is no doubt why H1 2026 is estimated at \u00a320m revenue (100% more than H1 2025). So all in all we must accept that as a small company the odd contract delay can impact numbers (a 2025 to 2026 delay could essentially be 1 or 2 weeks) but the overall direction of travel must be positive and growing. I think undoubtedly EAAS is moving in the right direction.",

I noticed on Wednesday that there were several 50k and 150k trades that seemed to be buys but LSE marked them as unknown (adding up to over \u00a330K).  I observed the same thing on Thursday, with trades worth \u00a348K that seemed to be buys not being counted .  The bid/offer spread has also been very tight over the last few days with the price difference between buys and sells being around 0.05p. This morning there were around \u00a320K of uncounted buys and a \u00a312.39k buy at 14:10, but the price still dropped! I finally bought into EAAS today at 4.5p as buys have exceeded sells for a few days straight and yet the price has fallen.  Maybe I've bought in too soon, but I'm hoping I've bought near the short-term bottom and EAAS is ready to bounce back next week.  This after hours trade also gives me hope that the price has finally bottomed. 28-Nov-25\t16:42:41\t4.55\t897,000\tBuy*\t4.40\t4.50\t40.81k\tO",

To start with 2025 YE numbers need to be hit, or be close to (\u00a328m rev and \u00a33m EBITDA i think). This should produce a PBT of c \u00a3900k which is much need after 2 years of big losses following cashflow issues and then restructuring. Cash should also improve, as it did in H1. As we are less than 6 weeks away from YE i am reasonably confident of this., albeit aware of the weather warning that could push some solar installation into Q1 2026. H1 still had a couple of one off payments, and this needs to stop going forward as it is difficult to value and trust a company when so many one off events keep occurring. It does seem that the foundations have been reset now and 2026 onwards gives the company a more solid balance sheet to go after big and longer contracts. I would expect EBITDA and PBT to start rising quickly from here. Being a preferred supplier in GB Energy can only help IMHO",

          "content": "Newboy - very fair comments. My reading of this is that this is a unique contract that EAAS felt they couldn't say no to. It appears to be part of Great British Energy so the T&Cs are pretty much fixed by the govt and we either accept them or don't participate. My guess is that whilst the size of the contract and the profit margin are attractive the payment terms are less so. For example if EAAS needs to pay for say \u00a32m of solar panels upfront and staff and admin costs are similar they will expect to make say 25% or \u00a31m profit on this \u00a34m investment (which appears to run for a limited period - Nov 2025 to March 2026). However, payment terms will be restrictive e.g. no payment until work completed and then maybe 90 days payment terms . GB Energy will going forward have large contracts in exactly the space EAAS is in so we have to be a preferred supplier.  Hence the decision to take out the short term loan to ease the potential upfront cash constraints.   The FD/CFO has made it clear how focussed they are on cash and that they will only bid for a contract if the terms and attractive and any upfront outlay can be recouped in a short period. In the last online investor meeting he stated that every contract tender has to be approved by him before it is submitted.  I suspect an exception was made on the proviso that a short term loan could be agreed. As the RNS states \"Installations under the Programme are expected to commence in November 2025. As installations commence and scale, there will be an associated working capital demand on the Company's cash flow. The agreed customer payment terms for work conducted under the Programme are longer than the Company's usual payment term which increases the short-term working capital requirements for the Company.\" https://www.gov.uk/government/news/great-british-energy-to-extend-solar-scheme-to-military-sites",

They were clearly hoping to have some contract news to announce so they could add in a TU update to show that progress continues to be made (H2 rev is forecast to be \u00a318m after \u00a310m in H1, and i think this will result in c\u00a33m EBITDA for 2025). The 2026 comment is the cherry on the top of the cake. As mentioned, why do this after hours?  A 7am RNS would have surely been more appropriate and would have had a more positive SP impact.",

The loan is a slight concern - high % and also mates rates warrants, however, as govt contracts the payment terms are longer than standard - so more money is paid upfront by EAAS and revenues take longer to arrive.

This is not necessarily a negative - if YE numbers are on track there is nothing to say - however, it does create some uncertainty. My rule of thumb over the last year or so, which has worked quite well,  has been to top up below 5p and make a quick (ish) 20% plus, however, i am not sure whether i want to put more into this until i know a bit more. I'm not 100% convinced by the CEO but the new CFO looks really focused on driving value and improving margins etc. Thoughts of others greatly appreciated!",

Doing some googling Inspired was sold in Aug 2025 for \u00a3183.6m. It's 2024 accounts had revenues of \u00a393m, EBITDA of \u00a323m and PBT of \u00a311.8m. It did also have \u00a359m of debt too, and following EMDs sale EAAS is almost debt free. Based on PBT PE that's a 15 times multiple valuation. I think EAAS is aiming for c\u00a33m PBT in 2026.  So this would equate to a valuation of c\u00a345m or 12p a share.",

It designs and delivers LED lighting upgrades, on-site solar PV, and EV charging\u2014and crucially offers capital-free funding so customers can proceed with no upfront cost (energy-as-a-Service). This capital is NOT provided by e-Energy but by funding partners (Natwest & Redaptive who between them offer \u00a3150m of funding capacity for projects). Following strategic errors and contract delays, the business trades on 4.0x EV/EBITDA even though its 2026 forecast is for one of its largest profit figures ever of \u00a34.5m EBITDA. This offers value to Onward as investors in the context of its 14% margins and clear public sector tailwind for energy efficiency projects. e-Energy recently won its largest ever contract for the education sector. Indeed we believe the business has a covetable public sector market position and that this route to market currently trades at a material discount to recent transactions such as the takeout of inspired energy at around 10x EBITDA.",
