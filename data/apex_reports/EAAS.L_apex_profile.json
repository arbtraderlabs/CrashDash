We have an exceptional proposition, underpinned by a funding model which provides our customers with a truly off-balance sheet solution, which we believe is unique in the UK market.\n\"eEnergy is growing from strength to strength and is seeing increasing demand for its services. We recorded revenues of \u00a323.0m in FY25, and are pleased to report significant improvement in profitability, with Group Adjusted EBITDA* increasing 183% to \u00a31.7m (2024: \u00a30.6m). This reflects how we have now optimised our operating structure and cost base, improved our operating efficiencies, and succeeded in maintaining strong organic growth in our direct sales pipeline.\n\"We are pleased to have secured several major new contracts and awards in H2-25, namely Mace, LASER and the NHS NEEF portfolio. Despite the strong sales growth over FY25, evidenced by our record year-end contracted order book which is 100% higher from the position at the start of the FY25, a small number of large contracts were delayed which we expect to conclude in H1-26.\n\"Whilst this shift in anticipated revenues beyond the FY25 year-end was frustrating, the underlying contract economics and gross values are unchanged. This revenue is now expected in H1-26 which, alongside our strong pipeline, significantly increases the Board's confidence for the outlook in FY26.\n\"As we commence FY26, we do so with a record forward order book of \u00a314.0m, a 100% increase over the position at the start of the year\n(\u00a37.0m), a stable operating platform, a highly experienced operational management team and a streamlined cost structure. Our focus is now on securing and delivering larger scale projects, improving gross margin and cash generation and we expect to see record revenues in H1-26. The FY25 revenue shift into FY26 was timing-related only and consequently we have upgraded FY26 guidance for revenue by 13.3% from \u00a330.0m to \u00a334.0m, and Adjusted EBITDA by 12.5% from \u00a34.0m to \u00a34.5m.\n\"We have secured large scale government contracts which demonstrates the confidence in our execution and delivery model which is now poised for scale. These deals bring the benefit of assured scale and long-term value but, with that, comes the inevitability of more complex sign off procedures with multi-party procurement structures.\n\"Finally, the Board is pleased to welcome Nicholas Mills as a Non-Executive Director to the Company. Nicholas brings extensive experience, and the Board looks forward to drawing on his insight and expertise as we continue to deliver on our strategy. Nicholas's appointment, alongside Harwood's active, long-term value approach and its record of accomplishment and of working closely with smaller UK companies to unlock potential, provides the Board with additional support as we focus on accelerating performance and driving improved returns for all shareholders.\n\"I look forward to 2026 with continued confidence.\"\nInvestor presentation\nThere will be an online presentation, open to all existing and potential shareholders, via Investor Meet Company at 10.00.am on 26 January 2026.

The contract with Symphony Healthcare Services Limited (a subsidiary of Somerset NHS Foundation Trust) covers LED lighting upgrades across 18 GP surgeries, with a total contract value of c\u00a30.7 million, and will be delivered across Somerset (South West England).\nBacked by Redaptive, this new, unique, funding solution enables eEnergy to install the energy-savings systems at the customers sites, whilst the customer pays for the equipment from energy savings or total use rather than as an upfront payment. eEnergy retains operational responsibility for the installed equipment, supporting service-style treatment.\nThe EPC funding structure is a first of its kind in the UK, a much needed solution for the NHS that is expected to be transformational for NHS organisations. Developed in response to recent IFRS accounting rule changes, this solution has been specifically designed to help NHS bodies overcome IFRS 16 related on balance sheet considerations.\nThis EPC is available to all organisations and businesses and is specifically designed for the UK public sector. The solution has been specifically structured to address key barriers that can slow adoption of energy transition and on-site generation in the public sector.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, said:\n\"The challenge is unlocking fast delivery without consuming scarce capital or creating unwanted balance-sheet complexity. While Great British Energy is expected to support projects across the UK healthcare and education sectors, many NHS Trusts remain constrained in accessing at pace proven technologies such as LED lighting, Solar PV, and EV charging. Our EPC solution is designed to address this gap and remove barriers faced by NHS organisations.\n\"At eEnergy, we are constantly exploring new and innovative ways to help organisations accelerate their net zero journey. This new solution strengthens our ability to deliver energy-saving projects without incurring upfront cost, helping more clients reduce consumption, cut costs, and achieve their sustainability goals. Combined with the Group's multiple public sector framework awards, it positions eEnergy to help accelerate delivery of NHS decarbonisation programmes.\n\"Winning our first EPC-funded contract with Symphony Healthcare Services Limited is an important validation. It demonstrates clear appetite for an NHS-ready solution and provides a platform to scale LED programmes today while supporting a broader pathway to Solar PV and EV infrastructure.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris, David Asquith\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 20 7920 3150\nJos Simson, Nick Dibden, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nA\nbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is a UK-based Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) provider, funding and delivering energy-saving and energy-generating solutions across multi-site public sector and commercial portfolios-helping customers cut energy waste, reduce operating costs, and improve building resilience with zero upfront cost.\neEnergy delivers four core solutions:\n\u00b7\nReduce\n: LED lighting and controls\n\u00b7\nGenerate\n: Solar PV (rooftop, ground mount, and carport)\n\u00b7\nStore\n: Battery storage (store onsite generation and reduce peak-time import costs)\n\u00b7\nCharge\n: EV charging infrastructure and management\nProjects are funded through dedicated facilities, including up to \u00a3100m of project funding via eEnergy's partnership with Redaptive, and a \u00a340m NatWest facility supporting public sector deployments.\neEnergy's routes to market include direct sales, public sector frameworks, tenders, and strategic partnerships.

In addition, it provides an operational update on the rollout and mobilisation of its significant solar PV agreement announced on 1 September 2025.\nAs announced at the Half Year Results, the Company continues to see strong demand for its services and has developed an investment grade pipeline of c.\u00a3127m net revenue across 996 active projects created in FY2025. The Group was also pleased to announce several record new contracts in the Period, particularly for its Solar PV business. During the Period, the Group also began the installations as part of an enlarged program of work with Mace which now encompasses solar PV, LED, EV charging and battery installation across what is now circa 74 schools mainly in the Midlands and partly in the London area. This work is expected to be completed by end of Q12026.\nDuring the Period, the Group was awarded a \u00a31.5m solar PV installation contract by the bakery Brioche Pasquier, with the project now live. This carport project is one of the UK's largest carport systems, and positions eEnergy well to meet the strong growth in demand expected for car port solar PV products in 2026.\nThe Company is now appointed on five frameworks which are already yielding results with contracts being awarded, notably the \u00a30.5m contract with University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, won through the NHS Commercial Solutions framework. These frameworks broaden the Group's channels to market alongside its direct sales.\nSince entering the \u00a3100m funding partnership with Redaptive Inc in May 2025, eEnergy has drawn down USD$17.4m of the fund covering over 175 solar and LED projects across 179 locations and 51 customers.\nFY2025 and Outlook\nThe business is now benefiting from additional sector exposure, an expanded technology offering and a reduced reliance on direct sales with significant revenue derived from tenders. The Company has increased its participation in major frameworks and is seeing access to a growing number of larger contract opportunities, which is all consistent with the Group's strategy to pursue larger contract awards and diversifying.\nDespite significant progress made during the year, with substantial pipeline growth, the securing of several major contracts and gross margins continuing to show improvement year on year, the Group now expects approximately \u00a33m-\u00a34m of previously anticipated FY2025 revenue to be recognised in H12026. This is as a result of delays in the installation phases of existing signed contracts together with a number of anticipated significant investment grade contract signings being pushed in to early 2026, which will now result in the revenue not being recognised until FY2026. These revenues will now be incremental to FY26 and, alongside the currently secured record contracted FY26 order book of \u00a310.5m (January 2025: \u00a37.0m) and the Group's growing investment grade pipeline of opportunities created in FY2025, the Group expects a record FY2026 as outlined below.\nThe Company remains in final stage discussions with several NHS trusts awaiting decisions on NHS Energy Efficiency Fund (NEEF), which it expects decisions on by year end, with delivery on these contracts commencing in January 2026.\nAs a result of the factors outlined above, the Board now anticipates revenue for FY2025 will be between \u00a323m-\u00a324m (FY24: \u00a325.1m) depending on the value of contracts awarded and signed in the last two weeks of December this year. In addition, the Board now expects adjusted EBITDA to show material increase over the prior year (FY2024: \u00a30.6m) with a current range for FY2025 of between \u00a31.5m-\u00a31.9m, subject to the outcome of new sales awards in the remainder of the year.\nWith the expected increased run rate of new sales converting into revenue and the circa \u00a33m-4m of expected H22025 revenue now expected in H12026, the Board expects a corresponding uplift in revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA for FY2026. Given the significant quantum of contract revenues underpinning the improved FY2026 revenue and profit performance, the Board estimates H12026 revenue in the region of c.\u00a320m, double the previous year. The Board also revises guidance for FY2026 revenues and adjusted EBITDA, upgrading both by c.13% to \u00a334m and \u00a34.5m respectively.\nHarvey Sinclair, CEO of eEnergy, commented:\n\"eEnergy continues to see strong demand for its services and we are pleased to have secured several record contracts in H2 2025. Despite the continued growth in our new sales pipeline, contract signings have been delayed and we are now expecting the majority of the Mace installation and new sales awards to be recognised in H12026. Whilst this shift in revenues beyond the year end is frustrating, the underlying contract economics and gross value are unchanged. This portion of revenue is now concentrated into early FY2026 which, alongside our strong pipeline, significantly increases the Board's confidence in an improved financial outturn in FY2026. The slippage experienced was timing-related only, and consequently we have upgraded FY2026 guidance for revenue by c.13% from \u00a330m to \u00a334m, and adjusted EBITDA by c.12.5% from \u00a34m to \u00a34.5m.\n\"We remain focused on enabling organisations to achieve sustainable energy savings, protect themselves against future energy price volatility, and accelerate progress toward net zero. We have continued to deliver on our strategy, focusing on participating in more public sector framework deals. These bring the benefit of assured scale and long-term value but, as we have witnessed recently, it brings associated risk of unpredictability around formalisation and installation of the work due to the nature of multi-party procurement structures. Furthermore, we have rationalised our cost base, improved our operating efficiencies and maintain a strong pipeline and growth trajectory. I look forward to 2026 with continued confidence.\"\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.eenergy.com\nor contact:\neEnergy Group plc\nTel: +44 20 3813 1550\nHarvey Sinclair, Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Gahan, Chief Financial Officer\ninfo@eenergy.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 20 7409 3494\nRichard Johnson, James Harris\nCanaccord Genuity Limited\n(Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7523 8000\nMax Hartley, Harry Pardoe (Corporate Broking)\nTavistock\nTel: +44 20 7920 3150\nJos Simson, Nick Dibden, Katie Hopkins\neEnergy@tavistock.co.uk\nAbout eEnergy Group plc\neEnergy (AIM: EAAS) is a UK-based Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) provider, funding and delivering energy-saving and energy-generating solutions across multi-site public sector and commercial portfolios-helping customers cut energy waste, reduce operating costs, and improve building resilience with zero upfront cost.\neEnergy delivers four core solutions:\n\u00b7\nReduce\n: LED lighting and controls\n\u00b7\nGenerate\n: Solar PV (rooftop, ground mount, and carport)\n\u00b7\nStore:\nBattery storage (store onsite generation and reduce peak-time import costs)\n\u00b7\nCharge\n: EV charging infrastructure and management\nProjects are funded through dedicated facilities, including up to \u00a3100m of project funding via eEnergy's partnership with Redaptive, and a \u00a340m NatWest facility supporting public sector deployments.\neEnergy's routes to market include direct sales, public sector frameworks, tenders and strategic partnerships.
