FID on Sea Lion proves that projects in the Falklands are bankable and further enhances the value of our project.\nWe believe that FID on Sea Lion as well as the opening up of a new oil province will re-focus attention from both the oil industry and its investors on the area and Darwin. Our world class Darwin prospect has over 460 million barrels of recoverable liquids, a phased development plan, very quick payback and huge upside with 40 plus prospects that could yield over 9 billion barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 10Tcf of gas.

Darwin\u00a0continues\u00a0to elicit fresh and renewed interest from potential tier one industry partners and we are delighted with the progress that Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank we appointed to run the farm out process, is making.\nWe are not only blessed with licences of a quality, scale and optionality that attract\u00a0major oil companies,\u00a0but we are lucky enough to be operating\u00a0within a regime which offers highly competitive fiscal terms and a government executive that is seeking and looking to\u00a0open up\u00a0the Falkland Islands as a new hydrocarbon\u00a0producing basin. We enjoy a very healthy working relationship with the\u00a0Falkland\u00a0Islands'\u00a0Government and look forward to the next phase of that relationship and the development of the Darwin project.\nThe first half of 2025 saw us further strengthen our balance sheet. We raised \u00a32.2m (before costs)\u00a0from institutional and private investors and we are very grateful for their continuing support. The funds raised will be used to fund the Company's licence fees, the discovery area fees, technical and commercial studies and generaland administrative expenses. Following the fundraise the Company has sufficient funds to cover its expected overheads until the end of 2026, considerably strengthening the Company's position as we seek an appropriate\u00a0development partner\n.\nIt is worth noting that the 10p warrants which were issued as part of the transaction are already in the money and have started to be exercised.\nWe have noticed the continued positive statements from\u00a0Navitas\u00a0with regards to the Sea Lion development and recent fundraisings by both\u00a0Navitas\u00a0and Rockhopper. Final investment decision on Sea Lion is expected in Q4 of this year and this will undoubtedly be a major catalyst for the Falkland Islands basin and thus ourselves.\nAfter years of under investment in the sector, there have been many recent reports by oil and gas companies and large consulting firms\u00a0that capital investment is moving back into upstream development projects to support future earnings and growth. A recent report from the International Energy Agency has highlighted the historical under investment in new projects and an over reliance on shale oil and gas. The world's major oil fields are declining at a faster rate than previously thought.\u00a0New investment is needed to replace these declining fields.\nDarwin is a an exceptionally low risk project with compelling economics. We are confident we will complete the partner process in due course for the benefit of all stakeholders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all shareholders for their continued support and I very much look forward to the remainder of the year ahead and providing further updates on our progress.\nHarry Baker\nCEO\n23 September 2025\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.bordersandsouthern.com\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc\nTel: 020 7071 6984\nHarry Baker, CEO\nZeus (NOMAD and Joint Broker)\nTel: 0203 829 5000\nNick Searle\nSimon Johnson\nAntonio Bossi\nAndrew de Andrade\nHannam & Partners (Joint Broker)\nTel: 0207 907 8500\nNeil Passmore\nLeif Powis\nTavistock (Financial PR)\nTel: 020 7920 3150\nSimon Hudson\nNick Elwes\nNotes to Editors:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc (AIM: BOR) is an oil & gas exploration company listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.

The Group has not elected to comply with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" as permitted. The principal accounting policies used in preparing the interim financial statements are unchanged from those disclosed in the Group's Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2024 and are expected to be consistent with those policies that will be in effect at the year end.\nThe condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 are unreviewed and unaudited. The comparative financial information does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined by Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006\n.\nThe comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024 is not the company's full statutory accounts for that period. A copy of those statutory financial statements has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditors' report on those accounts was unqualified and did include references to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis relating to going concern without qualifying their report and did not contain a statement under section 498(2)-(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nFor the six-month reporting period up until 30 June 2025, Borders & Southern had a loss from operations of $441,000 (a loss for the same period in 2024 was $578,000). Administrative expenses were $608,000 (2024: $581,000). The cash balance at the 30 June 2025 was $3.2 million compared with a balance of $0.76 million at 30 June 2024.\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe Board continuously assesses and monitors the key risks of the business. The key risks that could affect the Company's medium term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the 2024 Annual Report, a copy of which is available on the Company's website: www.bordersandsouthern.com. The key financial risks are access to capital and market volatility risk.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThe preparation of condensed interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in Note 2 the 2024 Annual Report. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period.\n2.\nLoSS per share\nThe calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.\nDiluted loss per share is not stated as the result would be ant-dilutive given the loss in the period.\nLoss after tax for\nthe period\n$000\nWeighted average number of shares\nLoss\nper share\n(cents)\nBasic and diluted\nSix months ended 30 June 2025 (unaudited)\n(441)\n878,456,911\n(0.05)\nSix months ended 30 June 2024 (unaudited)\n(578)\n730,814,138\n(0.08)\nTwelve months ended 31 December 2024 (audited)\n(1,217)\n753,828,155\n(0.16)\n3.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe movement in capitalised exploration and evaluation costs during the period was as follows:\nExploration and evaluation costs\n$000\nCost\nAs at 1 January 2025\n294,269\nAdditions\n518\nAs at 30 June 2025\n294,787\nNet book value\nAs at 1 January 2025\n294,269\nAs at 30 June 2025\n294,787\n4.\nOTHER RECEIVABLES\n30 June 2025\n$000\n31 December 2024\n$000\nCurrent\nOther receivables\n81\n68\nPrepayments\n545\n1,022\nTotal\n626\n1,090\n5.\nTRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES\n30 June 2025\n$000\n31 December 2024\n$000\nTrade payables\n62\n1,036\nOther taxes and social security\n18\n17\nAccruals\n10\n128\nTotal\n90\n1,181\n6.\nPOST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\nThere have been no significant post balance sheet events.\n\u200b\n-ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
