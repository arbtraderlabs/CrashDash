FID on Sea Lion proves that projects in the Falklands are bankable and further enhances the value of our project.\nWe believe that FID on Sea Lion as well as the opening up of a new oil province will re-focus attention from both the oil industry and its investors on the area and Darwin. Our world class Darwin prospect has over 460 million barrels of recoverable liquids, a phased development plan, very quick payback and huge upside with 40 plus prospects that could yield over 9 billion barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 10Tcf of gas.

Darwin\u00a0continues\u00a0to elicit fresh and renewed interest from potential tier one industry partners and we are delighted with the progress that Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank we appointed to run the farm out process, is making.\nWe are not only blessed with licences of a quality, scale and optionality that attract\u00a0major oil companies,\u00a0but we are lucky enough to be operating\u00a0within a regime which offers highly competitive fiscal terms and a government executive that is seeking and looking to\u00a0open up\u00a0the Falkland Islands as a new hydrocarbon\u00a0producing basin. We enjoy a very healthy working relationship with the\u00a0Falkland\u00a0Islands'\u00a0Government and look forward to the next phase of that relationship and the development of the Darwin project.\nThe first half of 2025 saw us further strengthen our balance sheet. We raised \u00a32.2m (before costs)\u00a0from institutional and private investors and we are very grateful for their continuing support. The funds raised will be used to fund the Company's licence fees, the discovery area fees, technical and commercial studies and generaland administrative expenses. Following the fundraise the Company has sufficient funds to cover its expected overheads until the end of 2026, considerably strengthening the Company's position as we seek an appropriate\u00a0development partner\n.\nIt is worth noting that the 10p warrants which were issued as part of the transaction are already in the money and have started to be exercised.\nWe have noticed the continued positive statements from\u00a0Navitas\u00a0with regards to the Sea Lion development and recent fundraisings by both\u00a0Navitas\u00a0and Rockhopper. Final investment decision on Sea Lion is expected in Q4 of this year and this will undoubtedly be a major catalyst for the Falkland Islands basin and thus ourselves.\nAfter years of under investment in the sector, there have been many recent reports by oil and gas companies and large consulting firms\u00a0that capital investment is moving back into upstream development projects to support future earnings and growth. A recent report from the International Energy Agency has highlighted the historical under investment in new projects and an over reliance on shale oil and gas. The world's major oil fields are declining at a faster rate than previously thought.\u00a0New investment is needed to replace these declining fields.\nDarwin is a an exceptionally low risk project with compelling economics. We are confident we will complete the partner process in due course for the benefit of all stakeholders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all shareholders for their continued support and I very much look forward to the remainder of the year ahead and providing further updates on our progress.\nHarry Baker\nCEO\n23 September 2025\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.bordersandsouthern.com\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc\nTel: 020 7071 6984\nHarry Baker, CEO\nZeus (NOMAD and Joint Broker)\nTel: 0203 829 5000\nNick Searle\nSimon Johnson\nAntonio Bossi\nAndrew de Andrade\nHannam & Partners (Joint Broker)\nTel: 0207 907 8500\nNeil Passmore\nLeif Powis\nTavistock (Financial PR)\nTel: 020 7920 3150\nSimon Hudson\nNick Elwes\nNotes to Editors:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc (AIM: BOR) is an oil & gas exploration company listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.

The Group has not elected to comply with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" as permitted. The principal accounting policies used in preparing the interim financial statements are unchanged from those disclosed in the Group's Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2024 and are expected to be consistent with those policies that will be in effect at the year end.\nThe condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 are unreviewed and unaudited. The comparative financial information does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined by Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006\n.\nThe comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024 is not the company's full statutory accounts for that period. A copy of those statutory financial statements has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditors' report on those accounts was unqualified and did include references to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis relating to going concern without qualifying their report and did not contain a statement under section 498(2)-(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nFor the six-month reporting period up until 30 June 2025, Borders & Southern had a loss from operations of $441,000 (a loss for the same period in 2024 was $578,000). Administrative expenses were $608,000 (2024: $581,000). The cash balance at the 30 June 2025 was $3.2 million compared with a balance of $0.76 million at 30 June 2024.\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe Board continuously assesses and monitors the key risks of the business. The key risks that could affect the Company's medium term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the 2024 Annual Report, a copy of which is available on the Company's website: www.bordersandsouthern.com. The key financial risks are access to capital and market volatility risk.\nCritical accounting estimates\nThe preparation of condensed interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in Note 2 the 2024 Annual Report. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period.\n2.\nLoSS per share\nThe calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.\nDiluted loss per share is not stated as the result would be ant-dilutive given the loss in the period.\nLoss after tax for\nthe period\n$000\nWeighted average number of shares\nLoss\nper share\n(cents)\nBasic and diluted\nSix months ended 30 June 2025 (unaudited)\n(441)\n878,456,911\n(0.05)\nSix months ended 30 June 2024 (unaudited)\n(578)\n730,814,138\n(0.08)\nTwelve months ended 31 December 2024 (audited)\n(1,217)\n753,828,155\n(0.16)\n3.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe movement in capitalised exploration and evaluation costs during the period was as follows:\nExploration and evaluation costs\n$000\nCost\nAs at 1 January 2025\n294,269\nAdditions\n518\nAs at 30 June 2025\n294,787\nNet book value\nAs at 1 January 2025\n294,269\nAs at 30 June 2025\n294,787\n4.\nOTHER RECEIVABLES\n30 June 2025\n$000\n31 December 2024\n$000\nCurrent\nOther receivables\n81\n68\nPrepayments\n545\n1,022\nTotal\n626\n1,090\n5.\nTRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES\n30 June 2025\n$000\n31 December 2024\n$000\nTrade payables\n62\n1,036\nOther taxes and social security\n18\n17\nAccruals\n10\n128\nTotal\n90\n1,181\n6.\nPOST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\nThere have been no significant post balance sheet events.\n\u200b\n-ends-\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

FID on Sea Lion proves that projects in the Falklands are bankable and further enhances the value of our project.\nWe believe that FID on Sea Lion as well as the opening up of a new oil province will re-focus attention from both the oil industry and its investors on the area and Darwin. Our world class Darwin prospect has over 460 million barrels of recoverable liquids, a phased development plan, very quick payback and huge upside with 40 plus prospects that could yield over 9 billion barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 10Tcf of gas. We hold 100% of all our licenses. Borders & Southern look forward to updating the market as we continue to progress our Darwin development.\nBorders & Southern are delighted for Sam Moody and his team at Rockhopper in bringing the Sea Lion project on this journey from concept to development.\"\nFor further information please visit\nwww.bordersandsouthern.com\nor contact:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc\nvia Tavistock\nHarry Baker, CEO\nZeus (NOMAD and Joint Broker)\nTel: 0203 829 5000\nNick Searle\nSimon Johnson\nAntonio Bossi\nAndrew de Andrade\nHannam & Partners (Joint Broker)\nTel: 0207 907 8500\nNeil Passmore\nLeif Powis\nTavistock (Financial PR)\nTel: 020 7920 3150\nSimon Hudson\nNick Elwes\nNotes to Editors:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc is an oil & gas exploration company listed on the London Stock Exchange AIM (BOR).

The accounts contained within this report represent the consolidation of Borders & Southern Petroleum plc and its subsidiary Borders & Southern Falkland Islands Limited.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nOperating loss for the period was $441,000 (2024: $578,000)\n\u00b7\nCash balance on 30 June 2025 was $3.2 million (31 December 2024: $2.09 million)\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully raised \u00a32.2 million to continue to advance the Darwin discovery towards appraisal\n\u00b7\nDarwin farm out progressing, aided by improved industry sentiment towards upstream assets and the progress of the Sea Lion field in the North Falklands\nChief Executive's Statement\nIt's been four months since my last\u00a0Chairman and\u00a0CEO\u00a0review\u00a0and I'm very pleased to report that everything is progressing as planned.\nDuring the first half of 2025 we have continued to move our farm out discussions forward. Darwin\u00a0continues\u00a0to elicit fresh and renewed interest from potential tier one industry partners and we are delighted with the progress that Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank we appointed to run the farm out process, is making.\nWe are not only blessed with licences of a quality, scale and optionality that attract\u00a0major oil companies,\u00a0but we are lucky enough to be operating\u00a0within a regime which offers highly competitive fiscal terms and a government executive that is seeking and looking to\u00a0open up\u00a0the Falkland Islands as a new hydrocarbon\u00a0producing basin. We enjoy a very healthy working relationship with the\u00a0Falkland\u00a0Islands'\u00a0Government and look forward to the next phase of that relationship and the development of the Darwin project.\nThe first half of 2025 saw us further strengthen our balance sheet. We raised \u00a32.2m (before costs)\u00a0from institutional and private investors and we are very grateful for their continuing support. The funds raised will be used to fund the Company's licence fees, the discovery area fees, technical and commercial studies and generaland administrative expenses. Following the fundraise the Company has sufficient funds to cover its expected overheads until the end of 2026, considerably strengthening the Company's position as we seek an appropriate\u00a0development partner\n.\nIt is worth noting that the 10p warrants which were issued as part of the transaction are already in the money and have started to be exercised.\nWe have noticed the continued positive statements from\u00a0Navitas\u00a0with regards to the Sea Lion development and recent fundraisings by both\u00a0Navitas\u00a0and Rockhopper. Final investment decision on Sea Lion is expected in Q4 of this year and this will undoubtedly be a major catalyst for the Falkland Islands basin and thus ourselves.\nAfter years of under investment in the sector, there have been many recent reports by oil and gas companies and large consulting firms\u00a0that capital investment is moving back into upstream development projects to support future earnings and growth. A recent report from the International Energy Agency has highlighted the historical under investment in new projects and an over reliance on shale oil and gas. The world's major oil fields are declining at a faster rate than previously thought.\u00a0New investment is needed to replace these declining fields.\nDarwin is a an exceptionally low risk project with compelling economics. We are confident we will complete the partner process in due course for the benefit of all stakeholders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all shareholders for their continued support and I very much look forward to the remainder of the year ahead and providing further updates on our progress.\nHarry Baker\nCEO\n23 September 2025\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.bordersandsouthern.com\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc\nTel: 020 7071 6984\nHarry Baker, CEO\nZeus (NOMAD and Joint Broker)\nTel: 0203 829 5000\nNick Searle\nSimon Johnson\nAntonio Bossi\nAndrew de Andrade\nHannam & Partners (Joint Broker)\nTel: 0207 907 8500\nNeil Passmore\nLeif Powis\nTavistock (Financial PR)\nTel: 020 7920 3150\nSimon Hudson\nNick Elwes\nNotes to Editors:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc (AIM: BOR) is an oil & gas exploration company listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company operates and has a 100% interest in three Production Licences in the South Falkland Basin covering an area of nearly 10,000 square kilometres. The Company has acquired 2,517 square kilometres of 3D seismic and drilled two exploration wells, making a significant gas condensate discovery with its first well.\nChairman's and CEO's review\nAfter my first full year as Borders and Southern CEO, it is my pleasure to address shareholders and bring everyone up to date with what has happened in the past twelve months and what we hope to achieve in the months and years to come.\nI was lucky enough to inherit a very robust project with highly commercial economics, a great board and a top technical team. Together we have\u00a0executed three strategic moves that leave us in what we believe is a much stronger position going forward.\nFirstly, we have f\nurther refined our phased early production offering which we believe will better appeal to potential international partners as it requires relatively low capex and offers accelerated payback.\nSecondly, we took the key step\nto appoint an International Investment Bank with worldwide networks\nto assist the Company in a farm-out to finance the next phase of the development of the Darwin discovery. We believe that this appointment, together with significant changes in industry appetite for projects, will greatly assist us in achieving our goal of bringing in a partner (or partners) on favourable terms.\u00a0It is worth noting that the new advisor has sufficient confidence in the strength of the investment case that they have agreed to work on a success case basis as opposed to the more usual retainer fees.\nAnd thirdly, we have made the vital move to put the Company onto a firmer financial footing.\nDuring 2024 the company also took several steps to further reduce overhead costs, which included moving offices. The Company has always benchmarked its overhead costs against its peers we remain in the lowest cost quartile. These reductions further reinforce this\n. We also completed two capital raises to strengthen the balance sheet (one post year end) and concomitantly, our negotiating position for the farm-out. In total we have raised about \u00a33.7m (pre costs) which, together with our existing resources, gives us well over two years runway.\u00a0Cash in the bank gives us the time and firepower to make the right deal or deals for shareholders, rather than be forced to accept the first one.\nThese three\u00a0initiatives have\u00a0put us in a\u00a0much stronger position. We are already seeing the benefits with renewed interest from\u00a0multiple parties in the data room.\u00a0It is worth\u00a0pointing out that Darwin is an appraisal project. Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent in the high risk exploration phase. Whilst the appraisal and development phases require significant capital, the exploration risk has been much reduced and will be eliminated once we have tested a well as part of the appraisal program. We know we have a world class project which is attracting interest from tier one industry potential partners.\nWe are really excited by Darwin and the prospects nearby as well as the size and scale of the remainder of the portfolio which can be seen in detail in our latest presentation on the website.\nWe look forward to reporting progress to\u00a0the market in due course.\nIn June 2024 we welcomed Dr. Sean Gu",

It received strong support from existing shareholders and was almost 3 times oversubscribed. The Retail Offer raised in aggregate \u00a30.2 million through the issuance of 4,210,526 Retail Offer Shares at a price of 4.75 pence each.\nAllocations were made to existing Shareholders, applying the principles of soft pre-emption. Existing Shareholders received 100 per cent. of their soft pre-emptive allowance, when their order matched or exceeded their soft pre-emptive allowance. Given the level of demand, where the order was greater than the soft pre-emptive allowance shareholders received approximately 23.37 per cent. of their additional demand1.\n1\nSoft Pre-emptive allowance Calculation: Existing shares X 5.5571% (Dilution from total new shares being issued) = Soft Pre-emptive allowance shares. Soft Pre-emptive allowance shares X 100% = Soft Pre-emptive allowance allocated shares. Additional demand allocation share calculation: (Total order shares - Soft pre-emptive allowance allocation shares) X approximately 23.37%.\nAccordingly, conditional on the passing of the Resolutions at the General Meeting and admission of the Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and Retail Offer Shares the Company has conditionally raised total gross proceeds of approximately \u00a32.2 million in aggregate by way of the Fundraising.\nHarry Baker, Chief Executive Officer of Borders & Southern, commented:\n\"I would like to thank all investors for their support at this pivotal time for the Company. We are hoping that increased engagement with potential partners will result in the right deal or deals being announced in due course. These funds give us the time and firepower to complete the right transaction for shareholders.\"\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Retail Offer Shares, a total of 4,210,526 new Ordinary Shares, to trading on AIM. It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings in the Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and Retail Offer Shares will commence on AIM at 8.00 a.m. on or around 20 March 2025 (or such later date as may be agreed between the Company and the Joint Bookrunners, but no later than 31 March 2025) (\"\nAdmission\n\").\nThe Placing Shares, Subscription Shares and Retail Offer Shares will be issued fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company in issue will be 877,630,245 with voting rights.

In our conversations with potential partners, it is clear to us that strengthening the balance sheet and providing working capital until the end of 2026 is the right thing to do. We remain encouraged by the industry interest in our relaunched Farm Out process and this strengthening of our balance sheet allows us to do the right deal and not just the first deal. We look forward to providing further updates on our industry negotiations in coming months.\n\"We would like to thank existing shareholders for their continued support and are pleased to welcome new investors. In my view, the industry trend of barrel hunting along the transform margin (seen in South Africa, Namibia, Guyana and Uruguay) is increasing focus on projects such as ours. We are really excited by Darwin & the prospects immediately adjacent to and underneath as well as the size and scale of the remainder of the portfolio which we have shared in our latest presentation. Current re-structuring of industry portfolios and a growing realisation that large companies are looking for projects needed to fulfil growth targets chimes with our world class projects and we are excited by the road ahead.\"\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares, a total of 42,105,263 new Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM.

The Issue Price is an approximate 16.67 per cent. discount to the Company's closing mid price of 1.8 pence on 1 October 2024.\nHighlights of the Fundraising:\n\u00b7\n\u00a31.5 million raised through the placing of 69,666,666 ordinary shares (the \"Placing Shares\") at the Issue Price (the \"Placing\") and subscription of 30,333,334 ordinary shares (the \"Subscription Shares\" and together with the Placing Shares, the \"Fundraise Shares\") at the Issue Price (the \"Subscription\")\n\u00b7\nThe Fundraising received significant board support from a majority of the board with Harry Dobson (Chairman), Harry Baker (CEO), and non-executive directors Sean Guest and Will Hodson all participating and subscribing for a total of \u00a3505,000, demonstrating continued alignment with shareholders and commitment to, and belief in, the future success of the business\n\u00b7\nThe Company has engaged a new international advisor to assist in moving the Darwin project forward towards appraisal of the Darwin discovery and is encouraged thus far by progress on the recently relaunched farm-out process\nUse of Proceeds\nThe proceeds of the Fundraising will be used to fund the Company's Licence fees, Discovery Area fees, technical and commercial studies, general & administrative expenses and, more generally, to advance the Company's Darwin project towards appraisal of the Darwin discovery.\nHarry Baker, Chief Executive Officer of Borders & Southern, commented:\n\"We are seeking to bring in a partner to move Darwin forward by either testing Darwin East or drilling another target and, as previously stated, have engaged a new International advisor to assist in this process. The funds raised will assist the Company in progressing this. We are encouraged by progress on the recently relaunched farm-out process thus far and look forward to providing further updates in the coming months.\n\"We only raised one year's overheads as we believe that the Company can make progress on the farm-out which would place it in a much stronger position in the future.\n\"We would also like to thank existing shareholders and new investors for their support in the Fundraising.\"\nDirector Participation and Related Party Transaction\nCertain directors of the Company participated in the Fundraise, details of which are outlined below:\nName\nPosition\nNumber of Fundraise Shares subscribed for\nShareholding following Admission\nPercentage of enlarged share capital\nHarry Dobson\nNon-Executive Chairman\n28,000,000\n109,372,000\n13.2%\nHarry Baker\nChief Executive Officer\n3,333,333\n3,333,333\n0.4%\nSean Guest\nNon-Executive Director\n1,666,667\n1,666,667\n0.2%\nWill Hodson\nNon-Executive Director\n666,667\n666,667\n0.08%\nThe participation of Harry Dobson, Harry Baker, Will Hodson and Sean Guest in the Fundraise are related party transactions for the purposes of AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies due to them being directors of the Company, and in the case of Harry Dobson, also a substantial shareholder.

The Company operates and has a 100% interest in three Production Licences in the South Falkland Basin covering an area of nearly 10,000 square kilometres. The Company has acquired 2,517 square kilometres of 3D seismic and drilled two exploration wells, making a significant gas condensate discovery with its first well.\nChief Executive's Statement\nBorders & Southern has a world-class undeveloped gas transition asset, and the main focus of the Company is to progress the Darwin project by bringing in a partner to finance the appraisal of the Darwin East discovery or to drill other exploration wells with the view to bringing Darwin into production.\nSince I joined the Company in March 2024, we have taken a number of important commercial decisions and made a number of key changes to move the business forward with the prime focus being to monetise rapidly the significant potential value of the Darwin gas condensate discovery. In pursuit of that, we have:\n\u00b7\nFurther refined our phased early production offering to appeal to potential international partners that requires relatively low capex and offers accelerated payback.\n\u00b7\nChanged our energy financial advisor to a much larger company with international relationships that has relaunched the search process to identify a suitable partner and will provide updates on this process as events allow.\n\u00b7\nBeen more active in updating and keeping all stakeholders informed, both with one-on-one investor meetings and with regularly updated investor presentations on the Company's redesigned website.\n\u00b7\nContinued to focus on lowering our cost base and have moved offices for a material reduction in overheads.\nWe have noticed that the energy industry is rebalancing in light of the longer transition timeframes to deliver renewable energies than previously envisaged with oil companies refocusing their investment activities back into upstream exploration and production. This has led to much more interest in material projects like Darwin that can be brought into production much faster than the lead time and costs involved in new exploration in frontier locations. The Company, therefore, remains confident that because of greater renewed upstream industry investment and exploration activity, Darwin will be a beneficiary of this trend. Darwin is a world-class asset awaiting appraisal and we now expect to be able to move forward to the next phase of its development.\nThe Company has made an application to The Falkland Islands Government to extend the Company's three Production Licenses with effect from the calendar year end of 2024, as has been done a number of times in previous years, and those discussions are at an advanced stage. Once finalised, an update will be provided.\nFinally, as previously announced, Sean Guest was appointed a Non-Executive Director earlier this year. Sean is an internationally experienced upstream executive who brings extensive industry knowledge, technical skills and contacts to the board.\nHarry Baker\nCEO\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2024\n6 months ended\n30 June 2024\n(unaudited)\n6 months ended\n30 June 2023\n(unaudited)\n12 months ended\n31 Dec 2023\n(audited)\nN\notes\n$000\n$000\n$000\nAdministrative expenses\n(581)\n(603)\n(1,141)\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n(581)\n(603)\n(1,141)\nFinance income\n3\n6\n45\n81\nFinance costs\n3\n(3)\n-\n-\nLOSS BEFORE TAX\n(578)\n(558)\n(1,060)\nTax expense\n-\n-\n-\nLOSS FOR THE PERIOD AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR THE PERIOD ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY OWNERS OF THE PARENT\n(578)\n(558)\n(1,060)\nLoss per share - basic and diluted\n2\n(0.08)\ncents\n(0.08) cents\n(0.14) cents\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAt 30 June 2024\nAt\n30 June 2024\n(unaudite",

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nNotes to Editors:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc is an oil & gas exploration company listed on the London Stock Exchange AIM (BOR). The Company operates and has a 100% interest in three Production Licences in the South Falkland Basin covering an area of nearly 10,000 square kilometres. The Company has acquired 2,517 square kilometres of 3D seismic and drilled two exploration wells, making a significant gas condensate discovery with its first well.\nChairman's and CEO's review\nDuring the reporting period, the Company successfully completed the 2022 capital raise which was approved by shareholders at a General Meeting in January 2023. The total number of Ordinary shares now in issue is now 730,814,456.\nThe Company finished the year with a cash balance of $1.9 million (31 December 2022: $2.7 million) and continues to be debt-free. The Company reports an operating loss for 2023 of $1.0 million (2022: $1.35 million). Administrative expense for the year was $1.1 million (2022: $1.1 million). The company continues to have a low cost base and notwithstanding wider inflationary pressures has managed to keep these costs at similar level to previous years.\nThe company continues to focus on moving the Darwin discovery forward. Independent engineering studies have confirmed the financial robustness of our project and as we have all heard and read about, there is a growing realization that industrial change cannot keep pace with social change and as a result the world will be reliant on hydrocarbons for longer than previously thought. As a consequence, the global oil and gas industry is evolving with many companies rebalancing their capital expenditures towards increased upstream as they believe that demand for oil and gas will be higher over the next two decades than previously envisaged. As a result, in order to replace production, capital expenditures will need to increase across the industry. Darwin is an attractive investment as it could be brought into production relatively quickly and the condensate is very marketable globally, selling at or close to Brent. Few upstream oil and gas projects are like Darwin and have a 1-2 year payback at current oil prices.\nIn addition to a conventional farm-out the Company is looking at alternative ways to finance the appraisal program and in the event these progress we will update investors.\nOnce Darwin is in production, there are many options for the cashflow including returning it to shareholders, reinvesting in building production or a combination of both. In addition to increasing Darwin's production by drilling further wells, there are multiple prospects to grow production in the licence areas around Darwin.\nAs we have previously reported, Howard Obee announced in early 2024 his intention to step down as CEO and board member at the end of February. We were very pleased to have appointed Harry Baker as CEO and board member effective 1 March 2024. Harry brings significant capital markets experience and industry connections to the Company which will be invaluable in the foreseeable future.\nWe would like",

The Company operates and has a 100% interest in three Production Licences in the South Falkland Basin covering an area of nearly 10,000 square kilometres. The Company has acquired 2,517 square kilometres of 3D seismic and drilled two exploration wells, making a significant gas condensate discovery with its first well.\nChief Executive's Statement\nThe Company incurred a loss from operations for the six-month period up to 30 June 2023 of $0.55 million (30 June 2022: $0.857 million). The Company's cash balance as of 30 June 2023 was $2.4 million (30 June 2022: $1.2 million). The cash balance reflects the funds raised through a conditional Placing and Subscription Agreement, initiated in the last quarter of 2022, and approved by shareholders at a General Meeting in January 2023. Most of these funds are held in a sterling treasury account. The Company continues to be debt-free.\nGlobal oil and gas prices have remained resilient throughout the year. Brent crude has been trading within the range $70-$90, and there are no obvious signs that it will weaken in the immediate future.\nAs reported earlier in the year, the Company has been sharing details of its technical and commercial work with potential industry collaborators. This work highlights that, following successful appraisal test results, a phased development of the Darwin gas condensate discovery in the South Falkland Basin would be economically attractive. This activity continues.\nThe Company's current project work is focused on technical and commercial sensitivities associated with its initial three well, phased development scheme for Darwin. This includes assessing variations in production volumes that could allow us to take advantage of FPSO vessels that are available for redeployment. All our efforts continue to be focused on reducing project risks, shortening cycle time, and advancing Darwin's monetisation.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2023\n6 months ended\n30 June 2023\n(unaudited)\n6 months ended\n30 June 2022\n(unaudited)\n12 months ended\n31 Dec 2022\n(audited)\nN\notes\n$000\n$000\n$000\nAdministrative expenses\n(603)\n(747)\n(1,229)\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n(603)\n(747)\n(1,229)\nFinance income\n3\n45\n-\n(172)\nFinance costs\n3\n-\n(110)\n42\nLOSS BEFORE TAX\n(558)\n(857)\n(1,359)\nTax expense\n-\n-\n-\nLOSS FOR THE PERIOD AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR THE PERIOD ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY OWNERS OF THE PARENT\n(558)\n(857)\n(1,359)\nLoss per share - basic and diluted\n2\n(0.08)\ncents\n(0.15) cents\n(0.26) cents\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAt 30 June 2023\nAt\n30 June 2023\n(unaudited)\n$000\nAt\n30 June 2022\n(unaudited)\n$000\nAt\n31 December 2022\n(audited)\n$000\nASSETS\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment\n7\n9\n-\nIntangible assets\n293,378\n293,064\n293,244\nTotal non-current assets\n293,385\n293,073\n293,244\nCURRENT ASSETS\nOther receivables\n494\n383\n576\nCash and cash equivalents\n2,410\n1,207\n2,707\nTOTAL CURRENT ASSETS\n2,904\n1,590\n3,283\nTOTAL ASSETS\n296,289\n294,663\n296,527\nLIABILITIES\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nTrade and other payables\n(105)\n(287)\n(565)\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n(105)\n(287)\n(565)\nTOTAL NET ASSETS\n296,184\n294,376\n295,962\nEQUITY\nShare capital\n11,160\n9,833\n10,718\nShare premium\nOther reserve\n310,527\n1,788\n308,993\n1,778\n310,195\n1,778\nRetained deficit\n(27,271)\n(26,212)\n(26,713)\nForeign currency reserve\n(20)\n(16)\n(16)\nTOTAL EQUITY\n296,184\n294,376\n295,962\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2023\nShare capital\n$000\nShare premium\n$000\nOther reserve\n$000\nRetained\nDeficit\n$000\nForeign\ncurrency\nreserve\n$000\nTotal\n$000\nUnaudited\nBalance at 1 January 2023\n10,718\n310,195\n1,778\n(26,713)\n(16)\n295,962\nTotal comp",

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nNotes to Editors:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc is an oil & gas exploration company listed on the London Stock Exchange AIM (BOR). The Company operates and has a 100% interest in three Production Licences in the South Falkland Basin covering an area of nearly 10,000 square kilometres. The Company has acquired 2,517 square kilometres of 3D seismic and drilled two exploration wells, making a significant gas condensate discovery with its first well.\nCompetent Person Disclosure:\nThe technical aspects of this announcement have been reviewed, verified and approved by Dr Howard Obee in accordance with the Guidance Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies, issued by the London Stock Exchange in respect of AIM companies. Dr Obee is a petroleum geologist with more than 30 year's relevant experience. He is a Fellow of the Geological Society and member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain.\nChairman's and CEO's review\nDuring the reporting period, the Company successfully completed two fund raisings, renewed its Production Licences and Discovery Area in the Falkland Islands, and commissioned an independent engineering study which validated a phased development concept for the Group's Darwin gas condensate discovery.\nAt the end of the first quarter 2022 the Company raised $600,000 through a Subscription Agreement and a further $1,200,000 through an oversubscribed Open Offer. The latter was approved by shareholders at a General Meeting in April. A total of 103,858,914 new Ordinary shares were issued. In the last quarter of 2022, the Company raised \u00a32,500,000 through a firm and conditional Placing and Subscription Agreement, issuing 142,857,138 new Ordinary shares. The conditional placing and subscription agreement was approved by shareholders at a General Meeting in January 2023. These funds will meet the Company's overheads until end 2024. The total number of Ordinary shares now in issue is 730,814,456.\nAs a result of the successful fund raisings, the Company finished the year with a cash balance of $2.7 million (31 December 2021: $0.714 million) and continues to be debt-free. The Company reports an operating loss for 2022 of $1.35 million (2021: $1.0 million). Administrative expense for the year was $1.2 million (2021: $1.1 million). There were no major capital expenditures during the year. We continue to keep a strong control on costs but anticipate a small increase in expenditure during 2023 due to wider inflationary pressures. Significant salary reductions were implemented in 2019 and have been kept at the same level ever since.\nIn January 2022, the Company applied for, and was awarded, an extension to its Falkland Islands Production Licences a",

The objectives were threefold: to generate a production profile that would require relatively low initial capital expenditure; to deliver accelerated payback; and to allow expansion of the production profile from free cash flow. We believe this has been achieved, and in this regard, an updated investor presentation will be uploaded to the Company's website giving further details of this development concept. The material points are highlighted below.\nThe preliminary development would focus on Darwin East. Assuming appraisal well flow rates meet reservoir modelling expectations, then initial production of 26,000 bpd could be achieved from two production wells and one gas injector well. The recently commissioned independent facilities engineering report validated the development concept, confirming that a conventional FPSO development concept could be utilised, typical of global deep water petroleum field developments. The proposed subsea components and topsides processing technologies would all be standard industry technology. The report also provided up to date cost estimates, per the below.\nAssuming the FPSO is leased, the capital requirement, excluding contingency, for the drilling, subsea, and project costs is estimated to be approximately $640 million. Based on Management's scoping study economic modelling, payback could be achieved within two years of first production (assuming $60/bbl oil price). This changes to one year with a $90/bbl oil price. The project economics are positively impacted by the high-quality reservoir with favourable fluid properties that does not require a large number of development wells, the application of a conventional FPSO development and the attractive fiscal terms set by the Falkland Islands Government.\nFollowing the initial exploitation phase, project expansion could occur from free cash flow by drilling further production wells on Darwin East and the full development of Darwin West. Several options have been identified that could, subject to certain assumptions, elevate production towards 70,000 bpd.\nThe Company believes that this new phased development concept with accelerated payback, presents an attractive opportunity for industry collaborators and will help attract the necessary funding to advance this exciting project.\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.bordersandsouthern.com\nor contact:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc\nHoward Obee, Chief Executive\nTel: 020 7661 9348\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / James Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Broker)\nRichard Hail / Adam Cowl\nTel: 020 3470 0470\nTavistock (Financial PR)\nSimon Hudson / Nick Elwes\nTel: 020 7920 3150\nNotes to Editors:\nBorders & Southern Petroleum plc is an oil & gas exploration company listed on the London Stock Exchange AIM (BOR).

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it. Still, I have my fingers crossed hoping for the best, but planning for something else. Good luck to us all, it would be about time. LTT",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

Neither Navitas or RKH would pay to upgrade it on BOR\u2019s behalf. Navitas would need to raise more funds to finance any drilling in the SFB and is it worth spending all the money to upgrade the rig too just for a well or two when it\u2019s not required for their development project in the NFB?  Highly unlikely in my opinion.  Well planning also takes months if not years - if Navitas were going to drill Darwin in advance of Sea Lion then a deal would have been done by now. The brutal reality, and I know you don\u2019t want to hear it, is that Harry has treated you like an obedient little lapdog who laps up everything he says and repeats it as gospel on here.

I have long held a substantial position in Borders because I believed firmly that the remoteness of the Falklands would quite naturally cause the entire province to come under a single management or joint venture.  In this respect I was completely wrong - while the prospect of Sea Lion FID ran up Borders' share price during the past 12 months, FID itself proved Borders to be uninvolved in the overall project to date,  and that Darwin thus remains a stranded asset.  Comments from HB and the company have done little to quell this conclusion - much innuendo about 'best offers', but none at all on the table.  It is now my revised view, like yours, that the next six months are critical.  Should no truly noteworthy developments be fortcoming during that period, Borders seems likely to miss out on the coming boom, and may even forfeit its SFB leases when they expire at the conclusion of 2026, a development which would render its shares worthless.  Let's all hope that HB's efforts forestall this dismal prospect via suprise announcements prior to June 1.",

          "content": "Lower oil prices presented tough conditions for many explorers and producers through 2025. Brent crude fell by more than 15pc to trade at around $60 a barrel. Supply rose sharply as OPEC and its partners ramped up production, and more oil was produced in the US. The IEA forecasts that global oil supply will continue to exceed demand next year, by an average of 3.84 million barrels per day. But the organisation\u2019s most recent report indicates higher demand is reducing the imbalance. Breakthrough US trade deals have encouraged global economic sentiment after tariff-related tensions hit consumption earlier in the year. New and continued sanctions on major suppliers such as Venezuela and Russia have constrained supply. The IEA expects the phenomenon of \u2018parallel markets\u2019, in which ample crude supply is juxtaposed with tight fuel markets, to persist into the new year. Continued oversupply means the environment for high-cost oil production, frontier exploration and speculative expansion will continue to be unfavourable. But the prospects for natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are much brighter, driven by demand from Asia, continued energy-security concerns in Europe, and coal-to-gas switching. Gas continues to gain importance as a transition fuel for power generation, industry and heating. Long-term LNG contracts signed over recent years are now translating into new capacity and more stable cash flows. Companies exposed to LNG exports, gas-weighted production and gas infrastructure are well positioned to benefit. Investors should look closely at energy services and efficiency-focused technology. With capital discipline a priority, producers are spending less on aggressive expansion and more on improving productivity, reducing costs and extending the life of existing assets. Digitalisation, automation, drilling optimisation and emissions-reduction technologies are gaining importance, shifting growth in services away from volume-driven drilling and toward smarter, more efficient operations. And carbon capture and storage, blue hydrogen and methane-reduction initiatives are attracting increasing investment as companies respond to regulatory pressure and investor expectations. Conditions for North Sea producers remain bleak. With mature assets and a tax take consuming 78pc of profit, the UK\u2019s once formidable oil and gas industry is one of the world\u2019s toughest markets. There are still opportunities. Oil and gas still supplies about three-quarters of the UK\u2019s total energy demand. The Government\u2019s decision to allow drillers to develop new fields next to existing ones should encourage some new production. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates there may be an additional 1.4 bn barrels equivalent of economically feasible reserves in the North Sea relatively close to existing sites. But there is little indication that the windfall Energy Profits Levy, imposed after the Ukraine war briefly boosted profits, will be l",

It's different now, we are stuck in a range of 9-11p for now but as time presses on I am looking at appreciation here with my first target still at 15p. I am very happy with how progress is developing and look forward to a breakthrough soon.",

The temp dock, the heliport, etc will be on the cards if not already under way, so why nothing from the board here? And why nothing about Financial Close, as that is the main news, that money is sorted and funds are there to get to first oil on Sea Lion, this was more RNS-able than FID! Surely, there must be someone sniffing around. I suppose us holding up around 10p must count for something. If the board cannot do this now/next 6 months, they never will. To be honest I imagined Navitas would farm-in or take out Borders in a deal similar (but better) to the one they did with Eco, if nothing else to secure Borders and Darwin with the promise of a drill so no one else could take them out! Gideon would feel pretty foolish if someone drilled Darwin West, clipped a deeper target and suddenly they had a 1 to 2B barrel discovery on their hands, think Guyana, with multiple look a like prospects in their acreage. It would make Sea Lion look like an oil stain on a garage forecourt by comparison! Maybe it's too quiet and the wheels are in motion behind the scenes, after-all, nobody saw the deal with Eco coming, it was out of the blue, without a sniff from anyone! Fingers crossed. LTT",

I\u2019m a salesman and that meal has expired and he can no longer dine on it !! I genuinely expected an update by the end of last year with some statement of significant progress that had been made, but absolutely SFA. Suffice to say it became clear that no update was coming as we approached Dec. As you\u2019ve said, I am glad Calgary haven\u2019t sold any shares and this gives me some optimism, but we need to see some actual progress with an update in the first half of 2026 or they will be coming to us cap in hand again, with only a shakey nail to hang the f\u2019ing cap on.

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it. Still, I have my fingers crossed hoping for the best, but planning for something else. Good luck to us all, it would be about time. LTT",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

It\u2019s not really a huge mystery. What I find interesting is that pi\u2019s would sell their shares when Calgary are adding shares. But each to their own. Your position on license renewal is comical. So your logic is that we won\u2019t get them renewed because they\u2019ve been renewed previously\u2026 I\u2019ll leave you to ponder this sentence and see if you can find the obvious flaw in your logic !! But you are right on lack of any substantive progress, and this has almost certainly got some pi\u2019s nervous. I am less than happy that there was no significant company update before year end.

The temp dock, the heliport, etc will be on the cards if not already under way, so why nothing from the board here? And why nothing about Financial Close, as that is the main news, that money is sorted and funds are there to get to first oil on Sea Lion, this was more RNS-able than FID! Surely, there must be someone sniffing around. I suppose us holding up around 10p must count for something. If the board cannot do this now/next 6 months, they never will. To be honest I imagined Navitas would farm-in or take out Borders in a deal similar (but better) to the one they did with Eco, if nothing else to secure Borders and Darwin with the promise of a drill so no one else could take them out! Gideon would feel pretty foolish if someone drilled Darwin West, clipped a deeper target and suddenly they had a 1 to 2B barrel discovery on their hands, think Guyana, with multiple look a like prospects in their acreage. It would make Sea Lion look like an oil stain on a garage forecourt by comparison! Maybe it's too quiet and the wheels are in motion behind the scenes, after-all, nobody saw the deal with Eco coming, it was out of the blue, without a sniff from anyone! Fingers crossed. LTT",

I\u2019m a salesman and that meal has expired and he can no longer dine on it !! I genuinely expected an update by the end of last year with some statement of significant progress that had been made, but absolutely SFA. Suffice to say it became clear that no update was coming as we approached Dec. As you\u2019ve said, I am glad Calgary haven\u2019t sold any shares and this gives me some optimism, but we need to see some actual progress with an update in the first half of 2026 or they will be coming to us cap in hand again, with only a shakey nail to hang the f\u2019ing cap on.

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it. Still, I have my fingers crossed hoping for the best, but planning for something else. Good luck to us all, it would be about time. LTT",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

It\u2019s not really a huge mystery. What I find interesting is that pi\u2019s would sell their shares when Calgary are adding shares. But each to their own. Your position on license renewal is comical. So your logic is that we won\u2019t get them renewed because they\u2019ve been renewed previously\u2026 I\u2019ll leave you to ponder this sentence and see if you can find the obvious flaw in your logic !! But you are right on lack of any substantive progress, and this has almost certainly got some pi\u2019s nervous. I am less than happy that there was no significant company update before year end. So I hope to see real progress and an update soon.",

We need to look at time since RKH FID announcement and nothing prior, great conversations have been had for many years with nothing forthcoming . Then RKH FID was looking likely and we had our new investment bank doing the rounds, HL are the only company that can knock on every door for a chat and the door always opens. Progress has been established with more companies, different companies than before-but the real solid thing needed was RKH FID to get our deal over the line. That's now here so the conversations  are getting down to the finer details........Only the pi's are reducing here, the bigger investors are increasing thanks to them. My view is always follow the real money and be patient, the only other confirmed discovery in the FI with 470 million barrels recoverable and billions with HCOS in our licence area won't be ignored in the newest oil province now established.",

Since then, silence, apart from the RNS mentioning FID on Sea Lion for Navitas and RKH. In fact the last meaningful announcement appears to be on the Half yearly report on the 24th of September that said, among other things; \"During the first half of 2025 we have continued to move our farm out discussions forward. Darwin continues to elicit fresh and renewed interest from potential tier one industry partners and we are delighted with the progress that Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank we appointed to run the farm out process, is making.\" We are now 4 months out from that RNS and nothing is forthcoming.

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it. Still, I have my fingers crossed hoping for the best, but planning for something else. Good luck to us all, it would be about time. LTT",

Your position on license renewal is comical. So your logic is that we won\u2019t get them renewed because they\u2019ve been renewed previously\u2026 I\u2019ll leave you to ponder this sentence and see if you can find the obvious flaw in your logic !!

Then RKH FID was looking likely and we had our new investment bank doing the rounds, HL are the only company that can knock on every door for a chat and the door always opens. Progress has been established with more companies, different companies than before-but the real solid thing needed was RKH FID to get our deal over the line. That's now here so the conversations  are getting down to the finer details........Only the pi's are reducing here, the bigger investors are increasing thanks to them. My view is always follow the real money and be patient, the only other confirmed discovery in the FI with 470 million barrels recoverable and billions with HCOS in our licence area won't be ignored in the newest oil province now established.",

In fact the last meaningful announcement appears to be on the Half yearly report on the 24th of September that said, among other things; \"During the first half of 2025 we have continued to move our farm out discussions forward. Darwin continues to elicit fresh and renewed interest from potential tier one industry partners and we are delighted with the progress that Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank we appointed to run the farm out process, is making.\" We are now 4 months out from that RNS and nothing is forthcoming.

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it. Still, I have my fingers crossed hoping for the best, but planning for something else. Good luck to us all, it would be about time. LTT",

Your position on license renewal is comical. So your logic is that we won\u2019t get them renewed because they\u2019ve been renewed previously\u2026 I\u2019ll leave you to ponder this sentence and see if you can find the obvious flaw in your logic !!

I am more inclined to a buy-out/takeover rather than a farm-in, as then there won\u2019t be the hassle of waiting for Borders to raise cash for the 15-25% they are left with on any deal, to pay thier share of appraisal/exploration wells. Surely bigger players would see what happened with Argos and more recently RKH, being forced to dilute and would want to avoid such a situation if they are big enough and have cash. Carrying smaller players might not be on the cards in the Southern Basin. Still it\u2019s all getting very interesting. LTT",

In my view weak pi's as usual moving their money around, they will only be back at a higher price.

We need to look at time since RKH FID announcement and nothing prior, great conversations have been had for many years with nothing forthcoming . Then RKH FID was looking likely and we had our new investment bank doing the rounds, HL are the only company that can knock on every door for a chat and the door always opens. Progress has been established with more companies, different companies than before-but the real solid thing needed was RKH FID to get our deal over the line. That's now here so the conversations  are getting down to the finer details........Only the pi's are reducing here, the bigger investors are increasing thanks to them. My view is always follow the real money and be patient, the only other confirmed discovery in the FI with 470 million barrels recoverable and billions with HCOS in our licence area won't be ignored in the newest oil province now established.",

Since then, silence, apart from the RNS mentioning FID on Sea Lion for Navitas and RKH. In fact the last meaningful announcement appears to be on the Half yearly report on the 24th of September that said, among other things; \"During the first half of 2025 we have continued to move our farm out discussions forward. Darwin continues to elicit fresh and renewed interest from potential tier one industry partners and we are delighted with the progress that Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank we appointed to run the farm out process, is making.\" We are now 4 months out from that RNS and nothing is forthcoming.

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

Jam today would beat jam, cream with a cherry on top 3 to 5 years down the line any day. Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it. Still, I have my fingers crossed hoping for the best, but planning for something else. Good luck to us all, it would be about time. LTT",

It\u2019s not really a huge mystery. What I find interesting is that pi\u2019s would sell their shares when Calgary are adding shares. But each to their own. Your position on license renewal is comical. So your logic is that we won\u2019t get them renewed because they\u2019ve been renewed previously\u2026 I\u2019ll leave you to ponder this sentence and see if you can find the obvious flaw in your logic !! But you are right on lack of any substantive progress, and this has almost certainly got some pi\u2019s nervous. I am less than happy that there was no significant company update before year end. So I hope to see real progress and an update soon.",

Engineering studies have demonstrated that the discovery, if successfully appraised, could be commercialised by a straightforward FPSO development, utilising proven, off-the-shelf technology. The liquids would be produced and the dry gas re-injected back into the reservoir'. https://bordersandsouthern.com/darwin-gas-condensate-discovery/",

What I find very interesting is that he has done quite a large write up before any RNS! This is excellent for us as we have a chance to add while the sp is still low. Of course, it may be nothing, and he says it depends on the farm out,  but he does have a nose for these sorts of things and being friendly with Harry Baker who appeared to clam up is a tell tale sign something could be in the  air.  Malcy has been through the presentation on Darwin so he knows how lucrative this could turn out to be. He is not ramping it but giving risk/reward opinion. Isn't that why people invest in plays like this? If there was no risk the sp would have flown away already! In my opinion only; I am almost 100% certain one of the majors will seize the opportunity of capitalising on the discovery, this is not a wild cat, especially now that things are getting going at Rockhopper. Incidentally, May 10th 2010 I made \u00a390k on the Sea Lion discovery - bought RKH at circa 30p and sold at \u00a33.80. I hoping for something along those lines here.",

Can you seriously see him giving that up to find out what voters really want. At present he is saying those with no children should be taxed extra; these knee jerk policies by Reform members have no bearing on reality.  How could Farage be PM when he is always jetting off to the US to sit at Trump's feet, it's an insult to the Brits who voted for him. He's never done a Clacton surgery. Both my parents were born in the UK, I was born in Sri Lanka as my Dad was  a Squadron Leader and was stationed there in the 1950s. As far as Reform are concerned I am not British as I was not born here. They are a divisive party and the FTSE is more likely to go down 50% than go up if Reform were to try and form a government.",

I am more inclined to a buy-out/takeover rather than a farm-in, as then there won\u2019t be the hassle of waiting for Borders to raise cash for the 15-25% they are left with on any deal, to pay thier share of appraisal/exploration wells. Surely bigger players would see what happened with Argos and more recently RKH, being forced to dilute and would want to avoid such a situation if they are big enough and have cash. Carrying smaller players might not be on the cards in the Southern Basin. Still it\u2019s all getting very interesting. LTT",

Then RKH FID was looking likely and we had our new investment bank doing the rounds, HL are the only company that can knock on every door for a chat and the door always opens. Progress has been established with more companies, different companies than before-but the real solid thing needed was RKH FID to get our deal over the line. That's now here so the conversations  are getting down to the finer details........Only the pi's are reducing here, the bigger investors are increasing thanks to them. My view is always follow the real money and be patient, the only other confirmed discovery in the FI with 470 million barrels recoverable and billions with HCOS in our licence area won't be ignored in the newest oil province now established.",

Since then, silence, apart from the RNS mentioning FID on Sea Lion for Navitas and RKH. In fact the last meaningful announcement appears to be on the Half yearly report on the 24th of September that said, among other things; \"During the first half of 2025 we have continued to move our farm out discussions forward. Darwin continues to elicit fresh and renewed interest from potential tier one industry partners and we are delighted with the progress that Houlihan Lokey, the investment bank we appointed to run the farm out process, is making.\" We are now 4 months out from that RNS and nothing is forthcoming.

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it. Still, I have my fingers crossed hoping for the best, but planning for something else. Good luck to us all, it would be about time. LTT",

Your position on license renewal is comical. So your logic is that we won\u2019t get them renewed because they\u2019ve been renewed previously\u2026 I\u2019ll leave you to ponder this sentence and see if you can find the obvious flaw in your logic !!

Engineering studies have demonstrated that the discovery, if successfully appraised, could be commercialised by a straightforward FPSO development, utilising proven, off-the-shelf technology. The liquids would be produced and the dry gas re-injected back into the reservoir'. https://bordersandsouthern.com/darwin-gas-condensate-discovery/",

What I find very interesting is that he has done quite a large write up before any RNS! This is excellent for us as we have a chance to add while the sp is still low. Of course, it may be nothing, and he says it depends on the farm out,  but he does have a nose for these sorts of things and being friendly with Harry Baker who appeared to clam up is a tell tale sign something could be in the  air.  Malcy has been through the presentation on Darwin so he knows how lucrative this could turn out to be. He is not ramping it but giving risk/reward opinion. Isn't that why people invest in plays like this? If there was no risk the sp would have flown away already! In my opinion only; I am almost 100% certain one of the majors will seize the opportunity of capitalising on the discovery, this is not a wild cat, especially now that things are getting going at Rockhopper. Incidentally, May 10th 2010 I made \u00a390k on the Sea Lion discovery - bought RKH at circa 30p and sold at \u00a33.80. I hoping for something along those lines here.",

Both my parents were born in the UK, I was born in Sri Lanka as my Dad was  a Squadron Leader and was stationed there in the 1950s.

I am more inclined to a buy-out/takeover rather than a farm-in, as then there won\u2019t be the hassle of waiting for Borders to raise cash for the 15-25% they are left with on any deal, to pay thier share of appraisal/exploration wells. Surely bigger players would see what happened with Argos and more recently RKH, being forced to dilute and would want to avoid such a situation if they are big enough and have cash. Carrying smaller players might not be on the cards in the Southern Basin. Still it\u2019s all getting very interesting. LTT",

Then RKH FID was looking likely and we had our new investment bank doing the rounds, HL are the only company that can knock on every door for a chat and the door always opens. Progress has been established with more companies, different companies than before-but the real solid thing needed was RKH FID to get our deal over the line. That's now here so the conversations  are getting down to the finer details........Only the pi's are reducing here, the bigger investors are increasing thanks to them.

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it.

Engineering studies have demonstrated that the discovery, if successfully appraised, could be commercialised by a straightforward FPSO development, utilising proven, off-the-shelf technology. The liquids would be produced and the dry gas re-injected back into the reservoir'. https://bordersandsouthern.com/darwin-gas-condensate-discovery/",

What I find very interesting is that he has done quite a large write up before any RNS! This is excellent for us as we have a chance to add while the sp is still low. Of course, it may be nothing, and he says it depends on the farm out,  but he does have a nose for these sorts of things and being friendly with Harry Baker who appeared to clam up is a tell tale sign something could be in the  air.  Malcy has been through the presentation on Darwin so he knows how lucrative this could turn out to be. He is not ramping it but giving risk/reward opinion. Isn't that why people invest in plays like this? If there was no risk the sp would have flown away already! In my opinion only; I am almost 100% certain one of the majors will seize the opportunity of capitalising on the discovery, this is not a wild cat, especially now that things are getting going at Rockhopper. Incidentally, May 10th 2010 I made \u00a390k on the Sea Lion discovery - bought RKH at circa 30p and sold at \u00a33.80. I hoping for something along those lines here.",

How could Farage be PM when he is always jetting off to the US to sit at Trump's feet, it's an insult to the Brits who voted for him. He's never done a Clacton surgery. Both my parents were born in the UK, I was born in Sri Lanka as my Dad was  a Squadron Leader and was stationed there in the 1950s. As far as Reform are concerned I am not British as I was not born here. They are a divisive party and the FTSE is more likely to go down 50% than go up if Reform were to try and form a government.",

I am more inclined to a buy-out/takeover rather than a farm-in, as then there won\u2019t be the hassle of waiting for Borders to raise cash for the 15-25% they are left with on any deal, to pay thier share of appraisal/exploration wells. Surely bigger players would see what happened with Argos and more recently RKH, being forced to dilute and would want to avoid such a situation if they are big enough and have cash. Carrying smaller players might not be on the cards in the Southern Basin. Still it\u2019s all getting very interesting. LTT",

Then RKH FID was looking likely and we had our new investment bank doing the rounds, HL are the only company that can knock on every door for a chat and the door always opens. Progress has been established with more companies, different companies than before-but the real solid thing needed was RKH FID to get our deal over the line. That's now here so the conversations  are getting down to the finer details........Only the pi's are reducing here, the bigger investors are increasing thanks to them.

But as you say it all needs to be proved up with an appraisal and that indeed is the share price's achilles heel even though its almost a dead cert. There was some kind of flow test done according to Bruce when it was drilled and for the life of me i cant remember the terminology he put behind it but the flow rate is huge which means we need less wells to pump more (and much more than RKH waxy crude i have to say) Fact of the matter is- 40% of the company is owned by people you can count on one hand, these guys are loaded and aren't looking at selling on the cheap. Then there's the entry investors, those poor folk who paid top dollar for stock here ( those up to 80p odd per share). Then there's the less than notified holders who add up to a substantial holding that wont sell on the cheap either. This then leaves a minority in my opinion for any reasonable deal. You need to remember that RKH  already got an upfront payment of 230 million dollars and 722 million development funding (which didnt happen) for their first farmout, hence why they got nothing upfront again for the second one! The scenario is totally different here,  lets see what transpires!",

So, working on the assumption a player would pay 50p a barrel for lets say 260m barrels, nothing for Darwin West as it's just a bright spot on seismic, then you have about 26p a share. Maybe add on an extra 5p for the other prospects and Darwin West and you are looking at 31p a share. I think a lot of folk would got for that I'm afraid. If you consider that RKH got nothing per barrel for giving away 65% on their entire acreage on a fully appraised Sea Lion and a discovery on Isobel, yet to be appraised, for a loan that pays 66% for their cost to first oil, we would be extremely lucky to get an offer over 40p. Never say never, I would be over the moon with an offer of 50p a share, but I also have to be realistic and look around. In this climate of anti oil and anti investment in oil, whom would have thought RKH would be at 66p with first oil in 2 years with the funds and the partner to do it? Crazy times. LTT",

Of course, I\u2019d prefer something different, some cash and shares of the take over company, to keep some skin in the game, similar deal to Eco, but with maybe 10p per share and keeping a 25% stake, but alas, it seems unlikely the more I think about it.
