      "Zero volatility coupled with a sharp momentum increase suggests algorithmic or bot\u2011driven activity rather than organic market interest.",
      "The combination of a 93.7% drawdown to a 0.00p entry price and a base score of 10/21 indicates the model is treating the ticker as a near\u2011zero\u2011value asset, potentially flagging it for a forced delisting or liquidation."

      "Liquidity risk: zero ATR and StdDev mean no observable price movement, making any trade highly illiquid and susceptible to price manipulation.",
