      "The crash signal reports a 93.7\u202f% drawdown from peak but lists an entry price of 0.00\u202fp, implying the company may have been delisted and subsequently re\u2011issued or that the price data is corrupted.",
      "Absence of any social posts or sentiment data, coupled with zero volatility metrics, indicates the stock is either not trading or is being held in a dormant state, which is a red flag for potential regulatory or liquidity issues."

    "hidden_patterns": [
      "Cross\u2011signal conflict: Google Trends shows a dead ticker but also high momentum, while all other metrics (price, volatility, sentiment, RNS) are null. This mismatch points to a possible automated relisting or a mis\u2011tagged ticker.",
      "Temporal anomaly: The crash signal\u2019s base score of 10/21 is moderate, yet the drawdown is extreme (93.7\u202f%). Such a disparity often occurs when a company experiences a sudden regulatory change (e.g., delisting, bankruptcy filing) that is not reflected in the market data."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [
      "The +333\u202f% momentum in Google Trends, despite zero trading activity, could signal a latent short\u2011squeeze or a planned relisting that institutional traders are quietly positioning for.",
      "A zero price with a high drawdown percentage suggests that the last recorded price was above 0.00\u202fp; a re\u2011issue at 0.00\u202fp could create a massive upside if the company resumes trading."
    ],
    "risk_warnings": [
      "Zero trading volume and zero volatility metrics mean the stock is illiquid and may be subject to manipulation or regulatory intervention.",
      "No RNS or catalysts means there is no public disclosure of the company\u2019s fundamentals, heightening the risk of fraud or undisclosed financial distress.",
      "The mismatch between Google Trends and market data could indicate data feed errors; relying on such signals without confirmation could lead to misinformed trades."
    ],
    "opportunity_flags": [
      "If the company is indeed relisting, the current 0.00\u202fp price could represent a steep discount to the true value, offering a high\u2011leverage play for those willing to accept extreme liquidity risk.",

    "narrative_summary": "THRU.L appears to be a dormant, possibly delisted AIM stock with no active trading data or disclosures, yet Google Trends flags a sudden spike in momentum. This inconsistency signals either a data feed error or a pending relisting that could create a contrarian upside. However, the absence of price, volume, and corporate communications presents significant liquidity and regulatory risks, making the stock suitable only for highly speculative, short\u2011term traders."
