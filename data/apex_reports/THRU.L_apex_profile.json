      "The 93.7\u202f% drawdown from an undefined peak indicates the stock once traded at a nominal value but collapsed almost to zero; the absence of any current price suggests the shares may have been delisted or suspended.",
      "Cross\u2011signal conflict: a severe crash signal coexists with a positive Google Trends momentum, implying either an anomalous data feed or a potential short\u2011squeeze scenario if the stock were to be re\u2011listed."

      "The Google Trends interpretation \u201cDead_ticker \u2013 UP\u201d is a paradoxical flag that appears in the database when a ticker is removed but the search query still surfaces; this suggests the ticker may be in the process of being delisted or re\u2011introduced."
