In response, the Board continued to review a range of potential investment opportunities, including in South America, allowing it to further refine its investment strategy and broaden its outlook. This ongoing assessment has helped the Company to better balance the pursuit of new funding sources with the development of structured investments that align with its investing policy. In parallel, the Company is actively exploring alternative funding routes to unlock its investment potential and to enable the timely execution of its investment opportunities.\nThe Board continues to support its investment strategy of investing in sectors shaped by long-term demographic shifts, which include factors such as ageing populations, urbanisation, generational changes in consumer behaviour and the evolving nature of work. These trends are structural rather than cyclical, and we believe they will be central to future demand, innovation, and sustainable growth and include industries such as agritech, driven by consumption changes or global warming, digital transformation which may include artificial intelligence, financial technology or general growth in global connectivity and healthcare. These are not exhaustive and the Board considered the rapid rate of change in South America to offer a wealth of opportunities that are already adopted in more developed countries.\nAs previously announced, the Company will be working within its existing investing strategy, and the investment approach now centres on two complementary pillars:\n1. we are actively pursuing roll-up opportunities in fragmented sectors where the Board considers that consolidation can unlock operational efficiencies, increase market share and build platform value; and\n2. we are investing in the digital transformation of traditional industries, where automation, data, and technology remain underutilised, yet are essential drivers of productivity and long-term resilience.\nWe consider this dual focus will enables us to identify and scale businesses that are both undervalued and structurally sound, where effective management and access to capital can accelerate their growth. Operating within this framework, our deal pipeline has improved in both quality and depth, and we look forward to the next stage of the Company\u2019s development where we will be deploying resources into opportunities aligned with our strategic thesis.\nOutlook\nThe Board looks forward to the coming period with enthusiasm and to updating shareholders with the Company\u2019s developments.\nEdgar J.

Typically, Pacific Global invests in small companies where there are clear catalysts for value appreciation and the companies are operating in sectors exhibiting long term growth linked to demographic change.\n2. Accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies have all been applied consistently throughout the period covered and have not changed since being reported on in the financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2025.\nBasis of preparation\nThe interim financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.

With his appointment, he brings significant investment experience, access to investment opportunities in\nSouth America\nthat fit very well within the Company\u2019s investing strategy and industry contacts to structure and fund investment mandates\nDuring the course of the year, the board has reviewed a number of potential investments which has helped it to refine its investment approach and broaden its outlook to balance sources of new funding with structured investments that will work within the Company\u2019s investing policy.\nAs previously announced, we have been disappointed with the performance of some of our legacy investments. In conjunction with the boards renewed focus, we undertook a careful review of the existing portfolio and wrote-off several underperforming and non-aligned legacy investments being Oncocyte (Chronix) and Saxa Gres.\nThe board continues to support its investment strategy of investing in sectors shaped by long-term demographic shifts, which include factors such as ageing populations, urbanisation, generational changes in consumer behaviour and the evolving nature of work. These trends are structural rather than cyclical, and we believe they will be central to future demand, innovation, and sustainable growth and include industries such as agritech driving by consumption changes or global warming, digital transformation which may include artificial intelligence, financial technology or general growth in global connectivity and healthcare. These are not exhaustive and the board considered the rapid rate of change in\nSouth America\nto offer a wealth of opportunities that are already adopted in more developed countries.\nWorking within our existing investing strategy, our investment approach now centres on two complementary pillars:\nwe are actively pursuing roll-up opportunities in fragmented sectors where the board considers consolidation can unlock operational efficiencies, increase market share and build platform value; and\nwe are investing in the digital transformation of traditional industries, where automation, data, and technology remain underutilised yet are essential drivers of productivity and long-term resilience.\nWe consider this dual focus will enables us to identify and scale businesses that are both undervalued and structurally sound, where effective management and access to capital can accelerate their growth. Operating within this framework, out deal pipeline has improved in both quality and depth, and we look forward to the next stage of the Company\u2019s development where we will be deploying resources into opportunities aligned with our strategic thesis.\nOn behalf of the board, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued trust and support. We remain firmly committed to transparency, disciplined performance, and building a company that earns and rewards your confidence and we look forward to providing the market with updates on potential investee companies.\nEdgar J.
