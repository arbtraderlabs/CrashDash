ON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE (\"RIS\"), THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nGS CHAIN PLC\n(\"GS Chain\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nCorporate Update\nGS Chain Plc wishes to provide shareholders with an update as it approaches the end of 2025 and prepares for the year ahead. The Board has continued to focus on progressing the Company's stated strategy and believes that 2026 has the potential to be an important year for the business.\nRefinancing and Strategic Focus\nOn 16 October 2025 the Company announced that it had entered into a convertible investment agreement which provided \u00a3300,000 of new funding. This refinancing has strengthened the Company's position and given it enhanced credibility as it continues its work to identify and secure a suitable reverse takeover target. The additional resources ensure that the Company remains operationally ready to progress a transaction efficiently once the right opportunity is selected.\nThe Board recognises that the Company has been engaged in its search for some time. However a disciplined approach remains essential. The Board will only proceed with a transaction that meets its quality threshold and offers the right characteristics to deliver long term value for shareholders.\nCorporate Positioning\nThe Company remains focused on its mandate to identify a business with long term growth characteristics and the potential to deliver meaningful value creation for shareholders.\nThroughout the year the Company has continued to work actively with its advisers as part of its efforts to source, filter and assess potential reverse takeover candidates. This collaboration has supported the Company's ongoing evaluation work and its preparations for a potential transaction. The Board extends its thanks to the advisory teams for their continued efforts during the year.\nPipeline and Opportunity Review\nThe Company continues to work closely with its advisers to assess a number of potential opportunities across sectors aligned with its stated mandate. Several discussions and preliminary reviews are ongoing. These remain at varying stages of evaluation and the Company will update shareholders as soon as there is material progress. The Board remains encouraged by the breadth and quality of opportunities available and is committed to ensuring that appropriate due diligence is completed before any decision is taken.\nBoard Strengthening, Governance and Control\nAs part of its preparations for a potential transaction the Company is taking steps to strengthen its Board. It is interviewing strong well qualified candidates who would bring the level of experience and standing required to support the execution of a successful reverse takeover. The Board believes that broadening the depth and capability of its governance framework will position the Company more effectively for the next stage of its development.\nIn parallel the Company continues to maintain appropriate governance processes and controls as it advances its strategic objectives. These include regular engagement with advisers and a continued focus on ensuring that the Company remains fully compliant with its corporate and regulatory obligations.\nFinancial Discipline\nThe Company continues to manage its resources carefully so that it is well positioned to act when a suitable transaction is identified. This measured approach enables the Company to progress its strategy while maintaining the flexibility required to complete a reverse takeover on appropriate terms.\nMarket Environment\nThe Board notes that the current market environment for growth stage and technology led transactions remains constructive. While conditions have been mixed in recent years there is renewed activity and interest across several relevant sectors. This supports the Company's ongoing efforts to identify a target that aligns with its strategy and has the potential to deliver sustainable value creation.\nAGM Preparations\nThe Company is making preparations for its forthcoming annual general meeting and looks forward to engaging with shareholders. The Board welcomes the opportunity to answer any questions shareholders may have and to provide further commentary on the Company's progress. The AGM circular will be posted shortly and the Company will provide further detail in due course.\nAmendment to Audited Results\nOn 31 October 2025 the Company announced its annual results.

It sets out the strategy, business model, key performance indicators, principal risks, and outlook for GS Chain Plc ('the Company'), being a public limited company listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nBusiness Overview and Model\nGS Chain Plc was established as a listed investment vehicle focused on identifying and acquiring a target business or asset within the technology, digital, fintech, blockchain and AI sectors. The Company aims to generate long-term shareholder value by leveraging its listed status to acquire businesses with sustainable growth potential.\nThe Company's business model is designed around three core principles:\n-\nIdentifying attractive acquisition opportunities in high-growth markets.\n-\nApplying rigorous, effective and targeted due diligence and financial discipline in target evaluation.\n-\nCreating post-acquisition value through value-add activities, active governance and strategic oversight.\n-\nAfter an acquisition is made the role of the Board will be to empower and enable the senior management team of the acquired business, whilst monitoring and controlling progress and delivery.\nStrategy and Objectives\nThe primary objective of GS Chain Plc is to complete a qualifying acquisition that enhances shareholder value and establishes a sustainable operational platform. In the absence of an immediate acquisition, the Board continues to focus on maintaining financial discipline and compliance with Main Market obligations.\nKey strategic objectives include\n:\n-\nIdentifying and assessing acquisition targets with strong management and scalable business models together with the execution ability and access to necessary resources to deliver the growth required.\n-\nPreserving capital and maintaining an efficient cost structure while in the pre-acquisition phase.\n-\nStrengthening the Company's governance, reporting, and investor relations framework.\n-\nEnsuring compliance with all regulatory and market requirements applicable to a Main Market-listed company.\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nGiven the Company's pre-acquisition status, financial performance indicators remain limited.\nThe Board monitors key metrics\nincluding:\n-\nCash balance and cash runway - to ensure sufficient resources for ongoing operations.\n-\nAdministrative cost base - to maintain efficient stewardship of shareholder funds.\n-\nShare price performance and liquidity - as an indicator of market confidence.\n-\nAbility to raise funds effectively and in a timely manner for the cash resources of the company.\n-\nProgress towards identifying and engaging suitable acquisition targets.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Board recognises that as listed investment vehicle, the Company is exposed to certain inherent risks.\nThe\nprincipal risks and uncertainties\ninclude:\n-\nAcquisition Risk: Inability to identify or complete a suitable acquisition within a reasonable timeframe.\n-\nMarket Risk: Volatility in equity markets impacting valuation and investor sentiment.\n-\nRegulatory and Compliance Risk: Evolving corporate governance and disclosure obligations under FCA and LSE rules.\n-\nLiquidity and Capital Management: Efficient utilisation of capital while maintaining operational flexibility.\n-\nReputation Risk: The impact of deal execution or market perception on investor confidence.\nFinancial Review\nFor the year under review, the Company maintained a prudent approach to financial management. Administrative expenses were reduced from \u00a3352,537 in year end 30 June 2024 to \u00a3215,963 this year ended 30 June 2025, representing a reduction of 38% year on year.\nAccordingly, the Company reported a net loss of approximately \u00a3215,963 this year, down from \u00a3357,330 last year. This reflects the Board's desire to use the company's resources wisely and effectively before it successfully acquires a suitable business by RTO.\nCash and cash equivalents were more than sufficient to support ongoing acquisition search and corporate compliance activities. The company has also improved its fundraising agility as shown by the recent announcement of \u00a3300,000 of new investment as announced post year-end on 16 September 2025.\nIn the post-year end period, the Board will also continue to look at ways to reduce and pay down historical liabilities, whether that be for previous director payables, or director loans. The Board continues to monitor expenditure closely for necessity and impact, and more effectively secure more funding options to support intended and purposeful acquisition activity.\nThere are more details of the Financial Review in the section entitled Financial Review provided by the COO, Sebastien Guerin, starting on page 6.\nESG and Corporate Responsibility\nWhile the Company is currently in the pre-acquisition phase, the Board is still committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical conduct. Future acquisitions will be assessed not only on financial merit but also on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credentials. The Company supports responsible, ethical and sustainable investment principles consistent with long-term value creation.\nThe are more\nESG\ndetails available in the CEO's Statement on page 5.\nOutlook\nThe near-term focus of the remains on not only identifying and executing a suitable acquisition, but improving our execution ability in this respect, and aligning agile funding strategies to support a suitable acquisition in due course. The Board continues to engage with capable and proven advisors and potential counterparties within the technology, fintech, digital innovation, blockchain and related AI sectors. Despite prevailing economic uncertainty, the directors are confident that the Company's listed structure, and disciplined approach will position it well to deliver value to shareholders over the medium term.\nSection 172(1) Statement\nThe Directors of GS Chain Plc (\"the Company\") are mindful of their duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way they consider, in good faith, would most likely promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard (amongst other matters) to:\n-\nthe likely consequences of any decision in the long term;\n-\nthe interests of the Company's employees;\n-\nthe need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;\n-\nthe impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment;\n-\nthe desirability of maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and\n-\nthe need to act fairly as between members of the Company.\nThe Board recognises that its decisions can have a significant impact on stakeholders and seeks to ensure that stakeholder views are considered as part of Board discussions and decision-making.\nHow the Board Engages with Stakeholders\nThe Board identifies the Company's key stakeholders as its shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, and the wider communities in which we operate. Engagement takes place through:\n-\nRegular communications and discussion with:\n-\nKey Shareholders\n-\nKey Suppliers and Professionals\n-\nBy responding to and engaging with any approach or complaint from key stakeholders (during the year ended 30/06/2025 no such complaints were received from any stakeholders).\n-\nThe company has no employees apart from the directors.\nExamples of Decisions in the Year ended 30 June 2025 reflecting s.172 Considerations\n-\nInvestment decision\n- After the year-end, the Board accepted fresh investment of \u00a3300,000 into the company by way of convertible loan note, which was announced via RNS on 16th October 2025. The Board approved this investment after reviewing short- and medium-term liquidity in the company, long-term value creation through the improvement of the company's ability to procure and successfully execute a suitable RTO transaction within the timeframes allowed and took key stakeholder feedback into consideration.\nLong-Term Success and Culture\nThe Board believes that effective stakeholder engagement, a strong ethical culture, and a long-term strategic approach are integral to promoting the success of the Company. The Board regularly reviews key metrics and stakeholder feedback to ensure decisions align with these objectives.\nApproval\nThis Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 7 November 2025 and signed on its behalf by:\nLeon Filipovic\nChief Executive Officer\nGS Chain PLC\nCEO's STATEMENT\nBusiness strategy and objective\nThe Company remains focused on identifying and acquiring businesses within the technology sector, particularly those utilising advanced technologies in fintech, banking, finance, and blockchain. Through ongoing due diligence and disciplined execution, we continue to seek acquisition targets that align with our growth strategy, ensuring both short-term impact and long-term sustainability.\nWhile the Board of Directors draws from a diverse range of industry expertise, our efforts have been concentrated on technology-driven sectors. The Board remains open to considering other industries if they offer strong potential for value creation and complement the Company's objectives. The Company has made some changes to the Board of Directors in the interest of efficiency and in preparation for the addition of new Board members as we further develop and intensify our acquisition efforts. These are detailed in the Board of Directors section.\nBuilding on the foundations established since our listing, GS Chain Plc is dedicated to creating enduring shareholder value by acquiring high-quality companies with strong growth potential. The experience and industry knowledge of the Board and its advisors as both evolve, will continue to guide us in capitalizing on strategic opportunities for sustained success.\nReview of activities for the year ended 30 June 2025\nThe Board of Directors continues to actively evaluate potential acquisition targets that align with the Company's strategic focus. While no acquisition costs were incurred during the year ended 30 June 2025, the Company remains committed to pursuing appropriate opportunities that will enhance long-term shareholder value. We are reviewing and looking to further improve our thorough assessment process ensuring that only those companies with significant potential for growth and alignment with our technological focus are considered for acquisition.\nPost Year-End Activities:\nAs announced on the 3 September 2025, the Company confirmed that further to recent changes to the UK Listing Rules (UKLR), GS Chain PLC notes that the transitional provisions under UKLR 13 expired on 29 July 2025. UKLR 13 requires a listed shell company to complete an initial acquisition transaction within 24 months from 30 July 2025, extendable, if necessary, by shareholder approval. To give effect to these provisions, companies are required to amend their constitutions to include the relevant timeframes. This aligns with the Company's strategic goal to complete an acquisition in advance of the 29 July 2027 deadline.\nThis allows the Company adequate time for GS Chain Plc's ongoing strategy, operational effectiveness, and future prospects. The Company's shares continue to trade on the London Main Market, our focus remains on identifying and executing acquisitions within the technology sector, specifically targeting fintech, banking, finance, and blockchain industries including AI additions.\nAs announced on 16 September 2025, GS Chain PLC has entered into a Convertible Investment Agreement with a family office, Citymeade Limited, securing an initial investment of \u00a3300,000 mainly to support working capital. The company is delighted to secure this investment, as the first stage of a series of significant new investments that the company plans to raise in 2025-2026. The company welcomes Citymeade to the GS Chain family.\nTransparency and open communication remain a top priority, and we will continue to update our stakeholders on any further developments through the required channels.\nBoard of Directors\nGS Chain Plc has changed the composition of the Board during the year to reflect the evolving needs of the Company. The Board now continues to provide strong governance and direction, leveraging its collective expertise to drive the Company's growth and long-term objectives.\nFurthermore, the company is looking to enhance its Board's effectiveness going forward and will look to make suitable additions or changes as the company continues to evolve into the 2025-2026 financial year.\nLeon Filipovic\nChief Executive Officer\nDate: 7 November 2025\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nLoss for the year\nFor the year the Company recorded a loss of \u00a3 217,613 (2024: \u00a3357,330 loss).

Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Chief Operating Officer prepares and presents a cashflow, expenditure and balance sheet projection for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements which is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Directors take into account this information and all other available factors for the foreseeable future, in particular for the twelve months from the date of approval of the financial information.\nThe Company has cash reserves of \u00a3569,794 as of 30 June 2025. Post year-end, the company has secured fresh investment of \u00a3300,000 from a family office Citymeade Limited, primarily to augment working capital as announced on 16 September 2025. This is the first in a series of targeted new investments that the company plans to raise.\nEnergy and carbon reporting\nThe Company recognises it has a responsibility to the environment and endeavours to be as environmentally friendly as possible in its business activities. As the Company has consumed less than 40 MWh of energy in the UK, the low energy exemption has been applied. In assessing whether the threshold was met, the Company has considered all energy from gas, electricity, and transport usage as required by the UK Government's Guidance on Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting.\nStatement of Director's responsibilities\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Report of the Directors and the financial statements in\naccordance with applicable law and regulations.\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n-\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n-\nmake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n-\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nStatement as to Disclosure of Information to Auditors\nSo far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company's auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\nAuditors\nThe auditors, Macalvins Limited, have expressed their willingness to continue in office and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\nThe maintenance and integrity of the GS Chain Plc website is the responsibility of the Directors.\nThe CEO's statement and Financial Review, all of which are incorporated into this report, include a true and fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategies.\nThe financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the issuer.\nOn behalf of the board\nLeon Filipovic\nDirector (Chairman & CEO)\nDate: 7 November 2025\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\nIntroduction\nThe Board is committed to good corporate governance and because it is a Company listed on the Standard Segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority, the Company is required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Having said that, the company will look to add additional Board members in the 2025-2026 financial year, and will look to broaden its diversity, subject to the above.\nAs the Company only has 3 employees, which solely comprise the Board of directors, no data collection methodology has been required.\nAccountability\nThe Board is committed to providing shareholders with a clear assessment of the Company's position and prospects.

The committee oversees the Company's financial reporting and internal controls and provides a formal reporting link with the external auditors. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and the half-yearly reports remains with the Board. The Audit Committee meets not less than twice in each financial year and will have unrestricted access to the Company's external auditors. The Audit Committee is chaired by Mark Wilson, and its other member is Leon Filipovic.\nMain responsibilities\nThe Audit Committee acts as a preparatory body for discharging the Board's responsibilities in a wide\nrange of financial matters by:\n-\nMonitoring the integrity of the financial statements and formal announcements relating to the Company's financial performance;\n-\nReviewing significant financial reporting issues and accounting policies and disclosures in financial reports;\n-\nOverseeing that an effective system of internal control and risk management systems are maintained through review of these at periodic meetings of the Committee, implementing actions arising from these meetings where necessary;\n-\nEnsuring that effective whistleblowing, anti-fraud and bribery procedures are in place;\n-\nConsidering the Company's internal audit requirements and making recommendations to the Board;\n-\nOverseeing the Board's relationship with the external auditors and, where appropriate, the selection of new external auditors;\n-\nApproving non-audit services provided by the external auditors, or any other accounting firm, ensuring the independence and objectivity of the external auditors is safeguarded when appointing them to conduct non-audit services;\n-\nEnsuring compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nThe Company's external auditors are Macalvins Limited, and the Audit Committee will closely monitor the level of audit and non-audit services they provide to the Company. In the year ended 30 June 2025 Macalvins Limited performed no non-audit services for the Company.\nInternal audit function\nAs the Company is in its initial stages, and has not yet acquired any subsidiaries, and has no employees beyond the Board of Directors, the necessity of an internal audit function is not considered appropriate. The Board will review this stance and implement accordingly when necessary.\nExternal auditor\nThe Company's external auditors are Macalvins Limited. The external auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee Chairman. The Committee is satisfied that Macalvins Limited has adequate policies and safeguards in place to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence are maintained. The external auditors report to the Audit Committee annually on their independence from the Company.\nThe current auditors, Macalvins Limited were first appointed by the Company in 2022. Having assessed the performance objectively and independence of the Auditors, the Committee will be considering the reappointment of Macalvins Limited as auditors to the Company at the next annual general meeting.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT\nWe have audited the financial statements of GS Chain Plc for the year ended 30 June 2025 which comprise the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nIn our opinion:\n-\nthe financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 30 June 2025 and of the company's loss for the year then ended;\n-\nthe financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the IASB; and\n-\nthe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey audit matter\nAudit response to the key matter\nFindings\nFraud in revenue recognition\nPresumed risk under ISA 240:\nIncorrect treatment of income under IFRS.\nWe performed relevant audit procedures and specific tests to evaluate if income had been omitted from the financial statements for the current year. Our procedures included the following:\n- Review of Company Bank Statements:\nOur review of the company's bank statements did not reveal evidence of income which had been omitted and not accurately reflected in the financial statements.\n- Examination of Board Minutes:\nInspection of all board minutes did not yield any evidence of contracts that were agreed upon or acquisitions that were completed but not recorded in the financial statements, indicating that income recognition is accurate.\n- Review of RNS Filings:\nThe review of all RNS filings made since June 30, 2024, did not provide evidence that the company had completed any unrecorded acquisitions or revenue-generating agreements that would affect income recognition in the financial statements.\nThese procedures\nenabled to us to\nform an opinion that the presumed\nrisk of fraud in\nrevenue\nrecognition is\nrebuttable under\nISA 240.\nManagement override of controls\nPresumed risk under ISA 240:\nRisk of management using their position in the company to manipulate financial results and misappropriate assets.\nIn addition to the procedures described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\" of the Audit report, we audited to higher risk all areas requiring judgement, performed tests on a sample basis of journal entries exhibiting unusual characteristics, journals relating to areas of significant audit interest and incorporated unpredictability in our substantive testing procedures.\nWe assessed the appropriateness of liabilities and transactions to related parties, reviewing management's review of contracts, their identification and estimation of performance obligations, including ratification of such obligations by the board and reviewing appropriate supporting documentation.\nBased on our audit procedures performed we have not identified any instances of management override of controls.\nGoing Concern\nRisk of incorrect use of the going concern assumption based on the company's financial position arising from obligations to repay working capital loans and remuneration to the Directors, other operating losses and cash position as at 30 June 2025.\nWe performed procedures to test and assess the significant assumptions used in the working capital forecasts, including performing sensitivity analysis as detailed in the going concern section of the audit report.\nBased on the\nresult of our audit\nprocedures and\nverification of the post balance sheet\nevent, we have\nnoted our\nassessment of\ngoing concern below in our audit report.\nCash management\nRisk of misappropriation or inappropriate management of cash.\nWe reviewed external 3rd party confirmations to gain comfort over the cash balances held and identify any undisclosed liabilities and reviewed the internal risk assessment to ensure that risks associated with holding large cash balance have been completely addressed.\nBased on the\nresults of our audit\nprocedures the\ncash balances\nwere not materially\nmisstated. Given the size of the company, and the number of directors, the current cash controls, although not formally documented are appropriate. We have made a recommendation to consider enhancing formal documentation around cash controls as the company grows.\nAccounting disclosures\nRisk that IFRS and UK Corporate Governance Code are not compliant or omitted.\nWe thoroughly reviewed the accounts' disclosures to ensure that all required information was included utilising appropriate industry standard IFRS disclosure checklist and the UK corporate governance code checklist. The latter encompassed compliance with Listing rules, Disclosure and Transparency Rules pertaining to audit committees and corporate governance statements, the 2018 version of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC, FRC Guidance on Risk Management/Internal Controls, the 2016 FRC guidance on Audit Committees, the 2018 FRC guidance on Board Effectiveness, and the FRC Minimum Standards for 2023\nconcerning Audit Committees and external audit.\nFurthermore, we conducted a review of the LSE listing for company to identify any essential information requiring disclosure.\nAll disclosure\nadjustments or omissions\nassessed as\nmaterial have\nbeen corrected by\nmanagement.\nWe have\nconcluded the\nfinancial\nstatements are\nmaterially\ncompliant with\nIFRS, the UK\nCorporate\nGovernance Code, the Listing Rules and other relevant regulation.\nUnderstatement of expenses and liabilities\nRisk that expenses are understated, an incentive to understatement was identified during our risk assessment due to the company's losses and net liability position.\nThe following audit procedures were performed and included, among others:\n- Audited a sample of operating expenses and supporting\ndocumentation, vouching for the accuracy and classification of the expenses.\n- Performed analytical reviews of expenses with the prior year and obtaining explanations in respect of unexpected\nmovements.\n- Performed substantive audit procedures on creditors and\naccruals and reviewed post year end bank statements/board minutes and publicly available records for evidence of omitted expenditure/undisclosed liabilities.\n- We make enquiries of known service providers to ensure that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements were not omitted or understated.\nWe have furthermore obtained confirmation from relevant\nIndividuals and entities confirming the company's aggregate transactions with then during the period under audit and the company obligations at the year end.\nAdjustments were\nidentified in\nrespect of cost incorrectly\nrecorded as expenses which should have been\nincluded within the\ndirectors' current\naccount.\nThese have been corrected by\nmanagement and\ntherefore based\nresults of our audit\nprocedures the\nexpenses\nbalances are not\nmaterially\nmisstated.\nUndisclosed related parties\nRisk that transactions were related parties have not correctly disclosed or account for.\nThe following audit procedures were performed and included among others:\n- Reviewed directors service agreements.\n- Reviewed the company board minutes.\n- Reviewed the financial statements to ensure related party transactions are disclosed in accordance with IAS 24 Related Parties.\n- Obtained confirmations from the directors in respect of amounts due and owed to the Company.\nReviewed post year statements, minutes and other available data to assess whether any related.\nWe identified adjustments in respect of directors' fee accruals and expenses taken to the income statement which required allocation to the directors' accounts.\nManagement have corrected all material adjustments and items in respect of disclosures.\nBased results of our audit procedures the expenses balances are not materially misstated and compliant with IAS24.\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of time and efforts of the engagement team and directing the audit procedures undertaken. The identification and adjustment of the expenditure referred to in the key audit matters above were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters and did not change our assessment of key audit matters during the performance of the audit.\nOverall materiality\n\u00a322,000\nBenchmark applied\n10% of total loss for the year \u00a3217,613\nRationale for benchmark\nThe company is still at an early stage of development.\nThe main activity of the company since incorporation has been identifying an acquisition target and incurring costs in respect of public company listings.\nThe loss for the year which is due to administrative expenses has been determined to be the most appropriate basis for materiality.\nPerformance materiality\nPerformance materiality is set to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements in the financial statements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nWe set performance materiality at \u00a37,700, which represents 35% of overall materiality.\nTriviality threshold\nWe agreed with the directors that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a3525 as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nMateriality uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to the disclosures made in Note 1.2, 3 and 14 to the financial statements concerning the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The company's going concern assessment is dependent on the successful completion of further capital raise and a planned reverse takeover (RTO), expected in February and July 2026 respectively. As of the date of this report, these fundraising activities have not been formalised. Should these events not occur as intended, the company will have utilised its cash reserves by March 2026. These conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n-\nConfirm our understanding of the directors' going concern assessment process, including the controls over the review and approval of the budget and plan. We have obtained a copy of management's assessment of going concern and evidence that the assessment was approved by the Board;\n-\nAssessing the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern assessment period to 31 October 2026 and considering the existence of any significant events or conditions beyond this period based on our procedures on the company's plans and knowledge arising from other areas of the audit;\n-\nReview and verification of the inputs and assumptions used in the board approved working capital forecasts, identifying the key assumptions and evaluating the appropriateness of these assumptions.\n-\nEvaluating management's historical forecasting accuracy and the consistency of the going concern assessment with information obtained from other areas of the audit, such as our audit procedures on the company's plans;\n-\nTesting the mechanical accuracy of the going concern analysis;\n-\nConfirming the existence and availability of financing for the company's operations;\n-\nPerforming independent sensitivity analysis on management's assumptions including applying adverse cashflow sensitivities and evaluating the appropriateness of mitigating actions available to management for example deferring expenditure; and\n-\nEvaluating the disclosures on going concern.\nOur observations\nThe company is planning to complete an acquisition via reverse takeover (RTO) within the next 12 months. However, as of the date of the financial statements, the company has not entered into an agreement to acquire a company, but it does now have a fresh funding agreement as announced on 16 September 2025, and furthermore, has a series of further investment fundraises planned. There remains a possibility that the acquisition may not occur. The directors intend to secure additional investment in the event the RTO is successful. The company has raised \u00a3300,000 of additional working capital post year end, to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to remain solvent and provide a comfortable level of cash headroom. The company also expects to raise further working capital in February and July 2026; should these not materialise, the current cash reserves will be depleted by March 2026.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have identified material uncertainties relating to events or conditions noted above that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events such as the RTO can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the company's ability to continue as a going concern after any significant events including but not limited to the acquisition.\nOther information\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion of the directors' remuneration disclosure within the directors' remuneration report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n-\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n-\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n-\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n-\nthe company financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n-\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n-\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nCorporate governance statement\nOur obligation is to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern and viability of the company and review the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified in The Listing Rules.\nWe have concluded, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n-\nDirectors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified in their statement;\n-\nDirectors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out in their statement;\n-\nDirector's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out in their statement;\n-\nDirectors' statement on accountability, diversity and other matters set out in their statement;\n-\nBoard's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out in their statement;\n-\nThe section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out in their statement; and;\n-\nThe section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee set out in their statement.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 6, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n-\nthe nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the company's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n-\nresults of our enquiries of management about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities;\n-\nidentifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of noncompliance;\n-\ndetecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n-\nthe internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; and\n-\nAddressing the risks of fraud through management override of controls by performing journal entry testing.\nThese matters were discussed among the audit engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\nAs a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the company operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act and local tax legislation.\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with management. As with any audit, there remains a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal controls.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:\nwww.frc.org.uk\n. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nOther matters which we are required to address\nWe were reappointed by the directors on 21 October 2025 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2025. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is 4 years, covering the period ending 30 June 2022 to 30 June 2025.\nIndependence\nWe are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the company and we remain independent of the company in conducting our audit.\nWe have provided no other non-audit services during the year ended 30 June 2025.\nUse of the audit report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nPankaj Rajani\n(Senior Statutory Auditor)\nFor and on behalf of Macalvins Limited, Statutory Auditor\nBank House\n7 St John's Road\nHarrow\nHA1 2EY\n7 November 2025\nSTATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nNotes\n2025\n\u00a3\n2024\n\u00a3\nAdministrative expenses\n(217,613)\n(355,921)\nOperating loss\n4\n(217,613)\n(355,921)\nFinance costs\n7\n-\n(1,409)\nLoss before taxation\n(217,613)\n(357,330)\nIncome tax expense\n8\n-\n-\nLoss for the year\n(217,613)\n(357,330)\nEarnings per share (Pence)\n9\nBasic\n(0.05)\n(0.09)\nDiluted\n(0.05)\n(0.09)\nEarnings per share from continuing operations\nBasic\n(0.05)\n(0.09)\nDiluted\n(0.05)\n(0.09)\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the year\n(217,613)\n(357,330)\nOther comprehensive income:\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income for the year\n(217,613)\n(357,330)\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 30 JUNE 2025\n2025\n2024\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n10\n608\n8,998\nCurrent tax recoverable\n-\n73,913\nCash and cash equivalents\n569,760\n561,054\n570,368\n643,965\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n17\n161,536\n242,020\nCurrent tax liabilities\n(179)\n75,321\nBorrowings\n12\n981,000\n681,000\n1,142,357\n998,341\nNet current (liabilities)/assets\n(571,989)\n(354,376)\nNet (liabilities)/assets\n(571,989)\n(354,376)\nEquity\nCalled up share capital\n19\n66,798\n66,798\nShare premium account\n20\n927,802\n927,802\nRetained earnings\n(1,566,589)\n(1,348,976)\nTotal equity\n(571,989)\n(354,376)\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issued on 7 November 2025 and are signed on its behalf by:\nL Filipovic\nDirector (Chairman & CEO)\nCompany registration number: 13310485\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nShare capital\nShare premium account\nRetained earnings\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nBalance at 1 July 2023\n66,798\n927,802\n(303,404)\n691,196\nYear ended 30 June 2023:\nLoss and total comprehensive income for the year\n(688,242)\n(688,242)\nBalance at 30 June 2023\n66,798\n927,802\n(991,646)\n2,954\nYear ended 30 June 2024:\nLoss and total comprehensive income for the year\n(357,330)\n(357,330)\nBalance at 30 June 2024\n66,798\n927,802\n(1,348,976)\n(354,376)\nBalance at 1 July 2025\n66,798\n927,802\n(1,348,976)\n(354,376)\nYear ended 30 June 2025\nLoss and total comprehensive income for the year\n(217,613)\n(217,613)\nBalance at 30 June 2025\n66,798\n927,802\n(1,566,589)\n(571,989)\nSTATEMENT OF CASHFLOWS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nCash flows from operating activities\nNotes\n2025\n\u00a3 \u00a3\n2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nCash absorbed by operations\n25\n(291,473)\n(303,187)\nIncome tax (paid) / refunded\n179\n-\nNet cash outflow from operating activities\n(291,294)\n(303,187)\nFinancing activities\nProceeds from loans from directors\n300,000\n500,000\nPayments of loans to directors\n-\n-\nAmount introduced by directors\n-\n1,325\nNet cash generated in financing activities\n300,000\n501,325\nNet increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n8,706\n198,138\nCash and cash equivalents atbeginning of year\n561,054\n362,916\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n569,760\n561,054\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n1. Accounting policies\nCompany information\nGS Chain Plc is a public company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is 71-75 Shelton St, London WC2H 9JQ. The Company's principal activities and nature of its operations are disclosed in the directors' report.\n1.1 Accounting convention\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the United Kingdom and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, except as otherwise stated.\nThe financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest \u00a3.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial instruments classified as financial instruments measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.\nThe Company has not traded or received income since incorporation and so no accounting policy in respect of revenue recognition is disclosed.\n1.2 Going concern\nThe directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future; details of which are included in Note 14. While the Company has negative net assets at 30 June 2025, the directors are confident that the existing financing will remain available to the Company and that additional sources of finance will be available. In the last two years audited accounts, the directors committed that the director loans whilst repayable on demand are not to be repaid until the Company is able to do so without impacting the Company's solvency and to, alternatively, convert the director loans into equity. Thus, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Having secured fresh working capital funding post balance sheet, the directors are confident that the short- and medium-term solvency of the company is sound. Directors' loans will not be called in to the detriment of the company.\n1.3 Cash and cash equivalents\nCash represents cash in hand and deposits held on demand with fintech specialised solutions. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less (as at their date of acquisition). Cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in that cash value.\nIn the presentation of the Statement of Cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts. Any such overdrafts are shown within borrowings under 'current liabilities' on the Statement of Financial Position.\n1.4 Financial assets\nFinancial assets are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are classified into specified categories, depending on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.\nFinancial assets held at cost\nFinancial instruments are classified as financial assets measured at cost where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at cost, less provision for impairment where necessary.\nImpairment of financial assets\nFinancial assets carried at cost are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.\nThe expected credit losses associated with these assets are estimated on a forward-looking basis. A broad range of information is considered when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nFinancial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n1.5 Financial liabilities\nThe company recognises financial debt when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial liabilities are classified as either 'financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss' or 'other financial liabilities'.\nOther financial liabilities\nOther financial liabilities, including borrowings, trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, are initially measured and subsequently held at fair value net of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of the financial liability. For the purposes of each financial liability, interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the company's obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.\n1.6 Equity instruments\nEquity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.\n1.7 Taxation\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n1.8 Employee benefits\nThe costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of inventories or non-current assets.\nThe cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.\nTermination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.\n1.9 Foreign exchange\nTransactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation in the period are included in profit or loss.\n1.10 Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year and excluding treasury shares.\nThe Company is loss making throughout the period considered in this Financial Information, therefore diluted earnings per share has not been considered.\n2 Adoption of new and revised standards and changes in accounting policies\nStandards which are in issue but not yet effective\nThe standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Financial Information are listed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.\nIAS 1 Amendments regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current - effective 1 January 2024\nIAS 1 Amendments regarding non-current liabilities with covenants - effective 1 January 2024\nIAS 21 Amendments regarding when a currency is exchangeable and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not - effective 1 January 2025\nIFRS 7 and IAS 7 Amendments regarding disclosure requirements for entities to provide qualitative and quantitative information about supplier finance\narrangements - effective 1 January 2024\nIFRS 16 Amendments regarding a sale and leaseback transaction - effective 1 January 2024\nThe Company is evaluating the impact of the new and amended standards above.\nThe Directors believe that these new and amended standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results or shareholders' funds.\n3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nIn the application of the Company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nThe estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are outlined below.\nCritical judgements\nGoing concern basis\nThe most significant judgement relates to the adoption of the going concern basis given the Company has not recorded any revenue since the date of incorporation.\nThe directors consider the Company's cash balances to be sufficient given the cash burn rate of the Company since listing on the London Stock Exchange to ensure the Company will be able to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the authorisation of these financial statements.\n4. Operating Loss\nOperating loss for the year is stated after charging:\n2025 2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nFees payable to the company's auditor for the audit of the\ncompany's financial statements (excluding VAT) 32,744 30,602\n5. Employees\nThe average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the company during the year was 3 (2024: 5).\nTheir aggregate remuneration comprised:\n2025 2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nWages and salaries - -\nSocial security costs - -\n6. Director's remuneration\n2025 2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nRemuneration for qualifying services - -\nRemuneration disclosed above includes the following amount paid respectively to the highest paid directors, of which there are four such individuals paid equally (further details included in the Directors' Remuneration report):\n2025 2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nRemuneration for qualifying services - -\nFrom 27 June 2023 the directors have agreed to defer payment of fees until such a time that a reverse takeover or acquisition is completed. The company has not paid any remuneration, as none was due, to any directors in the year ended 30 June 2025.\nDuring the year, two directors Alan Austen and Sanjay Nath have left the company, as disclosed in the Directors' Report.\n7. Finance costs\n2025 2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nOther interest payable 305 1,409\n8. Income tax expense\n2025 2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nCurrent tax\nAdjustments in respect of prior periods -\n73,913\nFactors affecting the tax expense\nThe charge for the year can be reconciled to the loss per the statement of profit or loss as follows:\n2025\n\u00a3\n2024\n\u00a3\nLoss before taxation\n(217,613)\n(357,330)\nExpected tax credit based on a corporation tax rate of 25% (2024:\n25%)\n(54,403)\n(95,333)\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets\n54,403\n95,333\nAdjustment in respect of prior years\n-\n73,913\nTaxation charge for the year\n-\n73,913\nAt the year end, there were cumulative unrecognised deferred tax assets of \u00a3388,781 (2024: \u00a3334,378) in respect of unutilised tax losses. These have not been recognised as a tax asset, as their recovery cannot be determined with reasonable certainty.\nDeferred tax assets in respect of carried forward losses are not recognised in the financial statements.\n9. Earnings per share\n2025 2024\nNumber Number\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings\nper share 399,985,888 399,985,888\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nEarnings\nContinuing operations\nLoss for the period from continued operations\n(217,613)\n(357,330)\n2025\n2024\nPence per share\nPence per share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\nFrom continuing operations\n(0.05)\n(0.09)\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nThe Board considers that during both the years ended 30 June 2025 and year ended 30 June 2024 the Company continued with its quest to analyse a list of potential acquisition targets throughout the period.\nThe Company's focus is on acquisitions in the technology space; specifically targeting companies that leverage state of the art technology in fintech, real estate, banking, finance, telecommunications, blockchain and AI sectors.\n10. Trade and other receivables\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoans to directors\n-\n-\nOther receivables\n608\n608\nPrepayments\n-\n8,390\n608\n8,998\nThe directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets held in the financial statements approximate to their fair values.\nLoans comprise solely of amounts loaned to directors. The loan is interest free and repayable on demand.\n11. Borrowings\n2025 2024\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nBorrowings held at cost:\nDirectors' loans 981,325 900,000\nLoans comprise solely of amounts introduced by directors which are for working capital requirements. The loan is interest free and repayable on demand. The loan will not be recalled until such a time that there is sufficient funds within the Company to enable repayment and for the business to remain a going concern.\n12. Fair value of financial liabilities\nThe directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial liabilities held in the financial statements approximate to their fair values.\n13. Liquidity risk\nThe following table details the remaining contractual maturity for the company's financial liabilities. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the company may be required to pay.\nLess than 1 year\n\u00a3\nAt 30 June 2024\nTrade payables excluding accrued expenses\n72,699\nDirectors' current account\n1,325\nDirectors' fees payable\n123,175\nDirectors' loans\n681,000\nCurrent tax liabilities\n75,321\n953,520\nAt 30 June 2025\nTrade payables excluding accrued expenses\n286\nDirectors' current account\n-\nDirectors' fees payable\n123,175\nDirectors' loans\n981,000\nCurrent tax liabilities\n(179)\n1,104,282\n14. Liquidity and capital risk management\nThe Company's capital structure consists of items in shareholders' equity (deficiency). The Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.\nThis was initially done through equity financing on incorporation however since then the Company has moved to achieving liquidity through loans from directors. Future financings are dependent on market conditions. There were no other changes to the Company's approach to capital management during the year.\nThe Company has adequate sources of capital to complete its business plan, current obligations and ultimately the development of its business over the long term and will need to raise adequate capital by obtaining equity financing and/or incurring debt.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. In conjunction with the Company's capital risk management policy, the Company ensures adequate liquidity is obtained and available to meet these obligations. At 30 June 2025, the Company had a cash balance of \u00a3569,760 to settle current liabilities of \u00a31,142,357. The Company has mitigated liquidity risk by securing \u00a3300,000 additional investment post year end, for working capital as announced on 16 October 2025. The director's loans, which stand at \u00a3981,000 at the year end, will not be called in as a current liability, if the company cannot meet the liability.\n15. Market risk\nMarket risk management\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company does not currently have any financial instruments that expose the Company to significant\ninterest rate risk as the Company does not have any debt that bears variable interest rates.\nCurrency risk\nThe Company's financial instruments are currently all denominated in British Pounds.\nPrice risk\nThe Company does not hold any equity securities and therefore is not exposed to price risk.\nCredit risk\nThe Company does not currently have any receivables and therefore is not exposed to credit risk.\n16. Business risk\nAs the Company is in its early stages, business risk mainly comprises effective cash management to ensure liabilities are met as they fall due.

It sets out the strategy, business model, key performance indicators, principal risks, and outlook for GS Chain Plc (the 'Company'), being a public limited company listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nBusiness Overview and Model\nGS Chain Plc was established as a listed investment vehicle focused on identifying and acquiring a target business or asset within the technology, digital, fintech, blockchain and AI sectors. The Company aims to generate long-term shareholder value by leveraging its listed status to acquire businesses with sustainable growth potential.\nThe Company's business model is designed around three core principles:\n- Identifying attractive acquisition opportunities in high-growth markets.- Applying rigorous, effective and targeted due diligence and financial discipline in target evaluation.- Creating post-acquisition value through value-add activities, active governance and strategic oversight.\n- After an acquisition is made. the role of the Board will be to empower and enable the senior management team of the acquired business, whilst monitoring and controlling progress and delivery.\nStrategy and Objectives\nThe primary objective of GS Chain Plc is to complete a qualifying acquisition that enhances shareholder value and establishes a sustainable operational platform. In the absence of an immediate acquisition, the Board continues to focus on maintaining financial discipline and compliance with Main Market obligations.\nKey strategic objectives include\n:\n- Identifying and assessing acquisition targets with strong management and scalable business models together with the execution ability and access to necessary resources to deliver the growth required- Preserving capital and maintaining an efficient cost structure while in the pre-acquisition phase.- Strengthening the Company's governance, reporting, and investor relations framework.- Ensuring compliance with all regulatory and market requirements applicable to a Main Market-listed company.\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nGiven the Company's pre-acquisition status, financial performance indicators remain limited.\nThe Board monitors key metrics\nincluding:\n- Cash balance and cash runway - to ensure sufficient resources for ongoing operations.\n- Administrative cost base - to maintain efficient stewardship of shareholder funds.\n- Share price performance and liquidity - as an indicator of market confidence.\n- Ability to raise funds effectively and in a timely manner for the cash resources of the company.\n- Progress towards identifying and engaging suitable acquisition targets.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Board recognises that as listed investment vehicle, the Company is exposed to certain inherent risks.\nThe\nprincipal risks and uncertainties\ninclude:\n- Acquisition Risk: Inability to identify or complete a suitable acquisition within a reasonable timeframe.- Market Risk: Volatility in equity markets impacting valuation and investor sentiment.- Regulatory and Compliance Risk: Evolving corporate governance and disclosure obligations under FCA and LSE rules.- Liquidity and Capital Management: Efficient utilisation of capital while maintaining operational flexibility.- Reputation Risk: The impact of deal execution or market perception on investor confidence.\nFinancial Review\nFor the year under review, the Company maintained a prudent approach to financial management. Administrative expenses were reduced from \u00a3352,537 in year end 30 June 2024 to \u00a3215,963 this year ended 30 June 2025, representing a reduction of 38% year on year.\nAccordingly, the Company reported a net loss of approximately \u00a3215,963 this year, down from \u00a3357,330 last year. This reflects the Board's desire to use the company's resources wisely and effectively before it successfully acquires a suitable business by RTO.\nCash and cash equivalents were more than sufficient to support ongoing acquisition search and corporate compliance activities. The company has also improved its fundraising agility as shown by the recent announcement of \u00a3300,000 of new investment as announced post year-end on 16 September 2025.\nIn the post-year end period, the Board will also continue to look at ways to reduce and pay down historical liabilities, whether that be for previous director payables, or director loans. The Board continues to monitor expenditure closely for necessity and impact, and more effectively secure more funding options to support intended and purposeful acquisition activity.\nThere are more details of the Financial Review in the section entitled Financial Review provided by the COO, Sebastien Guerin, starting on page 6\n.\nESG and Corporate Responsibility\nWhile the Company is currently in the pre-acquisition phase, the Board is still committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical conduct. Future acquisitions will be assessed not only on financial merit but also on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credentials. The Company supports responsible, ethical and sustainable investment principles consistent with long-term value creation.\nThe are more\nESG\ndetails available in the CEO's Statement on page 4.\nOutlook\nThe near-term focus of the remains on not only identifying and executing a suitable acquisition, but improving our execution ability in this respect, and aligning agile funding strategies to support a suitable acquisition in due course. The Board continues to engage with capable and proven advisors and potential counterparties within the technology, fintech, digital innovation, blockchain and related AI sectors. Despite prevailing economic uncertainty, the directors are confident that the Company's listed structure and disciplined approach will position it well to deliver value to shareholders over the medium term.\nApproval\nThis Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 31 October 2025 and signed on its behalf by:\n__________________________\nLeon FilipovicChief Executive OfficerGS Chain PLC\nCEO's STATEMENT\nBusiness strategy and objective\nThe Company remains focused on identifying and acquiring businesses within the technology sector, particularly those utilising advanced technologies in fintech, banking, finance, and blockchain. Through ongoing due diligence and disciplined execution, we continue to seek acquisition targets that align with our growth strategy, ensuring both short-term impact and long-term sustainability.\nWhile the Board of Directors draws from a diverse range of industry expertise, our efforts have been concentrated on technology-driven sectors. The Board remains open to considering other industries if they offer strong potential for value creation and complement the Company's objectives. The Company has made some changes to the Board of Directors in the interest of efficiency and in preparation for the addition of new Board members as we further develop and intensify our acquisition efforts. These are detailed in the Board of Directors section.\nBuilding on the foundations established since our listing, GS Chain Plc is dedicated to creating enduring shareholder value by acquiring high-quality companies with strong growth potential. The experience and industry knowledge of the Board and its advisors as both evolve, will continue to guide us in capitalizing on strategic opportunities for sustained success.\nReview of activities for the year ended 30 June 2025\nThe Board of Directors continues to actively evaluate potential acquisition targets that align with the Company's strategic focus. While no acquisition costs were incurred during the year ended 30 June 2025, the Company remains committed to pursuing appropriate opportunities that will enhance long-term shareholder value. We are reviewing and looking to further improve our thorough assessment process ensuring that only those companies with significant potential for growth and alignment with our technological focus are considered for acquisition.\nPost Year-End Activities:\nAs announced on the 3 September 2025, the Company confirmed that further to recent changes to the UK Listing Rules (UKLR), GS Chain PLC notes that the transitional provisions under UKLR 13 expired on 29 July 2025. UKLR 13 requires a listed shell company to complete an initial acquisition transaction within 24 months from 30 July 2025, extendable by shareholder approval. To give effect to these provisions, companies are required to amend their constitutions to include the relevant timeframes. This aligns with the Company's strategic goal to complete an acquisition in advance of the 29 July 2027 date.\nThis allows the Company adequate time for GS Chain Plc's ongoing strategy, operational effectiveness, and future prospects. The Company's shares continue to trade on the London Main Market, our focus remains on identifying and executing acquisitions within the technology sector, specifically targeting fintech, banking, finance, and blockchain industries including AI additions.\nAs announced on 16 September 2025, GS Chain PLC has entered into a Convertible Investment Agreement with a family office, Citymeade Limited, securing an initial investment of \u00a3300,000 mainly to support working capital. The company is delighted to secure this investment, as the first stage of a series of significant new investments that the company plans to raise in 2025-2026. The company welcomes Citymeade to the GS Chain family.\nTransparency and open communication remain a top priority, and we will continue to update our stakeholders on any further developments through the required channels.\nBoard of Directors\nGS Chain Plc has changed the composition of the Board during the year to reflect the evolving needs of the Company. The Board now continues to provide strong governance and direction, leveraging its collective expertise to drive the Company's growth and long-term objectives.\nFurthermore, the company is looking to enhance its Board's effectiveness going forward and will look to make suitable additions or changes as the company continues to evolve into the 2025-2026 financial year.\nLeon Filipovic\nChief Executive Officer\nDate: 31 October 2025\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nLoss for the year\nFor the year the Company recorded a loss of \u00a3 215,963 (2024: \u00a3357,330 loss).

Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Chief Operating Officer prepares and presents a cashflow, expenditure and balance sheet projection for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements which is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Directors take into account this information and all other available factors for the foreseeable future, in particular for the twelve months from the date of approval of the financial information.\nThe Company has cash reserves of \u00a3569,794 as of 30 June 2025. Post year-end, the company has secured fresh investment of \u00a3300,000 from a family office Citymeade Limited, primarily to augment working capital as announced on 16 September 2025. This is the first in a series of targeted new investments that the company plans to raise.\nEnergy and carbon reporting\nThe Company recognises it has a responsibility to the environment and endeavours to be as environmentally friendly as possible in its business activities. As the Company has consumed less than 40 MWh of energy in the UK, the low energy exemption has been applied. In assessing whether the threshold was met, the Company has considered all energy from gas, electricity, and transport usage as required by the UK Government's Guidance on Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting.\nStatement of Director's responsibilities\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Report of the Directors and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\u25cf\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n\u25cf\nmake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n\u25cf\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nStatement as to Disclosure of Information to Auditors\nSo far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company's auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\nAuditors\nThe auditors, Macalvins Limited, have expressed their willingness to continue in office and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\nThe maintenance and integrity of the GS Chain Plc website is the responsibility of the Directors.\nThe CEO's statement and Financial Review, all of which are incorporated into this report, include a true and fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategies.\nThe financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the issuer.\nOn behalf of the board\nLeon Filipovic\nDirector (Chairman & CEO).\nDate: 31 October 2025\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\nIntroduction\nThe Board is committed to good corporate governance and because it is a Company listed on the Standard Segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority, the Company is required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

The Board requires Directors to declare all appointments and other situations which could result in a possible conflict of interest.\nBoard performance and evaluation\nGS Chain Plc has a policy of appraising Board performance annually. GS Chain Plc has re-affirmed that for a company of its current scale, an internal process administered by the Board is most appropriate at this stage.\nCompany culture\nCompany culture is discussed and monitored at Board level.

Once this has been achieved, the Board will implement a strategy to achieve the required targets on gender and ethnicity. Having said that, the company will look to add additional Board members in the 2025-2026 financial year, and will look to broaden its diversity, subject to the above.\nAs the Company only has 3 employees, which solely comprise the Board of directors, no data collection methodology has been required.\nAccountability\nThe Board is committed to providing shareholders with a clear assessment of the Company's position and prospects. This is achieved through this report and as required other periodic financial and trading statements.

The committee oversees the Company's financial reporting and internal controls and provides a formal reporting link with the external auditors. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and the half-yearly reports remains with the Board. The Audit Committee meets not less than twice in each financial year and will have unrestricted access to the Company's external auditors. The Audit Committee is chaired by Mark Wilson, and its other member is Leon Filipovic.\nMain responsibilities\nThe Audit Committee acts as a preparatory body for discharging the Board's responsibilities in a wide range of financial matters by:\n\u25cf\nMonitoring the integrity of the financial statements and formal announcements relating to the Company's financial performance;\n\u25cf\nReviewing significant financial reporting issues and accounting policies and disclosures in financial reports;\n\u25cf\nOverseeing that an effective system of internal control and risk management systems are maintained through review of these at periodic meetings of the Committee, implementing actions arising from these meetings where necessary;\n\u25cf\nEnsuring that effective whistleblowing, anti-fraud and bribery procedures are in place;\n\u25cf\nConsidering the Company's internal audit requirements and making recommendations to the Board;\n\u25cf\nOverseeing the Board's relationship with the external auditors and, where appropriate, the selection of new external auditors;\n\u25cf\nApproving non-audit services provided by the external auditors, or any other accounting firm, ensuring the independence and objectivity of the external auditors is safeguarded when appointing them to conduct non-audit services;\n\u25cf\nEnsuring compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nThe Company's external auditors are Macalvins Limited, and the Audit Committee will closely monitor the level of audit and non-audit services they provide to the Company. In the year ended 30 June 2025 Macalvins Limited performed no non-audit services for the Company.\nInternal audit function\nAs the Company is in its initial stages, and has not yet acquired any subsidiaries, and has no employees beyond the Board of Directors, the necessity of an internal audit function is not considered appropriate. The Board will review this stance and implement accordingly when necessary.\nExternal auditor\nThe Company's external auditors are Macalvins Limited. The external auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee Chairman. The Committee is satisfied that Macalvins Limited has adequate policies and safeguards in place to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence are maintained.

Having assessed the performance objectively and independence of the Auditors, the Committee will be considering the reappointment of Macalvins Limited as auditors to the Company at the next annual general meeting.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT\nWe have audited the financial statements of GS Chain Plc for the year ended 30 June 2025 which comprise the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, the statement of financial position, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nIn our opinion:\n\u25cf\nthe financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 30 June 2025 and of the company's loss for the year then ended;\n\u25cf\nthe financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the IASB; and\n\u25cf\nthe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey audit matter\nAudit response to key matter\nFindings\nFraud in revenue recognition\nPresumed risk under ISA 240:\nIncorrect treatment of income under IFRS.\nWe performed relevant audit procedures and specific tests to evaluate if income had been omitted from the financial statements for the current year. Our procedures included the following:\n-\nReview of Company Bank Statements\n:\n- Our review of the company's bank statements did not reveal evidence of income which had been omitted and not accurately reflected in the financial statements.\n-\nExamination of Board Minutes:\n- Inspection of all board minutes did not yield any evidence of contracts that were agreed upon or acquisitions that were completed but not recorded in the financial statements, indicating that income recognition is accurate.\n-\nReview of RNS Filings:\n- The review of all RNS filings made since June 30, 2024, did not provide evidence that the company had completed any unrecorded acquisitions or revenue-generating agreements that would affect income recognition in the financial statements.\nThese procedures enabled to us to form an opinion that the presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition is rebuttable under ISA 240.\nManagement override of controls\nPresumed risk under ISA 240:\nRisk of management using their position in the company to manipulate financial results and misappropriate assets.\nIn addition to the procedures described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\" of the Audit report, we audited to higher risk all areas requiring judgement, performed tests on a sample basis of journal entries exhibiting unusual characteristics, journals relating to areas of significant audit interest and incorporated unpredictability in our substantive testing procedures.\nWe assessed the appropriateness of liabilities and transactions to related parties, reviewing management's review of contracts, their identification and estimation of performance obligations, including ratification of such obligations by the board and reviewing appropriate supporting documentation.\nBased on our audit procedures performed we have not identified any instances of management override of controls.\nGoing concern\nRisk of incorrect use of the going concern assumption based on the company's financial position arising from obligations to repay working capital loans and remuneration to the Directors, other operating losses and cash position as at 30 June 2025.\nWe performed procedures to test and assess the significant assumptions used in the working capital forecasts, including performing sensitivity analysis as detailed in the going concern section of the audit report.\nBased on the result of our audit procedures and verification of the post balance sheet event, we have noted our assessment of going concern below in our audit report.\nCash management\nRisk of misappropriation or inappropriate management of cash.\nWe reviewed external 3rd party confirmations to gain comfort over the cash balances held and identify any undisclosed liabilities and reviewed the internal risk assessment to ensure that risks associated with holding large cash balance have been completely addressed.\nBased on the results of our audit procedures the cash balances were not materially misstated. Given the size of the company, and the number of directors, the current cash controls, although not formally documented are appropriate. We have made a recommendation to consider enhancing formal documentation around cash controls as the company grows.\nKey audit matter\nAudit response to key matter\nFindings\nAccounting disclosures\nRisk that IFRS and UK Corporate Governance Code are not compliant or omitted.\nWe thoroughly reviewed the accounts' disclosures to ensure that all required information was included utilising appropriate industry standard IFRS disclosure checklist and the UK corporate governance code checklist. The latter encompassed compliance with Listing rules, Disclosure and Transparency Rules pertaining to audit committees and corporate governance statements, the 2018 version of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC, FRC Guidance on Risk Management/Internal Controls, the 2016 FRC guidance on Audit Committees, the 2018 FRC guidance on Board Effectiveness, and the FRC Minimum Standards for 2023 concerning Audit Committees and external audit.\nFurthermore, we conducted a review of the LSE listing for company to identify any essential information requiring disclosure.\nAll disclosure adjustments or omissions assessed as material have been corrected by management.\nWe have concluded the financial statements are materially compliant with IFRS, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Listing Rules and other relevant regulation.\nUnderstatement of expenses and liabilities\nRisk that expenses are understated, an incentive to understatement was identified during our risk assessment due to the company's losses and net liability position.\nThe following audit procedures were performed and included, among others:\n- Audited a sample of operating expenses and supporting documentation, vouching for the accuracy and classification of the expenses.\n- Performed analytical reviews of expenses with the prior year and obtaining explanations in respect of unexpected movements.\n- Performed substantive audit procedures on creditors and accruals and reviewed post year end bank statements/board minutes and publicly available records for evidence of omitted expenditure/undisclosed liabilities.\n- We make enquiries of known service providers to ensure that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements were not omitted or understated.\nWe have furthermore obtained confirmation from relevant individuals and entities confirming the company's aggregate transactions with then during the period under audit and the company obligations at the year end.\nAdjustments were identified in respect of cost incorrectly recorded as expenses which should have been included within the directors' current account.\nThese have been corrected by management and therefore based results of our audit procedures the expenses balances are not materially misstated.\nKey audit matter\nAudit response to key matter\nFindings\nUndisclosed related parties\nRisk that transactions with related parties have not correctly disclosed or accounted for.\nThe following audit procedures were performed and included, among others:\n- Reviewed directors service agreements.\n- Reviewed the company board minutes.\n- Reviewed the financial statements to ensure related party transactions are disclosed in accordance with IAS 24 Related Parties.\n- Obtained confirmations from the directors in respect of amounts due and owed to the company.\nReviewed post year statements, minutes and other available data to assess whether any related.\nWe identified adjustments in respect of directors' fee accruals and expenses taken to the income statement which required allocation to the directors' accounts.\nManagement have corrected all material adjustments and items in respect of disclosures.\nBased results of our audit procedures the expenses balances are not materially misstated and compliant with IAS24.\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of time and efforts of the engagement team and directing the audit procedures undertaken. The identification and adjustment of the expenditure referred to in the key audit matters above were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters and did not change our assessment of key audit matters during the performance of the audit.\nOverall materiality\n\u00a310,500\nBenchmark applied\n5% of total loss for the year\n\u00a3215,963\nRationale for benchmark\nThe company is still at an early stage of development.\nThe main activity of the company since incorporation has been identifying an acquisition target and incurring costs in respect of public company listings.\nThe loss for the year which is due to administrative expenses has been determined to be the most appropriate basis for materiality.\nPerformance materiality\nPerformance materiality is set to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements in the financial statements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nWe set performance materiality at \u00a37,350, which represents 70% of overall materiality\nTriviality threshold\nWe agreed with the directors that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above\n\u00a3525\nas well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to the disclosures made in Note 1.2, 3 and 14 to the financial statements concerning the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The company's going concern assessment is dependent on the successful completion of further capital raise and a planned reverse takeover (RTO), expected in February and July 2026 respectively. As of the date of this report, these fundraising activities have not been formalised. Should these events not occur as intended, the company will have utilised its cash reserves by July 2026. These conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\u25cf\nConfirm our understanding of the directors' going concern assessment process, including the controls over the review and approval of the budget and plan. We have obtained a copy of management's assessment of going concern and evidence that the assessment\nwas approved by the Board;\n\u25cf\nAssessing the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern assessment period to 31 October 2026 and considering the existence of any significant events or conditions beyond this period based on our procedures on the company's plans and knowledge arising from other areas of the audit;\n\u25cf\nReview and verification of the inputs and assumptions used in the board approved working capital forecasts, identifying the key assumptions and evaluating the appropriateness of these assumptions;\n\u25cf\nEvaluating management's historical forecasting accuracy and the consistency of the going concern assessment with information obtained from other areas of the audit, such as our audit procedures on the company's plans;\n\u25cf\nTesting the mechanical accuracy of the going concern analysis;\n\u25cf\nConfirming the existence and availability of financing for the company's operations;\n\u25cf\nPerforming independent sensitivity analysis on management's assumptions including applying adverse cashflow sensitivities and evaluating the appropriateness of mitigating actions available to management for example deferring expenditure; and\n\u25cf\nEvaluating the disclosures on going concern.\nOur observations\nThe Company is planning to complete an acquisition via reverse takeover (RTO) within the next 12 months. However, as of the date of the financial statements, the Company has not entered into an agreement to acquire a company, but it does now have a fresh funding agreement as announced on 16 September 2025, and furthermore, has a series of further investment fundraisers planned. There remains a possibility that the acquisition may not occur. The directors intend to secure additional investment in the event the RTO is successful. The company has raised \u00a3300,000 of additional working capital post year end, to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to remain solvent and provide a comfortable level of cash headroom. The company also expects to raise further working capital in February and July 2026; should these not materialise, the current cash reserves will be depleted by July 2026.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have identified material uncertainties relating to events or conditions noted above that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events such as the RTO can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the company's ability to continue as a going concern after any significant events including but not limited to the acquisition.\nOther information\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion of the directors' remuneration disclosure within the directors' remuneration report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u25cf\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u25cf\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u25cf\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u25cf\nthe company financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u25cf\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u25cf\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nCorporate governance statement\nOur obligation is to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern and viability of the company and review the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified in The Listing Rules.\nWe have concluded, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\u25cf\nDirectors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified in their statement;\n\u25cf\nDirectors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out in their statement;\n\u25cf\nDirector's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out in their statement;\n\u25cf\nDirectors' statement on accountability, diversity and other matters set out in their statement;\n\u25cf\nBoard's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out in their statement;\n\u25cf\nThe section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out in their statement; and;\n\u25cf\nThe section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee set out in their statement.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 6, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\u25cf\nthe nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the company's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n\u25cf\nresults of our enquiries of management about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities;\n\u25cf\nidentifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of noncompliance;\n\u25cf\ndetecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n\u25cf\nthe internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf\nAddressing the risks of fraud through management override of controls by performing journal entry testing.\nThese matters were discussed among the audit engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\nAs a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the company operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act and local tax legislation\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with management. As with any audit, there remains a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal controls.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nOther matters which we are required to address\nWe were reappointed by the directors on 21 October 2025 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2025. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is 4 years, covering the period ending 30 June 2022 to 30 June 2025.\nIndependence\nWe are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the company and we remain independent of the company in conducting our audit.\nWe have provided no other non-audit services during the year ended 30 June 2025.\nUse of the audit report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.

The registered office is 71-75 Shelton St, London WC2H 9JQ. The Company's principal activities and nature of its operations are disclosed in the directors' report.\n1.1 Accounting convention\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the United Kingdom and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, except as otherwise stated.\nThe financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest \u00a3.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial instruments classified as financial instruments measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.\nThe Company has not traded or received income since incorporation and so no accounting policy in respect of revenue recognition is disclosed.\n1.2 Going concern\nThe directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future; details of which are included in Note 14. While the Company has negative net assets at 30 June 2025, the directors are confident that the existing financing will remain available to the Company and that additional sources of finance will be available.\nIn the last two years audited accounts, the directors committed that the director loans whilst repayable on demand are not to be repaid until the Company is able to do so without impacting the Company's solvency and to, alternatively, convert the director loans into equity. Thus, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Having secured fresh working capital funding post balance sheet, the directors are confident that the short- and medium-term solvency of the company is sound. Directors' loans will not be called in to the detriment of the company.\n1.3 Cash and cash equivalents\nCash represents cash in hand and deposits held on demand with fintech specialised solutions. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less (as at their date of acquisition). Cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in that cash value.\nIn the presentation of the Statement of Cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts. Any such overdrafts are shown within borrowings under 'current liabilities' on the Statement of Financial Position.\n1.4 Financial assets\nFinancial assets are recognised in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are classified into specified categories, depending on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.\nFinancial assets held at cost\nFinancial instruments are classified as financial assets measured at cost where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at cost, less provision for impairment where necessary.\nImpairment of financial assets\nFinancial assets carried at cost are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.\nThe expected credit losses associated with these assets are estimated on a forward-looking basis. A broad range of information is considered when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nFinancial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n1.5 Financial liabilities\nThe company recognises financial debt when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial liabilities are classified as either 'financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss' or 'other financial liabilities'.\nOther financial liabilities\nOther financial liabilities, including borrowings, trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, are initially measured and subsequently held at fair value net of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of the financial liability. For the purposes of each financial liability, interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the company's obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.\n1.6 Equity instruments\nEquity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the company.\n1.7 Taxation\nThe tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n1.8 Employee benefits\nThe costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as part of the cost of inventories or non-current assets.\nThe cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.\nTermination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.\n1.9 Foreign exchange\nTransactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation in the period are included in profit or loss.\n1.10 Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year and excluding treasury shares.\nThe Company is loss making throughout the period considered in this Financial Information, therefore diluted earnings per share has not been considered.\n2. Adoption of new and revised standards and changes in accounting policies\nStandards which are in issue but not yet effective\nThe standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Financial Information are listed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.\nIAS 1\nAmendments regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current - effective 1 January 2024\nIAS 1\nAmendments regarding non-current liabilities with covenants - effective 1 January 2024\nIAS 21\nAmendments regarding when a currency is exchangeable and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not - effective 1 January 2025\nIFRS 7 and IAS 7\nAmendments regarding disclosure requirements for entities to provide qualitative and quantitative information about supplier finance arrangements - effective 1 January 2024\nIFRS 16\nAmendments regarding a sale and leaseback transaction - effective 1 January 2024\nThe Company is evaluating the impact of the new and amended standards above.\nThe Directors believe that these new and amended standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results or shareholders' funds.\n3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nIn the application of the Company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nThe estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are outlined below.\nCritical judgements\nGoing concern basis\nThe most significant judgement relates to the adoption of the going concern basis given the Company has not recorded any revenue since the date of incorporation.\nThe directors consider the Company's cash balances to be sufficient given the cash burn rate of the Company since listing on the London Stock Exchange to ensure the Company will be able to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the authorisation of these financial statements.\n4 Operating loss\nOperating loss for the year is stated after charging:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nFees payable to the company's auditor for the audit of the company's financial statements\n36,750\n30,602\n5 Employees\nThe average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the company during the year was\n3\n(2024: 5).\nTheir aggregate remuneration comprised:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nWages and salaries\n-\n24,000\nSocial security costs\n-\n-\n-\n24,000\n6 Directors' remuneration\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRemuneration for qualifying services\n-\n24,000\nRemuneration disclosed above includes the following amount paid respectively to the highest paid directors, of which there are four such individuals paid equally (further details included in the Directors' Remuneration report):\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRemuneration for qualifying services\n-\n24,000\nFrom 27 June 2023 the directors have agreed to defer payment of fees until such a time that a reverse takeover or acquisition is completed. The company has not paid any remuneration, as none was due, to any directors in the year ended 30 June 2025.\nDuring the year, two directors Alan Austen and Sanjay Nath have left the company, as disclosed in the Directors' Report.\n7 Finance costs\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nOther interest payable\n-\n1,409\n8 Income tax expense\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCurrent tax\nAdjustments in respect of prior periods\n-\n73,913\nFactors affecting the tax expense\nThe charge for the year can be reconciled to the loss per the statement of profit or loss as follows:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss before taxation\n(215,963)\n(357,330)\nExpected tax credit based on a corporation tax rate of 25% (2024: 25%)\n(53,991)\n(95,333)\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets\n53,991\n95,333\nAdjustment in respect of prior years\n-\n73,913\nTaxation charge for the year\n-\n73,913\nAt the year end, there were cumulative unrecognised deferred tax assets of \u00a3388,369 (2024: \u00a3334,378) in respect of unutilised tax losses. These have not been recognised as a tax asset, as their recovery cannot be determined with reasonable certainty.\nDeferred tax assets in respect of carried forward losses are not recognised in the financial statements.\n9 Earnings per share\n2025\n2024\nNumber\nNumber\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share\n399,985,888\n399,985,888\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nEarnings\nContinuing operations\nLoss for the period from continued operations\n(215,963)\n(357,330)\n2025\n2024\nPence per share\nPence per share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\nFrom continuing operations\n(0.05)\n(0.09)\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nThe Board considers that during both the years ended 30 June 2025 and year ended 30 June 2024 the Company continued with its quest to analyse a list of potential acquisition targets throughout the period.\nThe Company's focus is on acquisitions in the technology space; specifically targeting companies that leverage state of the art technology in fintech, real estate, banking, finance, telecommunications, blockchain and AI sectors.\n10 Trade and other receivables\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoans to directors\n-\n-\nOther receivables\n608\n608\nPrepayments\n-\n8,390\n608\n8,998\nThe directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets held in the financial statements approximate to their fair values.\nLoans comprise solely of amounts loaned to directors. The loan is interest free and repayable on demand.\n11 Borrowings\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nBorrowings held at cost:\nDirectors' loans\n982,325\n900,000\nLoans comprise solely of amounts introduced by directors which are for working capital requirements. The loan is interest free and repayable on demand. The loan will not be recalled until such a time that there is sufficient funds within the Company to enable repayment and for the business to remain a going concern.\n12 Fair value of financial liabilities\nThe directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial liabilities held in the financial statements approximate to their fair values\n13 Liquidity risk\nThe following table details the remaining contractual maturity for the company's financial liabilities. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the company may be required to pay.\nLess than 1 year\n\u00a3\nAt 30 June 2024\nTrade payables excluding accrued expenses\n72,699\nDirectors' current account\n1,325\nDirectors' fees payable\n123,175\nDirectors' loans\n681,000\nCurrent tax liabilities\n75,321\n953,520\nAt 30 June 2025\nTrade payables excluding accrued expenses\n(1,669)\nDirectors' current account\n-\nDirectors' fees payable\n123,175\nDirectors' loans\n982,325\nCurrent tax liabilities\n-\n1,140,402\n14 Liquidity and capital risk management\nThe Company's capital structure consists of items in shareholders' equity (deficiency). The Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.\nThis was initially done through equity financing on incorporation however since then the Company has moved to achieving liquidity through loans from directors. Future financings are dependent on market conditions. There were no other changes to the Company's approach to capital management during the year.\nThe Company has adequate sources of capital to complete its business plan, current obligations and ultimately the development of its business over the long term and will need to raise adequate capital by obtaining equity financing and/or incurring debt.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. In conjunction with the Company's capital risk management policy, the Company ensures adequate liquidity is obtained and available to meet these obligations. At 30 June 2025, the Company had a cash balance of \u00a3569,794 to settle current liabilities of \u00a31,140.402. The Company has mitigated liquidity risk by securing \u00a3300,000 additional investment post year end, for working capital as announced on 16 October 2025. The director's loans, which stand at \u00a3982,325 at the year end, will not be called in as a current liability, if the company cannot meet the liability.\n15 Market risk\nMarket risk management\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company does not currently have any financial instruments that expose the Company to significant interest rate risk as the Company does not have any debt that bears variable interest rates.\nCurrency risk\nThe Company's financial instruments are currently all denominated in British Pounds.\nPrice risk\nThe Company does not hold any equity securities and therefore is not exposed to price risk.\nCredit risk\nThe Company does not currently have any receivables and therefore is not exposed to credit risk.\n16 Business risk\nAs the Company is in its early stages, business risk mainly comprises effective cash management to ensure liabilities are met as they fall due. The Board mitigates the impact of this by periodically reviewing cash levels against forecasts and implements strategies and actions to ensure sufficient cash is available for the operation to continue as a going concern in order to meet the Company's objectives.\n17 Trade and other payables\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nTrade payables\n(1,848)\n72,699\nAccruals\n36,750\n44,821\nDirectors current account\n-\n1,325\nAccrued directors' fees\n123,175\n123,175\n158,077\n242,020\n18 Share-based payment transactions\nThere have been no share-based payment schemes or share option compensation since the Company was incorporated.\n19 Share capital\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNumber\nNumber\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nOrdinary share capital\nIssued and fully paid\nOrdinary of 0.0167p each\n399,985,888\n399,985,888\n66,798\n66,798\nAll Ordinary shares are allotted and fully paid.\n20 Share premium account\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAt the beginning and end of the year\n927,802\n927,802\n21 Contingent liabilities\nAt 30 June 2025 the Company had no material contingent liabilities to report.\n22 Events after the reporting date\nAs announced on the 16 October 2025, the company secured a fresh investment into working capital of \u00a3300,000 from Citymeade Limited, using a convertible investment note.\n23 Related party transactions\nRemuneration of key management personnel\nThe remuneration of key management personnel comprises solely of the directors. This information is summarised in the note entitled Directors' remuneration with further detail included in the Directors' Remuneration Report.\nOther transactions with related parties\nTransactions with related parties include directors' fees and loans which are disclosed in the following notes:\n\u25cf\nDirectors' remuneration\n- fees paid to directors in the year\n\u25cf\nTrade and other receivables\n- loans made by the Company to directors\n\u25cf\nTrade and other payables\n- cumulative accrued directors fees due to directors at the reporting date\n\u25cf\nBorrowings\n- loans made by directors to the Company\nOf the above, directors' remuneration and accrued directors' fees are arm's length transactions and conducted under normal commercial terms. The directors' loans receivable and payable have no right of offset and are not at arm's length or conducted under normal commercial terms; details of the terms of these loans are disclosed in Notes 11 and 12.\n24 Controlling party\nThere is no one shareholder that owns greater than 50% of the issued share capital of GS Chain Plc. The Company therefore does not have an ultimate controlling party.\n25 Cash absorbed by operations\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the year before income tax\n(215,963)\n(357,330)\nAdjustments for:\nFinance costs\n-\n1,409\nMovements in working capital:\nIncrease in trade and other receivables\n1,325\n(9,000)\nIncrease/(decrease) in trade and other payables\n141,019\n85,734\nCash absorbed by operations\n(73,619)\n(303,187)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
