Sectors of particular focus include business services and technology.\nThe Company is the parent company of Red Capital Subco Limited (a private limited company under the laws of Jersey with registered number 134741) and together will be referred to as the\n\"\nGroup\n\"\nin these accounts.\nResults and developments in the six month period to 30 June 2025\nThe Group's loss after taxation was \u00a399,548 (six month period to 30 June 2024: loss of \u00a3110,517). This principally reflected operating expenses incurred as a listed business of \u00a399,802 (six month period to 30 June 2024: \u00a3111,803).\nThe Group generated a loss per share of \u00a30.01 (six month period to 30 June 2024: loss per share of \u00a30.01).\nAs a result of tight cost control and moderate operating expenses, as at 30 June 2025, Red's cash balance was \u00a340,765 (31 December 2024: \u00a3160,427).\nOn\n18 June\n2025, the Company held its Annual General Meeting in which all resolutions were unanimously passed.\nRisks\nAs the Company has yet to complete an investment or acquisition, it has limited financial statements and / or historical financial data, and limited trading history. As such, the Group and Company during the period were subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with an early-stage acquisition company.\nThe Directors are of the opinion that these risks, which were detailed further in Red's published final results for the financial year ended 31 December 2024, remain applicable to the Group and Company.\nDividend\nAt this point in the Company's development, it does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\u00a0Following the Company's inaugural investment or acquisition, the Directors will determine an appropriate dividend policy for Red.\nOutlook\nDuring the period, and post period end, Red has continued to pursue its investment and acquisition strategy and is currently assessing opportunities within its chosen sectors of interest. These include successful businesses with the potential for high growth that are seeking to partner with, and leverage the benefits of, the Board's experience and that of the wider Red team. The Directors look forward to updating shareholders in due course.\nStatement of Directors' responsibilities\nThe Directors confirm that these condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 and DTR 4.2.8, namely:\n\u00b7\nan indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n\u00b7\nmaterial related-party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related-party transactions described in the last annual report.\nBy order of the Board\nDavid Williams\nChairman\n28 September 2025\nEnquiries\n:\nTessera Investment Management Limited\nTony Morris\n+44 (0) 7742 189145\nINTERIM\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025\nNote\nSix months ended\n30 June 2025\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nSix months ended\n30 June 2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nAdministrative expenses\n(99,802)\n(111,803)\nOperating loss\n(99,802)\n(111,803)\nInterest receivable\n5\n254\n1,286\nLoss on ordinary activities before taxation\n(99,548)\n(110,517)\nTaxation charge\n-\n-\nLoss and total comprehensive loss for the period\n(99,548)\n(110,517)\nLoss per share\nBasic & diluted\n10\n(\u00a30.01)\n(\u00a30.01)\nLoss attributable to:\nOwners of the parent company\n(99,548)\n(110,517)\nThe Group has no items of other comprehensive income in either the current or prior period.

The Company is the parent company of Red Capital Subco Limited (a private limited company under the laws of Jersey with registered number 134741), and together form the \"Group\".\nThe address of its registered office is 28 Esplanade, St. Helier, Channel Islands, JE2 3QA, Jersey.\nThe Group has been incorporated for the purpose of identifying suitable acquisition opportunities in accordance with the Group's investment and acquisition strategy with a view to creating shareholder value. The Group will retain a flexible investment and acquisition strategy which will, subject to appropriate levels of due diligence, enable it to deploy capital in target companies by way of minority or majority investments, or full acquisitions where it is in the interests of shareholders to do so. This will include transactions with target companies located in the UK and internationally.\n2.\nBasis of preparation\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have neither been audited nor reviewed by the Company's auditor.\nThe unaudited interim financial statements in this report have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the UK. The accounting policies adopted in the interim financial statements are consistent with those adopted in the Group's last annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024 with regards to the measurement and recognition of each type of asset, liability, income and expense presented. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual report as at 31 December 2024, which is available on the Company's website.\nThese interim financial statements present selected explanatory notes to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since 31 December 2024.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in \u00a3 and rounded to the nearest \u00a3 unless otherwise stated.\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 September 2025.\nComparative figures\nComparative figures which have been presented cover the six month period ended 30 June 2024. The statement of financial position comparative figures are shown as at 31 December 2024.\nStatutory accounts\nFinancial information contained in this document does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those statutory accounts was unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of the opinion that the Group and Company have adequate working capital to execute their operations over the next 12 months (\"the going concern period\"). The Group and Company's unaudited cash balance as at 18 September 2025 was \u00a3207. Excluding the consummation of any investment or acquisition which will likely require specific funding, the Group and Company have adequate resources available to it to fund the on-going forecast operating expenses during the going concern period as a result of an undertaking of the provision of financial support provided by the Directors to the Group, and by other shareholders of the Company. The Directors, therefore, have made an informed judgement at the time of approving the interim condensed consolidated financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.\n3.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the following policies which have been consistently applied:\nBasis of consolidation\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.\nWhere the Group has control over a Company, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Group controls a company if all three of the following elements are present: power over the Company, exposure to variable returns from the Company, and the ability of the Group to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the interim consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The acquisition related costs are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on an accruals basis. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.\nFunctional and presentational currency\nThe Group's functional and presentational currency for these financial statements is the pound sterling.\nInterest receivable\nInterest receivable is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\nTaxation\nTax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less from inception, held for meeting short term commitments.\nFinancial assets and liabilities\nThe Group's financial assets and liabilities comprise of cash and cash equivalents, other receivables and accruals. Financial assets are stated at amortised cost less provision for expected credit losses. Financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost.\nEquity\nEquity comprises of share capital, share premium, capital redemption reserve, share based payment reserve, and retained deficit.\nShare capital is measured at the par value.\nShare premium and retained deficit represent balances conventionally attributed to those descriptions. The transaction costs relating to the issue of shares was deducted from share premium.\nThe Capital redemption reserve is made up on amounts arising from the cancellation of the deferred shares.\nShare-based payment reserve includes the cumulative share-based payment charged to equity.\nShare-based payments\nThe Group operates an equity-settled share-based payment plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of awards that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity as a share-based payment reserve.\nThis plan includes market-based vesting conditions for which the fair value at grant date reflects and are therefore not subsequently revisited. The fair value is determined using a binomial model.\nWarrants\nWarrants issued as part of share issues have been determined as equity instruments under IAS 32. Since the fair value of the shares issued at the same time as the warrants is equal to the price paid, these warrants, by deduction, are considered to have been issued at fair value. No warrants have been exercised in the period or recognised in these interim consolidated financial statements. For further details of the warrants issued please refer to the Group's latest annual report at 31 December 2024.\nRelated party transactions\nThe Group discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned with the same group. It does not disclose transactions with members of the same group that are wholly owned.\nStandards in issue but not yet effective\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements there were amendments to standards which were in issue, but which were not yet effective, and which have not been applied. The principal ones were:\n\u00b7\nAmendment to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 - Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026)\n\u00b7\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027\n\u00b7\nIFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027)\nThe Directors do not expect the adoption of these amendments to standards to have a material impact on the financial statements.\n4.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgments\nIn preparing the interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the Directors have to make judgments on how to apply the Group's accounting policies and make estimates about the future. The Directors do not consider there to be any critical judgments that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements with the exception of the valuation of share-based payments. Please see Note 15 for further details.\n5.\nInterest receivable\nSix months ended\n30 June 2025\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nSix months ended 30 June 2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nBank interest receivable\n254\n1,286\n6.\nInvestments\nPrincipal subsidiary undertakings of the Group\nThe Company directly owns the ordinary share capital of its subsidiary undertakings as set out below:\nSubsidiary\nNature of business\nCountry of incorporation\nProportion of A ordinary shares held by Company\nProportion of B ordinary shares held by Company\nRed Capital Subco Limited\nIntermediate holding company\nJersey, Channel Islands\n100 per cent.\n0 per cent.\nThe address of the registered office of Red Capital Subco Limited (the \"Subco\") is 28 Esplanade, St. Helier, Channel Islands, JE2 3QA, Jersey.

The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities equals fair value given their short-term nature.\nCredit risk\nThe Group's credit risk is wholly attributable to its cash balance. All cash balances are held at a reputable bank in Jersey. The credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents is deemed to be low due to the nature and size of the balances held.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements and to invest funds securely and profitably.\n12.\nShare capital\nAllocated, called up and fully paid\nAs at\n30 June 2025\nUnaudited\nAs at\n30 June 2025 Unaudited\nAs at\n31 December 2024\nAudited\nAs at\n31 December 2024\nAudited\nNumber\n\u00a3\nNumber\n\u00a3\nOrdinary shares of 1p each\n10,000,000\n100,000\n10,000,000\n100,000\n13.\nReserves\nShare premium and retained deficit represent balances conventionally attributed to those descriptions. The transaction costs relating to the issue of shares was deducted from share premium.\nThe Capital redemption reserve is made up on amounts arising from the cancellation of the deferred shares.\nShare-based payment reserve includes the cumulative share-based payment charged to equity.\nThe Group having no regulatory or similar requirements, its primary capital management focus is on maximising earnings per share and therefore shareholder return.\n14.\nShare incentive plan\nOn 12 November 2021, the Group created a Subco Incentive Scheme within its wholly owned subsidiary Red Capital Subco Limited (\"Subco\"). Under the terms of the Subco Incentive Scheme, scheme participants are only rewarded if a predetermined level of shareholder value is created over a three to five year period or upon a change of control of the Company or Subco (whichever occurs first), calculated on a formula basis by reference to the growth in market capitalisation of the Company, following adjustments for the issue of any new Ordinary shares and taking into account dividends and capital returns (\"Shareholder Value\"), realised by the exercise by the beneficiaries of a put option in respect of their shares in Subco and satisfied either in cash or by the issue of new ordinary shares at the election of the Company.\nUnder these arrangements in place, participants are entitled to up to 15 percent of the Shareholder Value created, subject to such Shareholder Value having increased by at least 12.5 percent per annum compounded over a period of between three and five years from admission or following a change of control of the Company or Subco.\n15.\nShare-based payments\nThe Subco Incentive Scheme detailed in Note 14 is an equity-settled share option plan which allows employees and advisors of the Group to sell their B shares to the Company in exchange for a cash payment or for shares in the Company (at the Company's election) if certain conditions are met.\nThese conditions include good and bad leaver provisions and that growth in Shareholder Value of 12.5 per cent. compound per annual is delivered over a three to five year period for the scheme to vest. This second condition is therefore a market condition which has been taken into account in the measurement at grant date of the fair value of the options.\nThe B share options have a weighted average contractual life of 1 years 4 months. No B share options were issued in the six months ended 30 June 2025 and all B share options remained outstanding at the period end. No B share options were exercised in the period. No B share options have expired during the period. The weighted average exercise price of the outstanding 110,000 B share options is \u00a3Nil.\nThe Group recognised \u00a3784 (six months ended 30 June 2024: \u00a3784) of expenditure in the statement of total comprehensive income in relation to equity-settled share-based payments in the period.\nThe fair value of options granted during the period is determined by applying a binominal model. The expense is apportioned over the vesting period of the option and is based on the number which are expected to vest and the fair value of these options at the date of grant.\nThe inputs into the binomial model in respect of options granted in the period are as follows:\nOpening share price\n10.0p\nExpected volatility of share price\n16.67%\nExpected life of options\n5 years\nRisk-free rate\n0.92%\nTarget increase in share price per annum\n12.5%\nFair value of options\n7.152p\nExpected volatility was estimated by reference to the average 5-year volatility of the FTSE SmallCap Index.\nThe target increase in Shareholder Value is laid out in the Articles of Association of the Subco and represents the compounded target annual increase in market capitalisation (adjusted for capital raises and dividends) that needs to be met between the third and fifth anniversary of the Group's admission onto the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in order for the scheme to vest.\nThe Group did not enter into any share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees and advisors during the current period.\n16.\nRelated party transactions\nTransactions with key management personnel\nKey management personnel comprise the directors. The total emoluments for key management personnel in the period was \u00a325,000 (six months ended 30 June 2024: \u00a325,000).\nOther transactions\nThere are no related party transactions noted in the period.\n17.\nContingent liabilities\nThere are no contingent liabilities at the reporting date which would have a material impact on the financial statements.\n18.\nEvents after the reporting date\nThere are no events subsequent to the reporting date which would have a material impact on the financial statements.\n19.\nUltimate controlling party\nIn the opinion of the Directors, there is no single ultimate controlling party.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

IPO and RTO activity was materially behind longer term historical averages, and although there was a pick up in deal volumes towards the end of the year, the market for private companies coming to list in London remained subdued.\nAs we progress through the new financial year, we are starting to see some of the 2024 headwinds linked to the uncertainty of the UK election and certain government policy decisions dissipate, and we remain encouraged by listings reform in particular, and in general, the potential for capital inflows into the UK as a result of recent economic and political instability within the US. This could go some way in improving market liquidity and the attractiveness of London as an appropriate destination for quality private companies both from within the UK and internationally.\nWe look forward to updating further as our investment and acquisition plans develop, and would like to thank our loyal shareholders for their support and patience while we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities, that if secured, we believe have the potential to deliver value for the Group.\nDavid Williams\nChairman\n29 April 2025\nReport of the Directors\nThe Directors of the Company present their report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nPRINCIPAL ACTIVITY AND BUSINESS REVIEW\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Group and Company's principal activities were that of a holding group and company, respectively.\nThe Company was incorporated for the purpose of identifying suitable acquisition opportunities in accordance with the Company's investment and acquisition strategy. The Company will retain a flexible investment and acquisition strategy which will, subject to appropriate levels of due diligence, enable it to deploy capital in target companies by way of minority or majority investments, or full acquisitions where it is in the interests of shareholders to do so (including transactions with target companies located in the UK and internationally). It is anticipated by the Directors that acquisition opportunities could be with private companies, other listed business, or via the acquisition of divisional or non-core carve outs. The Company's strategic aim is to drive shareholder value through the acquisition of target companies in certain sectors where the Directors believe there to be sustainable growth opportunities both organically, and through acquisition. In particular, sectors of focus include business services and technology companies. Where target companies are acquired, the Directors and incoming management teams will seek to drive operational improvements and best practice to unlock revenue and cost synergies.\nIt is possible the Board may consider acquisitions that do not conform to all of the above framework. However, in all cases, the Company's strategic aim is to drive Shareholder value through the acquisition of target companies in certain sectors where the Directors believe there to be sustainable growth opportunities both organically, and through acquisition.\nThe Group and Company have actively pursued their strategy through the sourcing and assessment of acquisition and investment opportunities in the business services and technology sectors.\nRESULTS\nDuring the year, the Group recorded a loss of \u00a3233,650 (2023: loss of \u00a3215,031) and the loss per share was 2.34p (2023: loss per share of 2.15p), reflecting moderate monthly operating expenses of the Group. The Group and Company had cash reserves at the end of the year of \u00a3160,427 (2023: \u00a3399,766) and net assets of \u00a3122,729 (2023: \u00a3354,810).\nDIVIDENDS\nAt this point in the Company's development, it does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. As such, the Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend for the year.\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nThe Directors expect to continue to execute the Group's strategy in sourcing and assessing acquisition and investment opportunities across its stated sectors of focus.\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nThe Board continues to focus on maximising shareholder value by sourcing, assessing and where in the interest of shareholders to do so, investing in and acquiring businesses within the business services and technology sectors.\nFollow completion of the Company's inaugural transaction, the Board will be in a position to identify and develop its key performance indicators for on-going monitoring and management.\nGOING CONCERN\nThe Directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of the opinion that the Group and Company have adequate working capital to execute their operations over the next 12 months (\"the going concern period\"). The Group and Company's unaudited cash balance as at 10 April 2025 was \u00a3107,683. Excluding the consummation of any investment or acquisition which will likely require specific funding, the Group and Company have adequate resources available to fund the on-going forecast operating expenses during the going concern period as a result of the Group and the Company's current unaudited cash balance, as well as the provision of a letter of financial support provided by the Directors to the Group. Having also performed additional stress testing on the forecasts, the Directors are comfortable there are also sufficient mitigating actions on the incurring of expenditure within the business that could be taken, to ensure the business can meet its ongoing liabilities as they fall due. The Directors, therefore, have made an informed judgement at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements (see note 2).\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nIn order to execute the Group's strategy, the Company and its subsidiaries will be exposed to both financial and non-financial risks. The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management and it is the Board's role to consider whether those risks identified by management are acceptable within the Group's strategy and risk appetite. The Board therefore periodically reviews the principal risks and considers how effective and appropriate the controls that management has in place to mitigate the risk exposure are and will make recommendations to management accordingly.\nAs the Company had not completed its first investment or acquisition in the year, it has limited financial statements and/or historical financial data, and limited trading history. As such, the Company during the year was subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with an early-stage acquisition company, including the risk that the Company will not achieve its investment objectives and that the value of an investment could decline and may result in the partial or complete loss of capital invested. The past performance of investee companies or assets managed by the Directors will not necessarily be a guide to future business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the Company.\nIn order to mitigate against these risks, the Directors will continue to undertake thorough due diligence on investment opportunities and acquisition targets, to a level considered reasonable and appropriate by the Company on a case-by-case basis, including the potential commissioning of third-party specialist reports as appropriate. Following completion of any investment or acquisition, it is intended that any investments or assets will be managed by the Directors and assisted by the Company's professional advisers.\nFinancial Risk Management\nThe Directors consider the Group to be exposed to the following financial risks:\na.\nPrice risk: the price paid for securities is subject to market movement that will have an impact on the operations of the Group;\nb.\nCash flow interest rate risk: the Group has significant cash balances which exposed it to movement in the market interest rates; and\nc.\nLiquidity risk: the Group manages its cash requirements through detailed forecasting and planning for the amount and timing of payments and receipts of interest income, to ensure cash resources are available when required.\nGiven the relatively small size and operation of the Group in the year, the Directors have not delegated the responsibility of risk monitoring to a sub-committee of the Board, but closely monitor the risks on a periodic basis. The Directors consider their exposure in the financial year to have been low. Refer to note 14 for assessment of the risks arising from financial instruments.\nNon-financial Risk Management\nThe non-financial risk factors for the year ended 31 December 2024 did not materially change from those set out in Red's Prospectus dated 16 November 2021.\nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nAs the Company has not completed its first acquisition and has only two Directors, limited travel and no premises, the Directors do not consider any disclosure under the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures is required at this juncture, however the Company will continue to review this position as it executes its investment and acquisition strategy.\nPOLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe Company has made no political contributions during the year.\nCHARITABLE DONATIONS\nThe Company has made no charitable donations during the year.\nPOST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\nDetails of post balance sheet events are disclosed in note 20.\nSHARE CAPITAL\nDetails of the Company's share capital is set out in note 15. The Company's share capital consists of one class of ordinary share, which does not carry rights to fixed income. As at 31 December 2024, there were 10,000,000 ordinary shares of 1p par value each in issue.\nSIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDERS\nAs at 11 April 2025, the Company had been advised of the following notifiable interests (whether directly or indirectly held) in voting rights.\nName\nShareholding\nPercentage\nDavid Williams\n3,500,000\n35.0%\nSimon Webster\n2,000,000\n20.0%\nHargreaves Lansdown (Nominees) Limited\n683,480\n6.8%\nThe Bank of New York (Nominees) Limited\n477,500\n4.8%\nSecurities Services Nominees Limited\n410,000\n4.1%\nPlatform Securities Nominees Limited\n316,200\n3.2%\nRobin Southwell OBE\n300,000\n3.0%\nGiles Willits\n300,000\n3.0%\nGoldman Sachs Securities (Nominees) Limited\n300,000\n3.0%\nHuntress (CI) Nominees Limited\n300,000\n3.0%\nAs at 11 April 2025, the Directors in aggregate held 5,500,000 ordinary shares, which represents 55.0 per cent. of the Company's issued share capital.\nCOMPANY DIRECTORS\nThe Directors during the year and summaries of their experience are set out below.\nDavid Williams\nNon-Executive Chairman\n(aged 72)\nDavid has over 40 years' experience in investment markets, serving as Chairman in executive and non-executive capacities for a number of public and private companies. He has overseen the development of these companies, raising in excess of \u00a31 billion of capital to support both organic and acquisitive growth initiatives.\nDavid was the original founder of Marwyn Capital LLP, the award-winning investment management company. David was also formerly Chairman of Entertainment One Ltd. (LSE: ETO), Zetar plc, and Oxford BioDynamics Plc (AIM: OBD), and Non-Executive Director of Breedon Group plc (LSE: BREE). He currently serves as Non-Executive Chairman of the AIM-quoted cyber security business, Shearwater Group plc (AIM: SWG) and Main Market listed Acceler8 Ventures Plc (LSE: AC8) and is a Non-Executive Director of Bay Capital Plc (LSE: BAY).\nSimon Webster\nNon-Executive Director\n(age 55)\nSimon is a highly experienced software and technology entrepreneur, and is currently Group Chief Executive Officer of Vistra, a global leader in fund administration and corporate services. Prior to this he was Chief Executive Officer of CPA Global, a global leader in intellectual property software and tech-enabled services. Simon led CPA Global over a 20-year period, growing it from an initial \u00a350 million business into $6.0 billion of enterprise value before its merger with NYSE listed Clarivate Plc (NYSE: CCC) in October 2020.\nHis early career was spent in the UK financial services sector leading business change, delivering technology transformations and supporting M&A transactions.\nSimon has been investing in and working with founders of growth businesses as Founder and CEO of SHUFL Capital since 2010. He is also a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.\nThe Directors who held office during the year and their beneficial interest in the share capital of the Company at 31 December 2024 were as follows:\n31 December 2024\nDavid Williams\n3,500,000\nSimon Webster\n2,000,000\n5,500,000\nDIRECTORS REMUNERATION\nThe Chairman and Non-Executive Director are each entitled to fees of \u00a330,000 and \u00a320,000 per annum for their respective roles within the Company, as per their service agreements entered into on 15 November 2021. There are no other benefits paid to Directors outside of their service fees, save for ordinary course reimbursable expenses properly incurred in the performing their duties as Directors. The Company does not operate a pension scheme.\nSalary\nBenefits in kind\n31 December 2024 Total\nDirector\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nDavid Williams\n30,000\n-\n30,000\nSimon Webster\n20,000\n-\n20,000\n50,000\n-\n50,000\nIn addition to the Directors' fee entitlements outlined above, the Directors are also participants in the Subco Incentive Scheme and holders of warrants as detailed below.\nSUBCO INCENTIVE SCHEME\nThe Directors believe that the success of the Company will depend to a high degree on the future performance of key employees and advisers in executing and supporting the Company's growth strategy. The Company has therefore established equity-based incentive arrangements which are, and will continue to be, an important means of retaining, attracting and motivating key employees, consultants and advisers, and also for aligning the interests of the Directors with those of shareholders.\nOn 12 November 2021, the Group created a new Subco Incentive Scheme within its wholly owned subsidiary Red Capital Subco Limited. Under the terms of the Subco Incentive Scheme, scheme participants are only rewarded if a predetermined level of shareholder value is created over a three to five year period or upon a change of control of the Company or Subco (whichever occurs first), calculated on a formula basis by reference to the growth in market capitalisation of the Company, following adjustments for the issue of any new ordinary shares and taking into account dividends and capital returns (\"Shareholder Value\"), realised by the exercise by the beneficiaries of a put option in respect of their shares in Subco and satisfied either in cash or by the issue of new ordinary shares at the election of the Company.\nUnder these arrangements in place, participants are entitled up to 15 per cent. of the Shareholder Value created, subject to such Shareholder Value having increased by at least 12.5 per cent. per annum compounded over a period of between three and five years from Admission, or following a change of control of the Company or Subco.\nIn order to implement the Subco Incentive Scheme, the Company as sole shareholder of Subco, approved the creation of a new share class in Subco (the \"B Shares\"). At the same time the Subco's existing ordinary shares were redesignated A Shares. The B Shares do not have voting or dividend rights.\nOn 12 November 2021, David Williams, Chairman of the Company, Simon Webster, a Non-Executive Director of the Company, and Kathleen Long and Anthony Morris, Directors of Tessera Investment Management Limited (\"Tessera\"), became the first participants in the Subco Incentive Scheme (\"Founder Participants\"), and as such, the proportion of Shareholder Value attaching to the Subco Incentive Scheme is 11 per cent. of a total cap of 15 per cent.\nThe Founder Participants and their respective holdings are outlined below.\nParticipant\nSubco B shares held\nDavid Williams\n50,000\nSimon Webster\n40,000\nKathleen Long\n10,000\nAnthony Morris\n10,000\n110,000\nThere were no new incentives granted under the Subco Incentive Scheme during 2024.\nWARRANTS\nOn 15 November 2021, the Company constituted 10,000,000 warrants on the terms of an instrument under which the Company issued 6,000,000 warrants to certain existing shareholders of the Company including the Directors, and a further 4,000,000 warrants on admission of the Company to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe warrants are exercisable at any time from the date of completion of the inaugural transaction (an investment or acquisition) made by the Company where the consideration for such transaction is at least \u00a310 million at a price of \u00a30.10 per ordinary share. These warrants can be exercised through application to the Company. The warrants will not be listed on the London Stock Exchange or any other publicly traded market.\nThe Directors' respective warrant holdings are detailed below.\nParticipant\nDate of grant\nExercise price\nNo. of ordinary shares to which the grant relates\nDavid Williams\n15 November 2021\n\u00a30.10\n3,500,000\nSimon Webster\n15 November 2021\n\u00a30.10\n2,000,000\n5,500,000\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs a Jersey company and a Shell Company (Equity Shares) on the London Stock Exchange, under the new UK Listing Rules (\"UKLR\"), the Company is not required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. Furthermore, there is no applicable regime of corporate governance to which the directors of a Jersey company must adhere over and above the general fiduciary duties and duties of care, skill and diligence imposed on such directors under Jersey law. Notwithstanding this, the Directors are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and will be responsible for carrying out the Company's objectives and implementing its business strategy.\nAll investment, acquisition, divestment and other strategic decisions are considered and determined by the Board. At present, the Board reviews investment and acquisition opportunities on and as required basis, and meets regularly with its Strategic Advisor to discuss possible inorganic growth opportunities, as well as monitor deal flow and investment and acquisitions in progress, and review the Company's strategy to ensure that it remains aligned to the delivery of shareholder value. Those investment and acquisition opportunities that are assessed by the Board (with support from its Strategic Advisor) are considered in light of the investment and acquisition criteria as detailed in the Company's Admission Document. In addition, as part of the investment and acquisition screening process, the Company will augment Board and Strategic Advisor capability on a case by case basis as required with industry and operating partner input, where deep domain expertise can be accessed. The Board provides leadership within a framework of prudent and effective controls. The Board has established the corporate governance values of the Company and has overall responsibility for setting the Company's strategic aims, defining the business plan and strategy and managing the financial and operational resources of the Company.\nIn this regard, the Board, so far as is practicable given the Company's size and stage of its development, has voluntarily adopted the 2023 QCA Code as its chosen corporate governance framework. There are certain provisions of the QCA Code which the Company will not adhere to currently, and their adoption will be delayed until such time as the Directors believe it is appropriate to do so. It is anticipated that this will occur concurrently with the Company's first material investment or acquisition. Details on how the Company applies the ten principles of the 2023 QCA Code are set out below and on the Company's website at www.redcapitalplc.com.\nPrinciples of the QCA Code\nHow the Company has complied\n1\nEstablish a purpose, strategy and business model which promote long-term value for shareholders\nThis is outlined in the Directors Report.\n2\nPromote a corporate culture that is based on ethical values and behaviours\nThe Board operates an open and inclusive culture which is reflected in the way that the Board conducts itself. As the Company has only two Directors, the Board will formally assess and monitor corporate culture following the first acquisition / investment.\n3\nSeek to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations\nThe Chair is the Group's principal spokesperson with investors, fund managers, the press and other interested parties. As well as the Annual General Meeting with shareholders, the other Directors may give formal presentations at investor road shows following the announcement of interim and full year results.\nNotice of this year's Annual General Meeting will shortly be sent to shareholders.\nAs noted below, there are no material environmental or social matters to report to investors at this stage of the Company's development.\n4\nTake into account wider stakeholder interests, including social and environmental responsibilities and their implications for long-term success\nGiven the Company's size and stage of development, the Directors have no material environmental or social issues to report at this juncture. This will be reviewed with the relevant KPI's following execution of its investment and acquisition strategy alongside the development of a corporate and social responsibility policy.\n5\nEmbed effective risk management, internal controls and assurance activities, considering both opportunities and threats, through the organisation\nThis is outlined in the Risk Management section and the Internal Controls section below. An audit, remuneration and nomination committee will be implemented following the Company's first acquisition with appropriate terms of reference in addition to an enhanced risk management and governance framework tailored to the operating assets and strategic direction of the enlarged entity.\n6\nEstablish and maintain the board as a well-functioning balanced team led by the chair\nThe Directors have the necessary up-to-date experience, skills and capabilities required for the Board as outlined above.\nThe Directors commit sufficient time to discharge their duties as directors of the Company, and meet the expectations of their respective roles. There is no maximum time commitment specified, and outside of formal board meetings, the Directors devote additional time to the Company in respect of preparatory work and ad hoc meetings, particularly when the Company undergoes increased corporate activity.\nDuring the year, each Director attended all four of the formally scheduled quarterly Board meetings of the Company.\nDuring the year, each Director attended all four of the formally scheduled quarterly Board meetings of the Company.\nThe Board will be augmented with suitably qualified additional executive and non-executive directors including independents following the first acquisition / investment.\n7\nMaintain appropriate governance structures and ensure that individually and collectively the directors have the necessary up-to-date experience, skills and capabilities\nThe Chair is responsible for leading the Board and ensuring that the Group maintains an appropriate corporate governance framework. The Board, so far as is practicable given the Company's size and stage of its development, has voluntarily adopted the 2023 QCA Code as its chosen corporate governance framework, and compiles with those principles that the Board believe are appropriate for the Company given it has no employees nor any operations.\nEach Director has substantial experience operating within publicly listed organisations, performing executive and non-executive roles. Whilst the Company does not currently provide any formal Board training, it is through the Directors other executive and non-executive roles, and past experiences, that they maintain the necessary skills and capabilities to discharge their duties. Where specialist advice is sought for certain matters, the Directors will consult with Company advisers.\n8\nEvaluate board performance based on clear and relevant objectives, seeking continuous improvement\nIn the year, the Board evaluation process was limited to an ongoing informal evaluation of the performance of the Board by each Director. This will be replaced by a formal, annual evaluation process once the Group has completed its first acquisition covering the Board and Committees, including succession planning.\n9\nEstablish a remuneration policy which is supportive of long-term value creation and the company's purpose, strategy and culture\nWith no employees and no operations, the Group is focused on cost control and pays only minimal fees to the Directors as part of their service contracts. The principle around remuneration as detailed in the Company's prospectus remains unchanged; an incentivisation programme that is designed to drive value and build towards future monetisation events where participants are only rewarded for the delivery of shareholder value over a sustained period, and therefore have interests aligned with shareholders.\n10\nCommunicate how the company is governed and is performing by maintaining a dialogue with shareholders and other key stakeholders\nThe Board will continue to monitor its application of the 2023 QCA Code and revise its governance framework as appropriate as the Group evolves.\nThe Board recognises the importance of maintaining regular dialogue with shareholders to ensure that the Group's strategy is communicated and to understand the expectations of our shareholders.\nAs noted above, audit and remuneration committee reports will be published following the Company's first acquisition and formation of these committees.\nROLE OF THE BOARD\nThe Board is responsible for the management of the business of the Group, setting the strategic direction of the Group and establishing the policies of the Group. It is the Directors' responsibility to oversee the financial position of the Group and monitor the business and affairs of the Group, on behalf of the shareholders, to whom they are accountable. The primary duty of the Directors is to act in the best interests of the Group and Company at all times. The Board also addresses issues relating to internal control and the Group's approach to risk management and has formally adopted an anti-corruption and bribery policy.\nThe Group does not have a separate investing committee and therefore the Board as a whole will be responsible for sourcing acquisitions and ensuring that opportunities are in conformity with the Group's strategy.\nThe Group holds four formal Board meetings a year.\nThe Directors commit sufficient time to discharge their duties as directors of the Company, and meet the expectations of their respective roles. There is no maximum time commitment specified, and outside of formal board meetings, the Directors devote additional time to the Company in respect of preparatory work and ad hoc meetings, particularly when the Company undergoes increased corporate activity.\nDuring the year, each Director attended all four of the formally scheduled quarterly Board meetings of the Company.\nThe Group has not adopted a formal policy on diversity; however, it is committed to a culture of equal opportunities for all, regardless of age, race or gender. The Board is currently made up of two male directors and there are no other employees in the Company.\nINTERNAL CONTROLS\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and monitoring the Group's systems of internal control. Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, the Group's systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance that problems can be identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately.\nThe Group maintains an appropriate process for financial reporting. The annual budget is reviewed and approved by the Board before being formally adopted.\nOther key procedures that have been established and which are designed to provide effective control are as follows:\nManagement structure - The Board meets regularly on a formal and informal basis to discuss all issues affecting the Group.\nInvestment appraisal - The Group has a robust framework for investment appraisal and approval is required by the Board, where appropriate.\nShare dealing and inside information - the Company has adopted a share dealing code regulating trading and confidentiality of inside information for the Directors and other persons discharging managerial responsibilities (and their persons closely associated) which contains provisions appropriate for a company whose shares are admitted to trading on the Official List (particularly relating to dealing during closed periods which will be in line with the Market Abuse Regulation). The Company takes all reasonable steps to ensure compliance by the Directors and any relevant employees with the terms of that share dealing code.\nThe Board reviews the effectiveness of the systems of internal control and considers the major business risks and the control environment. No significant deficiencies have come to light during the period and no weaknesses in internal financial control have resulted in any material losses, or contingencies which would require disclosure, as recommended by the guidance for Directors on reporting on internal financial control.\nThe Directors are focused on careful management of the Group's cash and financial resources through Board level approvals. At such time that the Group completes an acquisition, the Directors anticipate that the Group's financial position and prospects procedures regime will be updated and expanded as necessary to cater for the nature of the Group's business following completion of its inaugural investment or acquisition.\nEXTERNAL ADVISERS\nThe Board accessed the following external advisers during the year and post the year end for ongoing business as usual matters:\nMayer Brown International LLP and Ogier (Jersey) LLP - legal\nTessera Investment Management Limited - capital markets and M&A\nJTC Plc - company secretarial, governance and regulatory filings\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nA Director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company. The Board has satisfied itself that there are no conflicts of interest where the Directors have appointments on the Boards of, or relationships with, companies outside the Company. Furthermore, the Board requires Directors to declare all appointments and other situations which could result in a possible conflict of interest, and therefore believes it has a robust framework to deal with any conflict of interest should it arise.\nDISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR\nSo far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group and Company's auditor is unaware, and each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group and Company's auditor is aware of that information.\nThe Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge that:\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;\n\u00b7\nthe Chairman's Statement and Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and\n\u00b7\nthe annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR\nThe auditor, MHA, previously traded through the legal entity MacIntyre Hudson LLP. In response to regulatory changes, MacIntyre Hudson LLP ceased to hold an audit registration with the engagement transitioning to MHA Audit Services LLP. The auditor, MHA, will be proposed for re-appointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\nDavid Williams\nChairman\n29 April 2025\nStatement of Directors' Responsibilities\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors' report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\nJersey Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (\"IFRS\") and the Company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 \"Reduced disclosure Framework\", the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year.\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\u00b7\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n\u00b7\nmake judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n\u00b7\nstate whether the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the United Kingdom;\n\u00b7\nstate whether the Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 \"Reduced Disclosure Framework\"; and\n\u00b7\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nThe maintenance and integrity of the Group's website is the responsibility of the Directors. The work carried out by the auditors does not involve the consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred in the accounts since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of the accounts and the other information included in annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n2024\n2023\nNote\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAdministrative expenses\n(235,685)\n(219,092)\nOperating loss\n6\n(235,685)\n(219,092)\nInterest receivable\n7\n2,035\n4,061\nLoss on ordinary activities before taxation\n(233,650)\n(215,031)\nTaxation charge\n8\n-\n-\nLoss and total comprehensive loss for the year\n(233,650)\n(215,031)\nLoss per share (pence)\nBasic and diluted\n9\n(2.34p)\n(2.15p)\nLoss attributable to:\nOwners of the parent company\n(233,650)\n(215,031)\nThe Group has no items of other comprehensive income in either the current or prior period.

The Company is the parent company of Red Capital Subco Limited (a private limited company under the laws of Jersey with registered number 134741), and together form the \"Group\".\nThe address of its registered office is 28 Esplanade, St. Helier, Channel Islands, JE2 3QA, Jersey.\nThe Group has been incorporated for the purpose of identifying suitable acquisition opportunities in accordance with the Group's investment and acquisition strategy with a view to creating shareholder value. The Group will retain a flexible investment and acquisition strategy which will, subject to appropriate levels of due diligence, enable it to deploy capital in target companies by way of minority or majority investments, or full acquisitions where it is in the interests of shareholders to do so. This will include transactions with target companies located in the UK and internationally.\n2\nMaterial accounting policies\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in theses consolidated financial statements.\nThe principal policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as follows:\n(a) Basis of preparation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (\"IFRS\") and the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.\nThe comparative figures presented cover the year ended to 31 December 2023.\n(b) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.\nWhere the Group has control over a Company, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Group controls a Company if all three of the following elements are present: power over the Company, exposure to variable returns from the Company, and the ability of the Group to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The acquisition related costs are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on an accruals basis. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.\n(c) Functional and presentational currency\nThe Group's functional and presentational currency for these financial statements is the pound sterling.\n(d) Going concern\nThe Directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of the opinion that the Group and Company have adequate working capital to execute their operations over the next 12 months (\"the going concern period\"). The Group and Company's unaudited cash balance as at 10 April 2025 was \u00a3107,683. Excluding the consummation of any investment or acquisition which will likely require specific funding, the Group and Company have adequate resources available to fund the on-going forecast operating expenses during the going concern period as a result of the Group and the Company's current unaudited cash balance, as well as the provision of a letter of financial support provided by the Directors to the Group. Having also performed additional stress testing on the forecasts, the Directors are comfortable there are also sufficient mitigating actions on the incurring of expenditure within the business that could be taken, to ensure the business can meet its ongoing liabilities as they fall due. The Directors, therefore, have made an informed judgement at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements (see note 2).\n(e) Interest receivable\nInterest receivable is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.\n(f) Employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n(g) Taxation\nTax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.\n(h) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less from inception, held for meeting short term commitments.\n(i) Financial assets and liabilities\nThe Group's financial assets and liabilities comprise cash and cash equivalents and accruals. Financial assets are stated at amortised cost less provision for expected credit losses. Financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost.\n(j) Equity\nEquity comprises of share capital, share premium, capital redemption reserve, share-based payment reserve and retained deficit.\nShare capital is measured at the par value.\nShare premium and retained deficit represent balances conventionally attributed to those descriptions. The transaction costs relating to the issue of shares was deducted from share premium.\nThe Capital redemption reserve is made up on amounts arising from the cancellation of the deferred shares.\nShare-based payment reserve includes the cumulative share-based payment charged to equity.\n(k) Share-based payments\nThe Group operates an equity-settled share-based payment plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of awards that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity as a share-based payment reserve.\nThis plan includes market-based vesting conditions for which the fair value at grant date reflects and are therefore not subsequently revisited. The fair value is determined using a binomial model.\n(l) Related party transactions\nThe Group discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned with the same group. It does not disclose transactions with members of the same group that are wholly owned.\n(m) Warrants\nWarrants issued as part of share issues have been determined as equity instruments under IAS 32. Since the fair value of the shares issued at the same time as the warrants is equal to the price paid, these warrants, by deduction, are considered to have been issued at fair value.\n(n) Accounting standards issued\nThe following amendments to standards were issued and adopted in the year, with no material impact on the financial statements (all effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024):\n\u00b7\nAmendment to IFRS 16 Leases - Leases on sale and leaseback\n\u00b7\nAmendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Non-current liabilities with covenants\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Supplier finance\nThere were no other new accounting standards issued that have been adopted in the year.\n(o) Standards in issue but not yet effective\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements there were amendments to standards which were in issue, but which were not yet effective, and which have not been applied. The principal ones are detailed below. The Directors do not expect the adoption of these amendments to standards to have a material impact on the financial statements.\nEffective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025:\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates - Lack of exchangeability\n\u00b7\nIntroduction of IFRS 18 to replace IAS 1 - Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n3\nAccounting estimates and judgements\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have to make judgments on how to apply the Group's accounting policies and make estimates about the future. The Directors do not consider there to be any critical judgments that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements with the exception of the valuation of share-based payments. Please see note 18 for further details.\n4\nEmployees\nStaff costs, including Directors, consist of:\n2024\n\u00a3\n2023\n\u00a3\nWages and salaries\n50,000\n50,000\n_______\n_______\n50,000\n50,000\n_______\n_______\n2024\n2023\nNumber\nNumber\nThe average number of employees, including Directors, during the year was:\n2\n_______\n2\n_______\n5\nDirectors' remuneration\nThe Company Directors are considered the only key management personnel and their remuneration was as follows:\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nDirectors' emoluments\n50,000\n50,000\n________\n________\n50,000\n50,000\n________\n________\n6\nOperating loss\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nThis has been arrived at after charging:\nProfessional services\n127,329\n131,896\nFees payable to the Company's independent auditor for the audit of the parent and consolidated accounts\n25,000\n20,000\n________\n________\n7\nInterest receivable\n2024\n\u00a3\n2023\n\u00a3\nBank interest receivable\n2,035\n4,061\n2,035\n4,061\n________\n________\n8\nTaxation\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nJersey corporation tax\nCorporation tax on loss for the year\n-\n-\n________\n________\nTotal taxation on loss on ordinary activities\n-\n-\n________\n________\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss before tax\n(233,650)\n(215,031)\n________\n________\nTax for financial service companies at 10% (2023: 10%)\n(23,365)\n(21,503)\nEffect of:\nTax losses on which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised\n23,365\n21,503\n________\n________\nTotal taxation on loss on ordinary activities\n-\n-\n________\n________\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry forward tax losses/credits can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences and carry forward tax losses as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 respectively, as it is not probable at year end that relevant taxable profits will be available in future based on the current activities of the Group as a holding group. There are no expiry dates on these tax losses as at the year end.

All cash balances are held at a reputable bank in Jersey. The credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents is deemed to be low due to the nature and size of the balances held.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nThe Group's approach to liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements and to invest funds securely and profitably.\nThe following table details the contractual maturity of financial liabilities based on the dates the liabilities are due to be settled:\nFinancial liabilities:\nLess than 1 year\n2 to 5 Years\nMore than 5 years\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAccruals\n44,800\n-\n-\n44,800\n_________\n_________\n_________\n_________\nAt 31 December 2024\n44,800\n-\n-\n44,800\n_________\n_________\n_________\n_________\nLess than 1 year\n2 to 5 Years\nMore than 5 years\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAccruals\n54,242\n-\n-\n54,242\n_________\n_________\n_________\n_________\nAt 31 December 2023\n54,242\n-\n-\n54,242\n_________\n_________\n_________\n_________\n15\nShare capital\nAllotted, called up and fully paid\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNumber\nNumber\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nOrdinary shares of 1p each:\n10,000,000\n10,000,000\n100,000\n100,000\n_________\n_________\n_________\n_________\nAt 31 December 2024\n10,000,000\n10,000,000\n100,000\n100,000\n_________\n_________\n_________\n_________\nAll shares are equally eligible to receive dividends and the repayment of capital and represent one vote at the shareholders' meeting of the Company.\nFollowing a sub-division and re-designation of share capital in 2021, the issued share capital of the Company included 180 deferred shares of a par value of \u00a30.01 each. On 28 October 2021, in accordance with article 5B of the Articles, the Company redeemed for nil consideration the deferred shares. Any amounts standing to the credit of any nominal or share premium account relating to deferred shares that were redeemed were credited to a capital reserve of the Company (see note 16) and are available for use in accordance with the Companies Law.\nPursuant to the IPO Placing in November 2021, 4,000,000 ordinary shares were issued and allotted at a price of \u00a30.10 per ordinary shares to certain new investors, for aggregate consideration of \u00a3400,000 in cash. Warrants with the right to subscribe for further ordinary shares in the Company were issued for every ordinary share subscribed for. No warrants have been exercised in the year or recognised to date in these consolidated financial statements (2023: \u00a3Nil).\n16\nReserves\nShare premium and retained earnings represent balances conventionally attributed to those descriptions. The transaction costs relating to the issue of shares was deducted from share premium.\nCapital redemption reserve includes amounts in relation to deferred shared capital.\nThe Group having no regulatory capital or similar requirements, its primary capital management focus is on maximising earnings per share and therefore shareholder return.\nThe Directors have proposed that there will be no final dividend in respect of 2024 (2023: \u00a3Nil).\n17\nShare Incentive Plan\nOn 12 November 2021, the Group created a Subco Incentive Scheme within its wholly owned subsidiary Red Capital Subco Limited (\"Subco\"). Under the terms of the Subco Incentive Scheme, scheme participants are only rewarded if a predetermined level of shareholder value is created over a three to five year period or upon a change of control of the Company or Subco (whichever occurs first), calculated on a formula basis by reference to the growth in market capitalisation of the Company, following adjustments for the issue of any new Ordinary shares and taking into account dividends and capital returns (\"Shareholder Value\"), realised by the exercise by the beneficiaries of a put option in respect of their shares in Subco and satisfied either in cash or by the issue of new ordinary shares at the election of the Company.\nUnder these arrangements in place, participants are entitled to up to 15 percent of the Shareholder Value created, subject to such Shareholder Value having increased by at least 12.5 percent per annum compounded over a period of between three and five years from admission or following a change of control of the Company or Subco.\n18\nShare-based payments\nThe Subco Incentive Scheme detailed in note 17 is an equity-settled share option plan which allows employees and advisors of the Group to sell their B shares to the Company in exchange for a cash payment or for shares in the Company (at the Company's election) if certain conditions are met.\nThese conditions include good and bad leaver provisions and that growth in Shareholder Value of 12.5 percent compound per annum is delivered over a three to five year period for the scheme to vest. This second condition is therefore a market condition which has been taken into account in the measurement at grant date of the fair value of the options.\nThe weighted average exercise price of the outstanding B share options is \u00a30.10 which have a weighted average contractual life of 1 years 10 months. 110,000 B share options were issued in the nine-month period to 31 December 2021, all of which were outstanding at the current year end. No B share options were exercised in the current or prior period. No B share options have expired during the current or prior period.\nThe Group recognised \u00a31,569 (2023: \u00a31,567) of expenditure in the statement of total comprehensive income relating to equity-settled share-based payments in the year.\nThe fair value of options granted during the year is determined by applying a binomial model. The expense is apportioned over the vesting period of the option and is based on the number which are expected to vest and the fair value of these options at the date of grant.\nThe inputs into the binomial model in respect of options granted in 2021 are as follows:\nOpening share price\n10.0p\nExpected volatility of share price\n16.67%\nExpected life of options\n5 years\nRisk-free rate\n0.92%\nTarget increase in share price per annum\n12.5%\nFair value of options\n7.152p\nExpected volatility was estimated by reference to the average 5-year volatility of the FTSE SmallCap Index.\nThe target increase in Shareholder Value is laid out in the Articles of Association of the Subco and represents the compounded target annual increase in market capitalisation (adjusted for capital raises and dividends) that needs to be met between the third and the fifth anniversary of the Group's admission onto Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in order for the scheme to vest.\nThe Group did not enter into any share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees and advisors during the current or prior period.\n19\nRelated party transactions\nTransactions with key management personnel\nKey management personnel comprise the Directors and executive officers. The remuneration of the individual Directors is disclosed in the Report of Directors.\nOther transactions\nOn 1 November 2021, the Group entered into an arm's length strategic advisory agreement with Tessera (a shareholder of the Company) pursuant to which Tessera has agreed to provide strategic and general corporate advice, and acquisition and capital raising transaction support services to the Group. Tessera is entitled to be paid a fixed monthly retainer fee of \u00a35,000 (plus VAT) per month payable in arrears. A discretionary transaction success fee payable to Tessera may be agreed between the Group and Tessera with such payment payable on successful completion of an acquisition by the Group. As at 31 December 2024, Tessera was owed \u00a3Nil (2023: \u00a3Nil) by the Group for accrued monthly retainer fees.\n20\nPost balance sheet events\nThere are no events subsequent to the reporting date which would have a material impact on the financial statements.\n21\nContingent liabilities\nThere are no contingent liabilities at the reporting date which would have a material impact on the financial statements.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
