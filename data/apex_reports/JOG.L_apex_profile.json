          "content": "14 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 7771O\nJersey Oil and Gas PLC\n14 January 2026\n14\nJanuary 2026\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\n(\"Jersey Oil & Gas\", \"JOG\"\nor the\n\"Company\")\nCorporate Update\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM: JOG), an independent upstream oil and gas company \u200efocused on the UK Continental Shelf region of the North Sea, is pleased to provide a corporate update and outlook for the year ahead.\nHighlights\n\u00a7\nOutcome of the UK Government's regulatory and fiscal consultations have been set - providing an opportunity to optimise the investment programme for development projects like Buchan\n\u00a7\nWork planned to assess the optimal Buchan development solution within the re-set investment horizon\n\u00a7\nBuchan joint venture partners are materially growing through further corporate consolidations - Buchan well positioned\n\u00a7\nJOG's solid financial position maintained - the business is right-sized for its current activities and focused on achieving its growth potential\nUK Oil & Gas Industry Landscape\n\u00a7\nFollowing the lengthy regulatory and fiscal consultations carried out by the UK Government during 2025, clarity was finally obtained in the latter part of the year on both the future application of environmental regulations and the longer-term fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry. The environmental consultation confirmed the need for oil and gas developments like Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") to assess the Scope 3 emissions arising from the project as part of its regulatory approval submissions. In terms of the fiscal regime, the consultation resulted in the continued application of the Energy Profits Levy (\"EPL\") in its current form until 1 April 2030, which implies a marginal tax rate of 78% for the industry. The successor regime, the Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (\"OGPM\"), replaces the EPL with a revenue-based model for calculating windfall profits, that levies a 35% tax only on the revenues generated above applicable commodity threshold prices (in addition to the corporate and supplementary tax rate of 40%).\n\u00a7\nUnder the OGPM two independent threshold price points will be set annually, one for oil (in dollars per barrel) and one for gas (in pence per therm). The thresholds in financial year 2026-27 have been set at $90/bbl for oil and 90p/therm for gas - they will be adjusted annually in line with CPI inflation and are projected to be around $98/bbl and 98p/therm by 2030. When in effect the OGPM restores the tax rate to the 40% headline rate in the permanent regime, with the OGPM only applying to oil or gas revenues in the event the respective commodity price is unusually high.\n\u00a7\nThe interplay between the EPL and OGPM regimes provides tax\npaying companies with the opportunity to continue securing a 78% tax offset (including 38% attributable to the EPL) for every pound invested between now and 2030 (or 84.25% when including the investment allowance available on the Supplementary Charge Tax), alongside the potential to generate revenue from those investing activities post 2030 with just the permanent 40% tax rate applicable so long as commodity prices remain under the OGPM threshold prices. This points to it being optimal for long term investments being undertaken between now and the end of the decade.\n\u00a7\nAlongside the changes in the regulatory and fiscal landscape, 2025 was also marked by a step change in the scale of both our Buchan joint venture partners. NEO Energy Limited, the operator for the Buchan development project, not only combined its business with the UK subsidiary of Repsol S.A., but in December 2025 it announced a subsequent merger with the UK business of TotalEnergies S.A., to create NEO Next+ (\"NEO\").\n\u00a7\nUpon completion of the NEO Next+ transaction, NEO will become the leading operator and producer in the UK North Sea, with an expected production portfolio of over 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\").\n\u00a7\nSerica Energy (\"Serica\") (AIM: SQZ) also announced a series of strategic acquisitions during the year, establishing the business as the leading mid-tier UK North Sea producer.\nGreater Buchan Area\n\u00a7\nThe major transformations that have taken place with NEO and Serica places the growth prospects that the Buchan project provides within two high-quality, UK North Sea focused asset portfolios. Access to a project with estimated gross mid case proven and probable resources of approximately 70 million barrels of oil equivalent represents a material prize at this stage of the UK North Sea lifecycle.\n\u00a7\nThere continues to be active engagement between the Buchan joint venture partners, particularly around the key strategic engineering decisions and plans for the development. Work is progressing to prepare the necessary addendum to the Buchan Environmental Impact Assessment incorporating the requirements of the updated guidance regarding the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions, as well as setting out the socio-economic benefits to the UK that the development will deliver. Value engineering work is also being completed, particularly with respect to drilling and subsea infrastructure scopes of work, as part of the pre-sanction technical work aimed at optimising the capital expenditure programme for developing the field.\n\u00a7\nNEO's recent strategic moves also provide the Buchan joint venture with the means to assess the development solution for the field with a wider lens. While the \"Western Isles\" floating production, storage and offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel has been set out as the development solution in the draft Field Development Plan (\"FDP\"), the passage of time resulting from the delays caused by the Government's industry consultations means other potential production solutions warrant further screening and consideration. As such, the FPSO represents one of several options for Buchan. Additional development engineering activities to evaluate these alternatives will now form part of the project work programme to be completed during 2026.\n\u00a7\nThe Greater Buchan Area (\"GBA\") partners elected to partially relinquish a portion of the P2170 \"Verbier\" licence acreage in late 2025. This enabled an approximately 40% reduction in licence fees, attributable to the cost of the area that\ncontained the highest risk exploration prospect on the licence (the retained licence area still contains the Verbier and J2 discoveries and the \"Verbier Deep\" and \"Cortina\" exploration prospects). The Company's P2170 licence costs are not carried by its Buchan joint venture partners.\n\u00a7\nThe P2498 (\"Buchan\") and P2170 licences are both in the Second Term, the period in which licencees need to obtain FDP approval in order to subsequently move into the Third Term, which covers the development and production phase of activities for the life of a field. The end of the Second Term of the P2498 licence is 28 February 2027 and 29 August 2026 for the P2170 licence. Significant progress has been made on the Buchan development, which facilitates unlocking the wider GBA resource base contained in licence P2170, and an application to extend the Second Term duration of both licences will be made to the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\") during the current year. With the draft FDP and associated Environmental Impact Assessment for the Buchan development already submitted to the NSTA, the regulator is fully briefed on the joint venture's plans for the GBA and NEO is well placed to continue its engagement with the regulator on the proposed extensions.\nStrategic Focus\n\u00a7\nThe Company's vision is centred on successfully growing the business in a smart and sustainable way, developing important domestic energy supply in response to society's energy needs and creating value for our stakeholders. The organisation is \"right sized\" for the stage and scale of its activities and maintains a nimble approach to advancing its key strategic objectives.\n\u00a7\nThe Company remains sharply focused on unlocking the organic value of its existing assets in the GBA, combined with the pursuit of potential accretive asset acquisitions that bring cash flow, diversity and quality investment opportunities into the portfolio.\n\u00a7\nWith over \u00a3100 million of UK tax allowances, including an element of EPL losses, UK North Sea opportunities continue to be thoroughly assessed in terms of their potential strategic fit. The Company is also evaluating international producing asset opportunities which have the potential to sensibly deploy the financial resources of the business.\nSolid Financial Position\n\u00a7\nThe Company's cash balance at the end of 2025 was approximately \u00a311 million with no debt.\n\u00a7\nThe cash running cost of the business were reduced by approximately 50% at the end of 2024, as a result of the actions taken following the slowdown in activities on the Buchan project. As a result total cash expenditure in 2025 is expected to be approximately \u00a31.5 million, with the corresponding cash cost for 2026 currently projected to be a little under this level absent any changes in the underlying activities of the business.\n\u00a7\nPer the terms of the farm-out agreements executed with NEO and Serica, the Company's 20% share of Buchan project expenditure is fully carried by its two joint venture partners. A further $20 million cash payment is payable under the terms of the agreements following approval of the FDP by the NSTA and receipt of the associated regulatory and legal consents.\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"It is clear that the regulatory and fiscal consultations the Government has undertaken since coming into office in July 2024 have disrupted the UK North Sea oil and gas industry and stifled investment activities. However, the outcome of the consultations have now been finalised and the fiscal terms within which to best optimise investment decisions have been set. These terms point to a longer investment cycle over the coming years, which maximises value across the applicable fiscal regimes. For Buchan, taking the time now, to verify and engineer the best possible development solution within that cycle, should ultimately enhance the overall value of the project for all parties.\nWhile the Government has been working to set the overall parameters in which the industry operates, the corporate landscape has also evolved. Most notably our joint venture partner and Buchan field operator, NEO Next+, on completion of its latest deal, will establish itself as the largest operator and producer in the UK North Sea. This represents an exciting step, both for us to be working alongside the leading player in the basin and to be part of one of the key growth opportunities in its asset portfolio. The Greater Buchan Area, with estimated gross resources of over 100 MMboe and significant exploration upside, represents a material opportunity on a standalone basis and within the outlook of the UK sector as a whole.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero.

This has the potential to unlock significant UK investment, create over 1,000 well paid jobs and ultimately realise hundreds of millions in future tax payments to the exchequer. We urge the government to complete its consultation process on the future fiscal regime and remove the EPL in order to establish a playing field that facilitates future investments. Homegrown energy should be prioritised over more carbon intensive energy imports and with Buchan, we have a great opportunity to be at the forefront of championing a fully integrated production hub that aligns with the industry's decarbonisation strategy.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero. JOG holds a 20% interest in each of licences P2498 (Blocks 20/5a, 20/5e and 21/1a) and P2170 (Blocks 20/5b and 21/1d) located in the UK Central North Sea and referred to as the \"Greater Buchan Area\" (\"GBA\"). Licence P2498 contains the Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") oil field and J2 oil discovery and licence P2170 contains the Verbier oil discovery.\nJOG's strategy is focused on unlocking the organic value of its GBA assets, combined with the pursuit of potential asset acquisitions that bring cash flow, diversity and quality investment opportunities into the portfolio. The Company's Board and Executive team have a wealth of experience in managing and growing publicly listed energy companies and a strong track-record of value creation in the UK North Sea's oil and gas sector.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the usual risk factors and uncertainties associated with an oil and gas business. Whilst the Company believes the expectations reflected herein to be reasonable in light of the information available to it at this time, the actual outcome may be materially different owing to factors beyond the Company's control or otherwise within the Company's control but where, for example, the Company decides on a change of plan or strategy.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REPORT\nFollowing the progress made in 2023 and 2024 to advance the Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") redevelopment project towards sanction and Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval, the first half of this year has involved a concerted effort to engage with the UK government on the future of the UK North Sea and the fundamentals required to maximise the long term value of the oil and gas industry for the benefit of all. This engagement has been driven by the three public consultations that have been launched by the government since taking office in July 2024 concerning the inclusion of \"Scope 3\" emissions in environmental impact assessments (\"EIAs\"), the future for UK North Sea oil and gas licensing and the long-term fiscal regime.\nOur team has worked closely with our Buchan joint venture partners, NEO NEXT Energy (\"NEO\") and Serica Energy (\"Serica\"), and industry trade bodies to shape our responses to the public consultations. We are encouraged that the government has now issued new guidelines for EIA submissions and this should pave the way for new development projects like Buchan to secure formal approval following over a year of regulatory inactivity. This will naturally require an addendum to the previously submitted Buchan EIA to be issued to the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for the Environment and Decommissioning (\"OPRED\") as part of the overall regulatory process required to reach FDP approval.\nWhile clarity has been obtained on the environmental guidelines for new developments, the conclusions to the fiscal and licensing consultations remain outstanding. Most significantly, it is the outcome of the fiscal consultation that will dictate the ability of the joint venture to progress Buchan towards project sanction and FDP approval\nDevelopment Activities\nThe uncertainties created by the various abovementioned fiscal and regulatory consultations resulted in a slowdown in the Buchan redevelopment project's activities in 2024. Nevertheless, targeted activities have continued during the first half of 2025, with a key focus being on how to incorporate Scope 3 emissions into the Buchan environmental statement. The joint venture has been working with Genesis, a leading energy consulting company that supported the initial regulatory submission, to undertake the necessary additional preparatory work. A number of other technical and commercial workflows have also been progressed throughout the period, including the continuation of subsurface modelling studies, the specification of the optimal drilling completion plan for the requisite production wells and the agreement of commercial terms for the utilisation of gas export infrastructure. Alongside the preparation of the environmental statement addendum, work is also scheduled to commence on value engineering opportunities and optimisations around the forecast capital expenditure for the project. This represents an important element of the assurance and peer review processes that the joint venture undertakes as part of the project sanction and regulatory approval activities.\nIn light of the project delays created by the various consultations, an extension to the Buchan P2498 licence was obtained from the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\") earlier in the year. The extension gives the joint venture until 28 February 2027 to obtain Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the timing of FDP approval, the agreement for the acquisition of the \"Western Isles\" floating production, storage and offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel for redeployment on the Buchan field was terminated in March 2025 by Dana Petroleum after the longstop date in the agreement was passed. NEO, Buchan's Operator, is a 23% owner of the vessel and the possibility remains to recontract the vessel at the appropriate time for deployment on Buchan. The vessel remains anchored in Scapa Flow in the Orkney Isles, having departed the Western Isles field location in summer 2024.\nSubject to satisfactory clarity being obtained from the government consultations, there are clear steps that need to be completed to move the Buchan project forward to FDP approval and onward thereafter into the development execution phase of activities. These are:\n\u00a7\nReactivation and completion of the contract tender process for the main drilling, subsea and FPSO modification workscopes\n\u00a7\nRe-contracting of the FPSO\n\u00a7\nSubmission to OPRED of an updated EIA that incorporates the requirements of the recently issued guidance concerning the inclusion of Scope 3 emission forecasts for the project\n\u00a7\nJoint venture finalisation of the FDP and approval of the NSTA\nWhile the exact timeline for completing these activities has not yet been finalised, it is likely that a positive outcome from the consultations would lead to FDP approval being targeted during 2026.\nSupport for Domestic Industry\nThe facts point time and time again to a balanced energy system providing the best solution to our country's energy security. Unfortunately, the net zero debate has become polarised, unnecessarily pitting domestic hydrocarbons against green alternatives - the stark reality is that we need it all to satisfy the country's energy demands and minimise hydrocarbon imports. In the case of Buchan, the project has the potential to contribute approximately 70 million barrels of oil equivalent (\"Mmboe\") to future North Sea production. Importantly, it also provides the opportunity to unlock capital investment of around \u00a31 billion into the UK economy, create over 1,000 well paid jobs across the UK, generate a new energy hub that helps facilitate investment into a major new floating offshore wind project and pay hundreds of millions in tax to the Exchequer. It is therefore hoped that the positive economic impact that Buchan, and potential other North Sea projects like it, can have on the UK, will be recognised in the actions of the government as it works to close out its on-going fiscal and regulatory consultations over the coming months. The UK needs economic growth and a project like Buchan would be particularly accretive to the economy for years to come.\nThe fiscal consultation is of critical importance to our project and we are hopeful of seeing clarity on this aspect during the Autumn Statement. The alternative oil and gas pricing mechanisms that have been tabled as a replacement for the Energy Profits Levy (\"EPL\"), which punitively taxes all profits at 78%, sets a threshold price above which a windfall tax would be charged. While the mechanisms being considered are workable alternatives, the key elements concerning the actual commodity prices at which the additional tax would kick in, and the level of the tax itself, are yet to be defined. We are far from being in a windfall commodity price environment, as has been reflected in other countries which imposed similar windfall taxes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and have now removed them. To mitigate some of the damage the EPL has already done, industry is urging the government to replace it with the mechanism resulting from the current consultation rather than waiting until 2030 when it is currently scheduled to fall away.\nSolid Financial Position\nFinancially the Group is strongly positioned with total cash reserves at the end of H1 2025 of \u00a311.3 million and no debt.\nThe total annualised cash running cost of the business has been reduced by approximately 50% to an expected \u00a31.5 million. In addition to cutting corporate and operational costs, all staff and Directors' salaries have been reduced by 50% to reflect the slowdown in Buchan project activities at this time.\nAs a result of the terms of the farm-out agreements executed with NEO and Serica, the Company's 20% share of Buchan project expenditure is fully carried by our two joint venture partners, based on the approved FDP budget. A further $20 million in cash is receivable under the terms of the farm-out agreements following approval of the Buchan FDP by the NSTA and receipt of the associated regulatory and legal consents.\nSummary and Outlook\nJOG is well placed financially to see through this period of protracted uncertainty for the industry, however the reduction in investment activity witnessed across the UK Continental Shelf as a direct result of the EPL is damaging sentiment and driving investment elsewhere. We urge the government to remove the EPL as soon as practicable. All forms of domestic energy must rank above more carbon intensive energy imports and with Buchan, we have a great opportunity to be at the forefront of championing a fully integrated production hub that aligns with the industry's decarbonisation strategy.\nThere is also more for us to do as we seek to grow our business in the North Sea. To both accelerate potential value creation from the Company's existing UK tax allowances of over $100 million and bring cash flow into the business, a number of potential producing asset acquisitions have been pursued and we continue to be proactive in our efforts to grow the business for the collective benefit of our shareholders and other stakeholders. We greatly appreciate and value the support and patience we have received from our shareholders at this complicated time for the industry.\nLes Thomas\nNon-Executive Chairman\nAndrew Benitz\nChief

The address of its registered office is 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London WC2H 9JQ.\nThe reporting period for the Group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements is the six-month period from 1 January 2025 to 30 June 2025, which were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 3 September 2025.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Preparation\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 were prepared in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\").\nThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared following the same accounting policies and methods of computation as the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company's annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe financial information contained herein does not constitute statutory financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nConsolidated statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024, on which the auditors gave an unqualified audit report, have been filed with the Registrar of Companies.\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the Group's functional currency.\nGoing Concern\nThe Group has sufficient resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months after the date of issue of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. The Company's current cash reserves are expected to more than exceed its estimated cash outflows in all reasonable scenarios for at least 12 months following the date of issue of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Even in a scenario where the Buchan redevelopment project did not progress for whatever reason(s) and the future farm-out instalment payments were not realised the Group has the funds to continue in business beyond the next 12 months solely from utilisation of its existing cash resources. The directors have also considered the risk associated with contractual arrangements associated with progression of the Buchan redevelopment project and are satisfied that the Group is not exposed to any contractual commitments which could impact on the Group's going concern status over the next 12 months. Based on these circumstances, the directors have considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nAccounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's latest audited annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe impact of seasonality or cyclicality on operations is not considered significant on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\n3. SEGMENTAL REPORTING\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board of Directors.\nThe Board considers that the Group operates in a single segment, that of oil and gas exploration, appraisal, development, and production, in a single geographical location, the North Sea of the United Kingdom.\nThe Board as a whole is the Group's chief operating decision maker within the meaning of IFRS 8 \"Operating Segments\".\nDuring the period to 30 June 2025 and during the year ended 31 December 2024 the Group had no revenue.\n4. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nThe following significant costs are included:\n30/06/25\n30/06/24\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nThird Party Transaction Fees / Bonuses\n-\n1,187,661\nNon-Cash Share Based Payments (net)\n(67,531)\n541,889\nThe H1 2024 Transaction Fees/Bonuses include payments of \u00a3490,000 to the Executive Directors earned because of the Serica Farm-out and settled conditional upon deal completion. Non-Cash Share Based Payments decreased in H1 2025 mainly due to share options issued to Directors in January 2018 expiring in January 2025.\n5. TAX\nJersey Oil and Gas plc is a trading company but no liability to UK corporation tax arose on its ordinary activities for the period ended 30 June 2025 due to trading losses. As at 31 December 2024, the Group held tax losses of approximately \u00a362m (2023: \u00a363m).\n6. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic loss per share is calculated by dividing the losses attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nThere is no difference between dilutive and basic loss per share due to there being a loss recorded in the period.\nThe share options issued in the Group that would potentially dilute earnings per share in the future have not been included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nLosses attributable to ordinary shareholders\nWeighted average number of shares\nPer share amount\nPence\n\u00a3\nPeriod ended 30\u00a0June\u00a02025\nBasic and Diluted EPS\nLoss attributable to ordinary shareholders\n(697,258)\n32,667,627\n(2.13)\n7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nExploration\nCosts\n\u00a3\nCOST\nAt 1 January 2025\n11,916,647\nAdditions\n54,570\nAt 30 June 2025\n11,971,217\nACCUMULATED AMORTISATION\nAt 1 January 2025\n175,241\nAt 30 June 2025\n175,241\nCARRYING AMOUNT 30 June 2025\n11,795,976\nAdditions represent the work capitalised on the Buchan redevelopment assets.\nAt the start of 2023 the Company owned 100% interests in two licenses; P2498 containing the Buchan field and J2 Discovery, and P2170 containing the Verbier discovery.\nAt the end of 2023 the costs incurred in acquiring and advancing the licenses to their current state was \u00a325,700,982 (2022: \u00a324,548,122). During 2023 a farm-out of a 50% interest in both licenses to NEO was completed and in 2024 a farm out of a 30% interest in both licenses to Serica was completed. Both deals had similar terms whereby in exchange for the farm in, the respective parties agreed to a series of cash payments and both a pre-development and development carry on the Buchan Redevelopment project. In accordance with our farm-out policy for assets at that stage of development, the cash proceeds of \u00a35,519,216 in 2024 and \u00a39,103,944 in 2023 were both deducted from the carrying value of the assets.\nIn line with the requirements of IFRS 6, we have considered whether there are any indicators of impairment on the exploration and development assets. Based on our assessment, as at 30 June 2025 there were not deemed to be indicators that the licences are not commercial and that the carrying value of \u00a311,795,976 continues to be supported by ongoing development work on the licence areas with no impairments considered necessary. It is noted that increases in North Sea taxes in 2024 together with further fiscal instability created by the ongoing government consultation has increased uncertainty around the timing of potential sanction of the Buchan redevelopment project by the Joint Venture.\n8.

The weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on 1 January 2019 was 3%. The borrowing rate applied for 2025 remained at 3% and the leases relate to office space. A new lease agreement was entered into in June 2023 for a total of 9 years with break clauses after 3 and 6 years. Given the 3-year break clause and the future plans for the business it was deemed appropriate to recognise the liability relating to a 3-year period.\nAmounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income:\n30/06/25\n30/06/24\n31/12/24\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nDepreciation charge of right-of-use asset\nBuildings\n27,932\n27,932\n55,864\n27,932\n27,932\n55,864\n30/06/25\n30/06/24\n31/12/24\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nInterest expenses (included in finance cost)\nBuildings\n(968)\n(1,799)\n(3,185)\n(968)\n(1,799)\n(3,185)\n13.

The environmental consultation confirmed the need for oil and gas developments like Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") to assess the Scope 3 emissions arising from the project as part of its regulatory approval submissions. In terms of the fiscal regime, the consultation resulted in the continued application of the Energy Profits Levy (\"EPL\") in its current form until 1 April 2030, which implies a marginal tax rate of 78% for the industry. The successor regime, the Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (\"OGPM\"), replaces the EPL with a revenue-based model for calculating windfall profits, that levies a 35% tax only on the revenues generated above applicable commodity threshold prices (in addition to the corporate and supplementary tax rate of 40%).\n\u00a7\nUnder the OGPM two independent threshold price points will be set annually, one for oil (in dollars per barrel) and one for gas (in pence per therm). The thresholds in financial year 2026-27 have been set at $90/bbl for oil and 90p/therm for gas - they will be adjusted annually in line with CPI inflation and are projected to be around $98/bbl and 98p/therm by 2030. When in effect the OGPM restores the tax rate to the 40% headline rate in the permanent regime, with the OGPM only applying to oil or gas revenues in the event the respective commodity price is unusually high.\n\u00a7\nThe interplay between the EPL and OGPM regimes provides tax\npaying companies with the opportunity to continue securing a 78% tax offset (including 38% attributable to the EPL) for every pound invested between now and 2030 (or 84.25% when including the investment allowance available on the Supplementary Charge Tax), alongside the potential to generate revenue from those investing activities post 2030 with just the permanent 40% tax rate applicable so long as commodity prices remain under the OGPM threshold prices. This points to it being optimal for long term investments being undertaken between now and the end of the decade.\n\u00a7\nAlongside the changes in the regulatory and fiscal landscape, 2025 was also marked by a step change in the scale of both our Buchan joint venture partners. NEO Energy Limited, the operator for the Buchan development project, not only combined its business with the UK subsidiary of Repsol S.A., but in December 2025 it announced a subsequent merger with the UK business of TotalEnergies S.A., to create NEO Next+ (\"NEO\").\n\u00a7\nUpon completion of the NEO Next+ transaction, NEO will become the leading operator and producer in the UK North Sea, with an expected production portfolio of over 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\").\n\u00a7\nSerica Energy (\"Serica\") (AIM: SQZ) also announced a series of strategic acquisitions during the year, establishing the business as the leading mid-tier UK North Sea producer.\nGreater Buchan Area\n\u00a7\nThe major transformations that have taken place with NEO and Serica places the growth prospects that the Buchan project provides within two high-quality, UK North Sea focused asset portfolios. Access to a project with estimated gross mid case proven and probable resources of approximately 70 million barrels of oil equivalent represents a material prize at this stage of the UK North Sea lifecycle.\n\u00a7\nThere continues to be active engagement between the Buchan joint venture partners, particularly around the key strategic engineering decisions and plans for the development. Work is progressing to prepare the necessary addendum to the Buchan Environmental Impact Assessment incorporating the requirements of the updated guidance regarding the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions, as well as setting out the socio-economic benefits to the UK that the development will deliver. Value engineering work is also being completed, particula",

The subject of the consultation was the development of a permanent successor to the Energy Profits Levy (\"\nEPL\n\"), in the form of the Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (\"\nOGPM\n\").\nThe consultation response states that:\n\u00a7\nThe OGPM will come into effect either on 1 April 2030 or earlier if the existing price floors that pertain to the EPL are passed (being $74/bbl and 57p/therm in the last financial year)\n\u00a7\nThe Government has decided to adopt a revenue-based model for the calculation of windfalls under the OGPM, with a 35% tax being levied only on the revenues generated above the threshold prices\n\u00a7\nTwo independent threshold price points will be set annually, one for oil (in dollars per barrel) and one for gas (in pence per therm)\n\u00a7\nThe thresholds in financial year 2026-27 have been set at $90/bbl for oil and 90p/therm for gas - they will be adjusted annually in line with CPI inflation and are projected to be around $98/bbl and 98p/therm by 2030\n\u00a7\nThe OGPM when in effect returns the tax rate to the 40% headline rate in the permanent regime, with the OGPM only applying to oil or gas revenues in the event the respective commodity price is unusually high\nWith clarity on the longer-term tax regime now provided, the Company will be working with the Buchan joint venture partners, NEO Next Energy and Serica Energy, to assess the impact of these changes on the Buchan project.\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero. JOG holds a 20% interest in each of licences P2498 (Blocks 20/5a, 20/5e and 21/1a) and P2170 (Blocks 20/5b and 21/1d) located in the UK Central North Sea and referred to as the \"Greater Buchan Area\" (\"GBA\"). Licence P2498 contains the Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") oil field and J2 oil discovery and licence P2170 contains the Verbier oil discovery.\nJOG's strategy is focused on unlocking the organic value of its GBA assets, combined with the pursuit of potential asset acquisitions that bring cash flow, diversity and quality investment opportunities into the portfolio. The Company's Board and Executive team have a wealth of experience in managing and growing publicly listed energy companies and a strong track-record of value creation in the UK North Sea's oil and gas sector.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the usual risk factors and uncertainties associated with an oil and gas business.

The extension was requested to provide JOG and its joint venture partners with the time required to finalise the Buchan Field Development Plan\n\u00a7\nSolid financial position, with cash at the end of H1-2025 of \u00a311.3 million and the total annualised running cost of the business reduced by approximately 50% to an expected \u00a31.5 million\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"Against a challenging backdrop where the North Sea oil and gas industry has been unnecessarily damaged by the 78% EPL tax rate, we have positioned the Company to withstand the on-going fiscal and regulatory uncertainty by halving the cost base and maintaining a strong cash position.\nWe hold an interest in a potentially incredible prize in the form of our carried interest to first oil on the Buchan redevelopment project. This has the potential to unlock significant UK investment, create over 1,000 well paid jobs and ultimately realise hundreds of millions in future tax payments to the exchequer. We urge the government to complete its consultation process on the future fiscal regime and remove the EPL in order to establish a playing field that facilitates future investments. Homegrown energy should be prioritised over more carbon intensive energy imports and with Buchan, we have a great opportunity to be at the forefront of championing a fully integrated production hub that aligns with the industry's decarbonisation strategy.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero.

Despite the uncertainties that have been created within the UK oil and gas industry as a result of the Energy Profits Levy (\"EPL\") and the on-going consultations that have been launched by the Government, the Company remains well placed to execute upon its plans for long-term value creation.\nBuchan Redevelopment Project\nSignificant progress was made during 2024 to advance the Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") redevelopment project towards sanction and Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval. Despite the project slowdown resulting from the various regulatory consultations and the need to obtain sufficient clarity on the outcome of these to finalise the way forward, three major workstreams have been matured:\n\u00a7\nDetailed engagement has been on-going on the draft Buchan FDP with the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\"). In addition, the Buchan \"Field Determination Area\", that defines the maximum geological boundary of the field, was agreed with the NSTA\n\u00a7\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") for the project was issued to the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for the Environment and Decommissioning (\"OPRED\") and various activities have been completed to progress the regulatory evaluation.\n\u00a7\nFront-end engineering and design (\"FEED\") studies were completed, the results of which have been used to define the details of the development execution plan. The primary engineering studies covered the appropriate solutions for the design of the wells, the subsea infrastructure and the necessary modification and life extension works required on the planned floating, production, storage and offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel. Offshore surveys were also completed to gather the geotechnical and geophysical data required for the subsea infrastructure and drilling rig contract tendering processes and to inform the FPSO mooring design\nWith the announcements during the year of three Government consultations concerning revised guidance for EIAs, the future for UK North Sea oil and gas licensing and the future fiscal regime, the timeline for progressing the project to the point of joint venture partner sanction and FDP approval was naturally delayed. An extension to the Buchan P2498 licence was obtained from the NSTA, which means that the joint venture has until 28 February 2027 to obtain FDP approval. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of FDP approval, the agreement for the acquisition of the \"Western Isles\" FPSO for redeployment on the Buchan field was terminated in March 2025 by Dana Petroleum (\"Dana\") after the longstop date in the agreement was passed. NEO, the Buchan Operator, is a 23% owner of the vessel and the possibility remains to recontract the vessel for deployment on Buchan.\nSubject to satisfactory clarity being obtained from the Government consultations, there are clear steps that need to be completed to move the Buchan project forward to FDP approval and onward into the development execution phase of activities. These are:\n\u00a7\nReactivation and completion of the contract tender process for the main drilling, subsea and FPSO modification workscopes\n\u00a7\nRe-contracting of the FPSO\n\u00a7\nSubmission to OPRED of an updated EIA that incorporates the requirements of the guidance resulting from the on-going consultation, which is expected to principally concern the inclusion of Scope 3 emission forecasts for the project\n\u00a7\nJoint venture finalisation of the FDP and approval of the NSTA\nWhile the exact timeline for completing these activities has not yet been finalised, it is likely that a positive outcome from the consultations would lead to FDP approval being targeted during 2026.\nAs a result of the farm-out transactions with NEO and Serica, the Company is carried for its 20% share of the costs to take Buchan through to FDP approval, along with its share of the development costs included in the approved FDP. To date, the financial benefit of this has totalled approximately $25 million in cash milestone payments and expenditure carry. Further cash milestone payments of $20 million are due upon Buchan FDP approval and receipt of the associated regulatory and legal consents.\nStrategic Focus\nThe",

This extension was requested in order to provide the licensees with the time required to finalise a FDP for the Buchan field.\n\u00a7\nCompletion of the Buchan Environmental Impact Assessment (\"EIA\") approval process by the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for the Environment and Decommissioning (\"OPRED\") has naturally been paused following the Supreme Court's \"Finch\" judgment in 2024 concerning the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions in development project EIAs. The actions required to advance the Buchan EIA will be clarified once revised guidance is issued by OPRED, which is expected in spring 2025.\n\u00a7\nThe UK Government announced last year that a consultation will be held on the tax regime that will apply to the oil and gas industry after 2030. Satisfactory clarity on the results of this consultation is required to facilitate sanctioning of the Buchan project. It is anticipated that the fiscal consultation will be launched shortly.\n\u00a7\nWhile the majority of the required inspection, verification and pre-transfer work has been completed by Dana Petroleum on the Western Isles floating production, storage and offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel to satisfy the main technical requirements of the sale and purchase agreement, the agreement longstop date was reached at the end of February 2025 with work outstanding. In light of the current slowdown in Buchan project activities as a consequence of the fiscal and regulatory consultations, along with work on the vessel still requiring completion, the parties have not terminated the agreement and are in dialogue on the optimal contractual way forward to accommodate these delays. NEO Energy, the Buchan operator, remains a 23% owner of the vessel.\n\u00a7\nIn order to both accelerate potential value creation from JOG's existing UK tax allowances of over $100 million and bring cash flow into the business, a number of potential UK producing asset acquisitions are being actively evaluated.\n\u00a7\nThe total cash running cost of the business has been reduced by approximately 50% to \u00a31.5 million in 2025 as a result of actions taken by the Company following the slowdown in activities on the Buchan project. Per the terms of the farm-out agreements executed with NEO Energy and Serica Energy, the Company's 20% share of Buchan project expenditure is fully carried by our two joint venture partners.\n\u00a7\nThe Company's aggregate cash balance at the end of 2024 was approximately \u00a312.3 million. A further $20 million cash payment is payable under the terms of the Buchan farm-out agreements following approval of the FDP by the NSTA and receipt of the associated regulatory and legal consents.\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"With the Buchan licence having now been extended, the joint venture partnership has secured the necessary time to determine the appropriate path to project sanction, with JOG holding a 20% carried interest to first oil. Whilst the UK Government's fiscal and regulatory consultations are creating a somewhat uncertain backdrop for the industry at the current time, the way forward on these two key areas is scheduled to be resolved over the coming months.\"\n\"The Buchan project has the potential to create over 1,000 jobs across many parts of the UK's supply chain and over 200 project related jobs, attract private investment of around \u00a31 billion into the UK economy and generate hundreds of millions in UK tax revenues.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through",

This reflects \u00a35.5 million received during the first half of the year as a result of completing the Greater Buchan Area farm-out transaction with Serica\n\u00a7\nThe Company benefits from no financial exposure to its 20% share of the Buchan project's costs as a result of the farm-outs that have been completed with NEO and Serica\n\u00a7\nWhilst clarity is awaited on the fiscal and regulatory uncertainties currently facing the UK's oil and gas industry, work on the project is being slowed down by the Buchan Operator and a licence extension is being requested\n\u00a7\nActions are being taken to further reduce the cash costs of the business in the near term ahead of Buchan FDP approval. Through various measures, including a reduction in salaries, staff and Director numbers, the cash costs of the business are forecast to fall by 50% from \u00a33 million a year to under \u00a31.5 million in 2025\n\u00a7\nWhile the Company continues to seek compelling M&A opportunities that could bring cash flow, portfolio diversification and quality investment opportunities into the business, it is now looking through a wider lens than the historic focus on purely UK oil and gas assets\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"The first half of the year has been marked by both highs and lows for the Company. In February 2024, we celebrated completion of our second GBA farm-out transaction to Serica Energy. Critically, this enabled us to secure a fully funded 20% interest in the Buchan development project. This achievement was testament to the quality of the asset we have nurtured from inception and to the expertise and tenacity of the team.\nThe high of this farm-out success has been tempered over the course of the year by the fiscal and political turmoil the UK oil and gas industry has faced. Whilst demand for hydrocarbons continues during the energy transition, developing homegrown energy provides the UK with a cleaner and more secure solution than relying on carbon intensive imported fuels. The Buchan project has the potential to create over 1,000 jobs across many parts of the UK supply chain and over 200 project related jobs, attract private investment of around \u00a31 billion into the UK economy, generate hundreds of millions in UK tax revenues and deliver accelerated investment in new offshore renewable electricity generation.\nAgainst that backdrop, we hope that the Government will ensure that sense prevails and the right fiscal and regulatory environment is established to enable the UK's oil and gas industry to continue being a highly valuable contributor to the economy\nf\nor years to come, whilst we transition to a lower carbon economy.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nLeif Powis\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero.

The Government has determined that such guidance is necessary in light of the recent Supreme Court \"Finch\" ruling requiring regulators to consider the impact of hydrocarbon combustion, Scope 3 emissions, in the Environmental Impact Assessment for new projects. The Government is aiming to conclude its consultation by Spring 2025.\nThe press release issued by NEO noted:\n\"NEO and its 100% owner HitecVision have taken the decision to materially slow down activities across all development assets in the portfolio. In relation to the Buchan Horst project NEO awaits clarity around the UK regulatory and fiscal framework so that the full impact can be assessed. This will inevitably delay first oil timing in relation to the project, which was previously forecast to be late 2027. The Joint Venture will seek a licence extension in order to continue technical evaluation in light of these changes to tax and environmental consents\".\nAndrew Benitz, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"Whilst demand for hydrocarbons continues during the energy transition, homegrown energy is the right solution. A project like Buchan has the potential to produce some of the lowest emission barrels of any project globally. Emissions arising from the combustion or use of those hydrocarbons will result in the same emissions as comparable barrels regardless of where they are produced. Homegrown energy should always trump imports, creating domestic economic growth, jobs and valuable UK tax receipts.\"\nThe Company will issue its Interim Financial Results for the six month period ending 30 June 2024 on 19 September 2024. JOG's cash position at the end of the first half of 2024 was approximately \u00a313 million and the Company benefits from no financial exposure to Buchan project costs as a result of the farm-outs that have been completed with NEO and Serica Energy.\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nLeif Powis\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero.

While activities continue in order for the Buchan project to be ready for Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval by the end of this year, the exact timing for achieving this key milestone and enabling project sanction is naturally linked to securing fiscal clarity from the next government and ensuring that the project remains financially attractive.\nThe Buchan Operator, NEO Energy, continues to make good progress on advancing the work programme required to enable project sanction. Completion of the necessary engineering work is on track and the first offshore survey was completed in May, obtaining the geophysical data used for the subsea and drilling rig contract tendering process. A second survey to obtain geotechnical data is scheduled to commence this month. Work is also advancing on completion of the other two key remaining workstreams, being the subsurface studies required to finalise the drilling programme and operational verification and preparation for the handover of the \"Western Isles\" floating production, storage and offloading vessel (\"FPSO\") to the Buchan joint venture. Alongside these activities, engagement on the Buchan FDP and associated regulatory consents is progressing to plan with the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\") and the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for the Environment and Decommissioning.\nFollowing the receipt of fiscal clarity and subject to FDP approval, the major contract awards and capital commitments for the project are now expected in 2025, which leads to Buchan first production being targeted for late 2027. Under the current fiscal policy, the Company's valuation of the Buchan redevelopment project does not materially change as a result of the later first production date.\nJOG remains fully funded with a current cash position of over \u00a313 million and a forecast annual base cash spend of \u00a33 million. The Buchan project remains fully carried to FDP with a further $20 million payment due following approval by the NSTA of the Buchan FDP and receipt of the associated regulatory and legal consents. The Company also has a full carry to first oil for its 20% equity interest in the Buchan field development costs, which are to be approved in the FDP.\nAndrew Benitz, Chief Executive Officer, commented\n:\n\"With a UK General Election now announced, we are hopeful that fiscal clarity will be forthcoming in short order so that the industry can continue to do what it does best, namely investing in major capital projects that deliver vital low carbon homegrown energy and highly skilled jobs. In the case of the Buchan field, we have a project that will deliver a meaningful contribution to the energy transition process through our electrification strategy, which helps facilitate investment in cutting-edge floating offshore wind.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nLeif Powis\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero.

Having successfully aggregated the GBA resource base and progressed the necessary development planning activities, two farm-out transactions were executed, bringing in two credible industry partners and the funding required to monetise the area.\nSecuring the means and the finance to move the GBA project forward into the development phase of activities has been the key ambition of the Company since taking over sole ownership of the licence area in 2021. The farm-out transactions with NEO Energy (\"NEO\") and Serica Energy (\"Serica\") do just that and have transformed the outlook for the business.\nBy bringing in leading industry partners, closing out the selection of the GBA development solution and securing a high-quality floating production, storage and offloading vessel (\"FPSO\"), the Company has set the path to delivering a material long-term income stream from the Buchan redevelopment project. Importantly, the structure of the farm-out transactions ensures that the Company has secured a series of cash payments, which comfortably finance the on-going operations of the business, as well as funding for its remaining 20% interest in the Buchan project.\nBuchan - Moving Forward\nThe Buchan redevelopment project continues to make good progress. Completion of the necessary pre-sanction Front-End Engineering and Design work is on track and the first offshore survey vessel mobilisation occurred earlier this month to obtain the geophysical and geotechnical data required to finalise the subsea and drilling rig contract tendering process and inform the FPSO mooring design.\nIn line with the strategy for the future connection of the FPSO to one of the anticipated floating wind power developments in the area, engagement is on-going with the companies that were awarded acreage in the INTOG licencing round conducted by Crown Estate Scotland in 2023. Securing a source of green power feeds into the post start-up electrification plan for the FPSO and does not defer the target date for first oil.\nThe draft Buchan Field Development Plan was submitted to the North Sea Transition Authority in December 2023 and the Environmental Statement was submitted to the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for the Environment and Decommissioning at the beginning of 2024. Subject to project sanction from the joint venture partners, these submissions pave the way for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for the Buchan redevelopment project in the second half of 2024.\nThe UK oil and gas industry as a whole is currently being frustrated in its efforts to maximise the production of homegrown resources by fiscal uncertainty. Through the work of the industry trade body, Offshore Energies UK, a significant amount of effort is going into engaging with the leaders of all parties to make sure the benefits of domestic energy production are understood and realised.\nSolid Outlook\nThe Company's vision is centred on successfully growing the business in a smart and sustainable way. The business is focused on unlocking the organic value of its existing GBA assets, combined with the pursuit of accretive asset acquisitions that bring cash flow, diversity and quality investment opportunities into the portfolio. Such opportunities are thoroughly assessed in terms of their potential strategic fit, being mindful of the quality and unencumbered strengths of our existing portfolio.\nThe Company is well positioned to deliver on its strategic objectives. With a cash balance following completion of the Serica farm-out in late February 2024 of over \u00a315 million, the business is financially secure and funded for the planned Buchan redevelopment programme.

We delivered on our key strategic objectives - completing the GBA farm-out process and securing a fully funded, material 20% position in the Buchan redevelopment. Our partners, NEO Energy and Serica Energy, are hugely competent UK North Sea operators and we are delighted to be working alongside them on taking the Buchan project forward. With the draft Field Development Plan now submitted, we are well on the way to obtaining regulatory approval later this year and achieving the target of first production in late 2026. As a result of the 2023 transactions, JOG's value and investment proposition has been transformed. The value of the business is firmly underpinned, with the planned FPSO development solution delivering robust economics and providing the route to full monetisation of the GBA portfolio.\"\nCorporate Presentation\nThe updated corporate presentation can be accessed on the Company's website at the following location:\nhttps://www.jerseyoilandgas.com/investors/presentations/\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nLeif Powis\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas is a UK E&P company focused on building an upstream oil and gas business in the North Sea.

Upon completion of the Serica Farm-out, JOG will have a 20% interest in the GBA licences\nand a full carry on the capital expenditure required to bring the Buchan field into production.\nHighlights\n:\n\u00a7\nFully Funded\n: The transaction delivers material value to JOG and results in the Company having a fully funded 20% interest in the on-going Buchan redevelopment project\n\u00a7\nStrong industry partner\n: Serica is a leading mid-tier UK oil and gas company producing more than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, further strengthening the quality of the GBA joint venture\n\u00a7\nMilestone payments\n: $18 million of the $38 million cash payments attributable to the two GBA farm-outs will have been received upon completion of the Serica transaction\n\u00a7\nValue creation\n: Clear path to development sanction and first oil, with JOG's fully funded position meaning the Company is underpinned by exposure to zero-capex flowing barrels\n\u00a7\nFuture cash generation\n: Once onstream, JOG will be a non-operated partner entitled to 20% of production from the Buchan field\n\u00a7\nLow carbon development\n: redeployment of an existing floating production, storage and offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel that is planned for future connection to a nearby floating wind power development makes the Buchan redevelopment solution the option with the lowest full-cycle carbon footprint\nTransaction Summary\nThe farm-out transaction with Serica is on identical pro-rata terms to that previously completed with NEO Energy (\"NEO\") earlier in the year. In aggregate, the two transactions result in JOG retaining a\n20% interest in the GBA licences,\na full carry on the capital expenditure required to bring the Buchan field into production and a number of milestone cash payments. Upon completion of the Serica Farm-out, the combined cash payments received from the two farm-outs will be over $18 million, with a further $20 million due to be paid to JOG at Buchan Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval.\nIn exchange for entering into definitive agreements to divest a 30% working interest in the GBA licences, the Company is set to receive from Serica:\n\u00a7\n7.5% carry of the estimated $25 million cost to take the Buchan field through to FDP approval\n\u00a7\n7.5% carry of the Buchan field development costs, up to the budget included in the approved FDP; equivalent to a 1.25 carry ratio\n\u00a7\n$6.8 million cash payment on completion, which includes a $5.6 million payment associated with the finalisation of the GBA development solution and associated acquisition of the \"Western Isles\" FPSO\n\u00a7\n$7.5 million cash payment on approval of the Buchan FDP by the NSTA\n\u00a7\n$3 million cash payments on each FDP approval by the NSTA in respect of the J2 and Verbier oil discoveries\nThe primary condition precedent to completing the Serica Farm-out is receipt of approval from the NSTA for the transaction.\nBuchan Development Plan\nFollowing the recent announcement regarding the acquisition of the \"Western Isles\" FPSO, all the main components of the Buchan redevelopment plan have now been defined. The field is to be produced through the use of up to five subsea production wells, supported by two water injection wells. These will be tied back to the FPSO, which will be modified to be \"electrification-ready\" prior to redeployment to the field. This will enable the vessel to have the potential to be connected to one of the anticipated third-party floating wind power developments that are intended to be located in close proximity to the GBA following the recent Innovation and Targeted Oil & Gas (\"INTOG\") licence awards made by Crown Estate Scotland.\nWork is progressing on the Front End Engineering and Design (\"FEED\") studies that require completion ahead of FDP approval and the development moving into the execution phase of activities. The total capital expenditure forecast for the Buchan redevelopment is estimated by the Operator, NEO, to be approximately \u00a3850-950 million (gross cost) to bring into production over 70 million barrels of oil equivalent (95% oil), with peak production rates of approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This estimate will be refined as part of completing FEED and the contract tendering activities that precede finalisation of the FDP. As a result of the farm-out transactions, the Company's share of the capital expenditure included in the approved FDP work programme and budget will be fully carried by NEO and Serica. The transactions unlock the route to monetising total estimated GBA resources in excess of",

The FPSO will be used as the processing facility for the planned redevelopment of the Buchan field.\nHighlights\n:\n\u00a7\nWestern Isles FPSO, which has been operational since 2017, acquired for planned redevelopment of the Buchan field - high-quality vessel that is currently operating in the UK North Sea\n\u00a7\nJOG to receive a $9.4 million cash payment from NEO pursuant to the terms of the farm-out transaction announced on 6 April 2023 - the milestone payment in respect of finalisation of the Greater Buchan Area (\"GBA\") development solution\n\u00a7\nWork progressing at pace on Front-End Engineering and Design (\"FEED\") activities in order to facilitate Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval in 2024\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"Finalising the terms for the joint venture partners to acquire the FPSO, which is less than eight years old and requires relatively modest adaptation for our planned GBA redevelopment, is a tremendous milestone for the project.\n\"Re-using existing high-quality infrastructure and modifying it to be electrification-ready is exactly in line with our stated low carbon strategy and the net zero related objectives of the industry. The vessel is the cornerstone to completing the engineering work required to facilitate FDP approval for the Buchan redevelopment next year.\"\nGBA Development Solution\nIn July 2023, it was announced that the preferred solution for the redevelopment of the Greater Buchan Area (\"GBA\") was via the redeployment of an FPSO. This solution benefits from being both the lowest cost development option and the one that results in the lowest full-cycle carbon footprint of all the potential options evaluated. This conclusion was driven by the ability to re-use existing infrastructure that can be located directly at the Buchan field and, with limited modifications, make the FPSO \"electrification-ready\" upon its redeployment. This will enable the vessel to have the potential to be connected to one of the anticipated third-party floating wind power developments that are intended to be located in close proximity to the GBA following the recent Innovation and Targeted Oil & Gas (\"INTOG\") licence awards made by Crown Estate Scotland.\nImportantly, the preferred development solution aligns with the North Sea Transition Authority's (\"NSTA\") obligations to maximise the economic recovery of reserves and assist with achieving the UK government's net zero target. Consequently, the NSTA issued a letter confirming it had no objections to the Concept Select Report submitted in support of the Buchan re-development programme utilising the redeployment of the Western Isles FPSO.\nFPSO Acquisition\nThe Western Isles FPSO that is being acquired by NEO on behalf of the Buchan field partners is currently operating in the UK North Sea and is owned by Dana Petroleum (E&P) Limited (76.9188%), as operator, and NEO (23.0812%). The FPSO is a high-quality vessel that has been in operation since early 2017 and is scheduled to come off-station as part of the planned cessation of production of the Western Isles fields around the second half of 2024. The operational capabilities of the vessel, along with its relatively limited service-life to date, make the FPSO an excellent fit for use on the planned redevelopment of the Buchan field.\nFollowing handover of the vessel to NEO, as the Buchan field operator, it is planned for a relatively modest work programme to be undertaken in order to prepare the FPSO for redeployment on Buchan. The works will essentially involve the installation of water injection booster pumps, produced water injection modifications and preparation of the vessel for future electrification. These modifications are expected to be completed by early 2026, such that the vessel can be deployed to the field location and hooked up ready for the anticipated start-up of production in late 2026.\nAgreements have been executed to acquire the 76.9188% interest in the vessel not currently owned by NEO. The main terms of the acquisition commit the Buchan field partners to acquire the vessel upon the approval of the Buchan FDP. Prior to this milestone being achieved, the Buchan partners are responsible for the costs of storing the vessel from the date of handover, which is anticipated to be in the second half of 2024. The FPSO acquisition and associated costs forms part of the previously announced farm-out carry arrangements agreed between NEO and JOG.\nNEO Farm-out Transaction\nAs a res",

This solution benefits from being both the lowest cost development option and the one that results in the lowest full-cycle carbon footprint of all the potential options evaluated. This is driven by the ability to re-use existing infrastructure that can be located directly at the Buchan field and, with limited modifications, make the FPSO \"electrification-ready\" upon its redeployment. This will enable the vessel to have the potential to be connected to one of the anticipated floating wind power developments that are intended to be located in close proximity to the GBA following the recent Innovation and Targeted Oil & Gas (\"INTOG\") licence awards made by Crown Estate Scotland.\nThe preferred development solution aligns with the NSTA's obligations to maximise the economic recovery of reserves and assist with achieving the UK government's net zero target. The NSTA has issued a letter confirming it has no objections to the Concept Select Report submitted to support the Buchan re-development programme.\nWith the GBA development solution now identified, work is progressing on the engineering studies that are required prior to submission of the development plan in 2024. The Company estimates that the total capital expenditure for the Buchan field re-development, including the cost of acquiring the FPSO, will be in the region of $900 million (gross cost). This estimate will be assessed and refined with NEO as part of completing the Front End Engineering and Design and contract tendering activities that precede Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") finalisation.\nFollowing the recently completed farm-out transaction with NEO, the Company has a 50% working interest in the GBA licences. Through the expenditure carry arrangements agreed with NEO, JOG will be carried for 12.5% of the Buchan field re-development costs (equivalent to a 1.25 carry ratio). In line with JOG's stated strategy to farm-out a further interest in the GBA licences, it is targeted for the Company to ultimately retain a fully carried 20-25% interest in the Buchan re-development.\nFurther information on the core components of the development programme and execution schedule will be provided as the work progresses. The Company is also planning to commission an independent reserves evaluation as part of its end of year financial reporting process.\nProposed FPSO Acquisition\nIn tandem with the specification of the preferred development solution, the GBA partners have agreed the key commercial terms for the proposed acquisition of an existing FPSO. The proposed acquisition is conditional on the negotiation and execution of relevant transaction agreements, including a sale and purchase agreement. The acquisition would form part of the carry arrangements agreed between NEO and JOG.\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to have finalised the GBA development solution and agreed key commercial terms for securing an FPSO for redeployment on the Buchan field. This marks a major step forward for the project, not least by providing the GBA partners with a solution that minimises the overall carbon footprint of the project and provides the opportunity to be an early participant in the UK oil and gas industry's offshore electrification plans. We look forward to working closely with NEO, as the incoming operator of the GBA licences, on preparing the overall Buchan field re-development plan that is anticipated to be submitted to the NSTA during the first half of 2024.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nC/o Camarco: 020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nfinnCap Ltd\nChristopher Raggett\nTim Redfern\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nFarm-Out Transaction Summary\n:\nIn exchange for entering into definitive agreements to divest a 50% w",

Following completion of the transaction, operatorship of the licences will transfer to NEO.\nThe Company will be working in partnership with NEO to select the preferred development solution, having confirmed a short list of attractive options for the GBA which utilise existing North Sea infrastructure. The unstable fiscal conditions resulting from the introduction and revision of the Energy Profits Levy during 2022 have been challenging. As the joint venture moves forward towards first oil, which is targeted for 2026, it will be mindful of the future fiscal attractiveness of the UK.\nThe Company intends to farm-out additional equity in the GBA licences in order to ultimately retain a 20-25% carried interest in the development following FDP approval. NEO has an option to increase its 50% interest in the Buchan licence by up to an additional 37.5% in exchange for a further cash payment should any of JOG's equity share in the development remain unfunded ahead of FDP submission,\nwith such payment being the pro-rated balance of future cash payments due to JOG post completion in relation to the GBA development solution and Buchan FDP as outlined above.\nJOG remains well funded for its on-going and planned work programmes, with a cash balance of approximately \u00a36.5 million as at 31 December 2022. It is intended that the cash payments anticipated to be received from NEO following completion of the transaction will be utilised to pursue the Company's stated growth strategy and provide additional working capital for the Company.\nThe Company intends to issue its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2022 in the second half of May 2023.\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"We are delighted to announce this transaction with NEO Energy, a well-funded industry heavyweight and the fifth largest producer in the UKCS. The farm-out marks a major value creation moment for JOG, a significant de-risking of the GBA development programme, from both an operational and funding perspective, and provides the springboard from which to grow the long-term value of the business. We are looking forward to working collaboratively with NEO Energy to select the optimal development solution for the GBA and taking the project through to sanction and on into future production.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz, CEO\nC/o Camarco:\nTel: 020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus",

Between Hunt and Reeves, the EPL was transformed from a short-term windfall tax into a confusing, unfair, and burdensome levy that has threatened the entire existence of the North Sea oil and gas industry. Having assisted in that process, Treasury has designed an elegant exit that will incentivise near term investment in projects, and provide fiscal clarity on the future tax regime while preserving a genuine and fair windfall tax. You would not think that if you read the newspapers, rather than the Treasury's consultation response, but 'tis the case. Starting with the future fiscal environment. From 2Q 2030 the EPL is no more, it is replaced by the OGPM and any allowances that might offset EPL have no value past that date, but the 38% levy on top of the \"permanent tax regime\" is gone. The \"permanent tax regime\" is the combination of a 30% corporation tax and a 10% supplementary charge; this regime has never been stable but we are all accustomed to it and everyone in the industry understands how it works, Unlike the renewable power industry, the oil and gas industry expects to pay higher taxes and is unaccustomed to guaranteed prices and other government subsidies. The replacement tax only applies to revenue in excess of a threshold price for the product. The thresholds are close to the actual real historic average prices for our products: $90/bbl for oil and 90p/therm for gas. The OGPM is a 35% revenue tax that only applies to the price over the threshold so if the price for oil is $120/bbl producers pay 35% of $30/bbl, as opposed to 38% of $120/bbl in today's system. This makes sense, bankers and boards take decisions to develop new fields with conservative assumptions about oil and gas prices. The existing and poorly named Energy Security Investment Mechanism guarantees that investment decision makers combine low product prices with a greedy fiscal take. So, the industry has been paralyzed, temper tantrums ensue and despair grips the industry. We can all wake up, the nightmare is over, it is time to get to work on planning projects, and with the rules established, work out how to make the best of the situation we find ourselves in. For companies that are currently producing, and paying EPL, the message is clear - start projects and spend money between now and the end of EPL. Every pound spent on development and exploration projects reduces those companies' tax bill by 38% without an offsetting uplift to their tax bills when those projects start production. Producers have the opportunity to execute projects for nearly 40% off, if they sanction them now. That message hasn't got through to all the players just yet, but it so",

We are very upbeat about the prospects for a renewed wave of North Sea investment. Orcadian's strategy has always been to build a portfolio of carried interests in projects that can deliver a legacy for our investors and shareholders and while we are disappointed that new licences are limited to the Transitional Energy Certificates, which we believe will enable access to the Feugh discovery in support of Pilot, we would not be surprised if a future government reversed this policy as quickly as the New Zealand government has done. Orcadian has five licences with three appraised development projects (Pilot, Earlham and Lowlander), two appraisal targets (Elke and Fynn Beauly), three gas exploration prospects (Clover, Glenlough and Breckagh) and the potential redevelopment of Orwell. From the industry's perspective the hiatus in licence awards chokes off the supply of new project opportunities. From Orcadian's perspective, we have multiple opportunities for investment at a time when the producing companies paying EPL need good investment opportunities and have limited means to access new opportunities from the NSTA...... We believe the UK North Sea is on the verge of a resurgence and that Orcadian is well positioned to make the best of it.",

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

He sees the damage Net Zero is doing and is fully on the case. Hopefully we don't have to wait till Holyrood elections in May for the utter destruction being caused to the Economy to end, but expect a lot of back peddling and real weasel words from the parties over the coming months trying to justify their destruction of Aberdeen and all things Oil and Gas. We knew they were pretty useless individuals, but for Starmer (the Ring Master), not to understand his own policy is quite breath taking Quote \"Over 1,000 jobs a month are being lost in North Sea oil and gas thanks to his government\u2019s policies yet Keir Starmer doesn\u2019t have even a basic understanding of his 78% windfall profits tax. He tells STV it only kicks in above a certain level of profit. Wrong. It applies without a minimum profit level or market-based trigger. Unlike a proper windfall tax (one tied to sudden price spikes), it has no deactivation mechanism if prices or profits fall below a certain point. Pre-election Labour cited $95 a barrel as a windfall level. The current price is $64. But the windfall tax still applies at the full rate, even on reduced profits. So investment is drying up and job losses are mounting. (Most recently 400+ at ExxonMobil\u2019s Mossmorran plant and 100 at Harbour Energy). Given the misery he\u2019s causing you\u2019d think he might bother to understand exactly how his tax operates\".",

In conclusion it thinks the EPL has been more successful in prompting mergers than increasing tax receipts!

I know others, particularly Dick, have brought up JOG's tax credits before but in this climate of mergers & with these tax losses JOG could be very attractive to another north sea oil and gas driller looking to offset the EPL before it's replaced.

His final summary on what he and other directors look out for when considering future investments is also positive for their shareholders.  The JOG directors also have decent skin in the company, although they do not appear very transparent regarding their own shareholders.

Also, stating JOG is a good buy at this price when the reason it rose from around 50p is due mainly to hope the EPL would be cut short is IMO just a poor attempt at a ramp. The more likely scenario, playing out as predicted, is a dead cat bounce followed over the next 5 or 6 weeks by sustained sell off, albeit slowly with some micro rcoveries. But ultimately down. Anywhere from 50 to 80p is probable by year end. Technically oversold at 100p yesterday was followed predictably by some trading for 10-15%. Today begins the downtrend in earnest. Interesting that the term 'idiot' was levelled at me when I came with a realistic opinion. Essentially an opinion that is not a ramp is classed as idiocy? Is it still idocy when the SP is now 106p. Id say not. Im expecting 80p fairly soon. But always scope for some slightly above or below. What seems very clear is it wont hold the 100p line very long. Investors have far too much faith in the market to be rational. In this instance rationality is dropping underperformers at end of year. Others certainly will as the Christmas period approaches. Much downward pressure on the offer will ensue. Same in all AIM underperformers. We'll just have to wait and see. But holding this stock will hurt over the next 3-6 months IMO. Maybe in 2028 it will look more attractive' ... The proof is in the pudding, James.",

But... its not at present and there is no reason beyond hopium to hold these while most traders just sell them off. All my previous points remain unchallenged but the playbook is playing out in line with predictions.  And as stock predictions go I dont think this was a tough one. Anyway.  When its finally bottomed out it will still be there to pick up and that may be late 2026 or early-mid 2027 when there is more clarity. In all honesty I see JOG bottoming out around 20-30p, purely through sentiment, stagnation and no significant drivers.  It will bob up and down for traders but gains will be 5-10% runs after being pushed around by market forces and MMs and the occasional light on the horizon. But as an investment? Nope.  Not yet. Not even nearly.  Come back at 20p and chat then for a bottom drawer 2-3yr hold.  AIM has no tolerance for these long uncertain plays.  If it aint tomorrow it aint happening. Thats the mentality.  Have to work with that in these types of stock. For now it gets sold down.  Hard to predict where it stops but 50p quite possible in nearterm.  My opinion.",

The Oil Companies and Tanker Drivers have the ability (should they wish) to end this nonsense. Shut down for a couple of weeks completely and watch the repurcussions - the fuel strikes nearly did for Tony Blair. As for JOG, it's all in the hands of NEO, but we should expect some sort of direction from Our Board as to their expectations and timelines (if only for decisions being made). I would also suspect that the NTSA or whatever they are called this week shouldn't tolerate this inertia - if I've got time, I'll email them to ask in general their views, policy on this Licence, the Arrangements and what (if anything) they have/ are/ going to do about it. As to our Board, the reality for the last year is that nothing has happened. Nothing. Big Salaries are getting paid for what is in effect a Dormant Company. This can't/ shouldn't go on. I suspect they will be busy (who knows apart from them), but from a shareholders point of view, we are paying an awful lot of money to people to sit and wait for the phone to ring from NEO. Year end is a good time to address this from the Board and I would hope for meaningful action or reaction from them regarding 2025 and more importantly 2026. We all appreciate there is a limited amount they can do, but the running costs are something they can act on and, from my point of view, must do...even if it is deferring payments until the project goes forward. 2025 has been awful for JOG holders and at the moment there is no sign of this improving in 2026. Action is needed on running costs. Direction is needed (even if it's timelines) for investment decisions). The Board can surely act and update on these points. The NSTA? - well I will try (but don't hold your breath). Ever hopeful.",

We have four Directors earning probably in excess of a million a year. Why 4? To make the numbers up for a game of cards? A table Tennis competition? I think we could lose a couple and put some money towards Buckaroo or Kerrplunnk to pass the time...maybe go mad and buy Scalextrix? The fact that we have a fairly good cash position is no reason to burn it. Lets look for some value for money. I really don't doubt the Directors are really capable folk, but from my perspective, absolutely nothing has happened with JOG in 2025 (wherever the cause lies), so the year end report card is 0/10 I'm afraid.",

I have just watched a presentation they made to deliver the news.  My attention was drawn to a map of the North Sea, which highlighted all the projects SQZ are involved in, including \"Buchan Horst\" and I thought JOG holders may be interest to hear a comment Cox made: \" AS you can see from this updated map, assuming we complete on all the deals we have announced, and by the way there is no reason to think that we won't, we will have assets across all basins of the UK continental shelf with the exception of the east Irish Sea from the west of shetland.\" For me this is the clearest sign that my JOG investment, will one day come good. Cox also commented on his disappointment that the EPL is to continue, also saying that the new formula to replace the EPL clearly demonstrates that there is no windfall warranting the industry to be taxed at 78%.",

Between Hunt and Reeves, the EPL was transformed from a short-term windfall tax into a confusing, unfair, and burdensome levy that has threatened the entire existence of the North Sea oil and gas industry. Having assisted in that process, Treasury has designed an elegant exit that will incentivise near term investment in projects, and provide fiscal clarity on the future tax regime while preserving a genuine and fair windfall tax. You would not think that if you read the newspapers, rather than the Treasury's consultation response, but 'tis the case. Starting with the future fiscal environment. From 2Q 2030 the EPL is no more, it is replaced by the OGPM and any allowances that might offset EPL have no value past that date, but the 38% levy on top of the \"permanent tax regime\" is gone. The \"permanent tax regime\" is the combination of a 30% corporation tax and a 10% supplementary charge; this regime has never been stable but we are all accustomed to it and everyone in the industry understands how it works, Unlike the renewable power industry, the oil and gas industry expects to pay higher taxes and is unaccustomed to guaranteed prices and other government subsidies. The replacement tax only applies to revenue in excess of a threshold price for the product. The thresholds are close to the actual real historic average prices for our products: $90/bbl for oil and 90p/therm for gas. The OGPM is a 35% revenue tax that only applies to the price over the threshold so if the price for oil is $120/bbl producers pay 35% of $30/bbl, as opposed to 38% of $120/bbl in today's system. This makes sense, bankers and boards take decisions to develop new fields with conservative assumptions about oil and gas prices. The existing and poorly named Energy Security Investment Mechanism guarantees that investment decision makers combine low product prices with a greedy fiscal take. So, the industry has been paralyzed, temper tantrums ensue and despair grips the industry. We can all wake up, the nightmare is over, it is time to get to work on planning projects, and with the rules established, work out how to make the best of the situation we find ourselves in. For companies that are currently producing, and paying EPL, the message is clear - start projects and spend money between now and the end of EPL. Every pound spent on development and exploration projects reduces those companies' tax bill by 38% without an offsetting uplift to their tax bills when those projects start production. Producers have the opportunity to execute projects for nearly 40% off, if they sanction them now. That message hasn't got through to all the players just yet, but it so",

We are very upbeat about the prospects for a renewed wave of North Sea investment. Orcadian's strategy has always been to build a portfolio of carried interests in projects that can deliver a legacy for our investors and shareholders and while we are disappointed that new licences are limited to the Transitional Energy Certificates, which we believe will enable access to the Feugh discovery in support of Pilot, we would not be surprised if a future government reversed this policy as quickly as the New Zealand government has done. Orcadian has five licences with three appraised development projects (Pilot, Earlham and Lowlander), two appraisal targets (Elke and Fynn Beauly), three gas exploration prospects (Clover, Glenlough and Breckagh) and the potential redevelopment of Orwell. From the industry's perspective the hiatus in licence awards chokes off the supply of new project opportunities. From Orcadian's perspective, we have multiple opportunities for investment at a time when the producing companies paying EPL need good investment opportunities and have limited means to access new opportunities from the NSTA...... We believe the UK North Sea is on the verge of a resurgence and that Orcadian is well positioned to make the best of it.",

UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

Take windmills: those used in the UK (and EU) are mainly manufactured by Siemens, Vesta (the world leader) and GE. China is world leader in wind power generation and by early 2025 it had more than 50% of the world total offshore!

You are of course correct they could be working on something - they have said so in many RNS for some years (even a wind farm thing if my memory is correct). Nothing has come to fruition. We have four Directors earning probably in excess of a million a year. Why 4? To make the numbers up for a game of cards? A table Tennis competition? I think we could lose a couple and put some money towards Buckaroo or Kerrplunnk to pass the time...maybe go mad and buy Scalextrix? The fact that we have a fairly good cash position is no reason to burn it. Lets look for some value for money. I really don't doubt the Directors are really capable folk, but from my perspective, absolutely nothing has happened with JOG in 2025 (wherever the cause lies), so the year end report card is 0/10 I'm afraid.",

I have just watched a presentation they made to deliver the news.  My attention was drawn to a map of the North Sea, which highlighted all the projects SQZ are involved in, including \"Buchan Horst\" and I thought JOG holders may be interest to hear a comment Cox made: \" AS you can see from this updated map, assuming we complete on all the deals we have announced, and by the way there is no reason to think that we won't, we will have assets across all basins of the UK continental shelf with the exception of the east Irish Sea from the west of shetland.\" For me this is the clearest sign that my JOG investment, will one day come good. Cox also commented on his disappointment that the EPL is to continue, also saying that the new formula to replace the EPL clearly demonstrates that there is no windfall warranting the industry to be taxed at 78%.",

Between Hunt and Reeves, the EPL was transformed from a short-term windfall tax into a confusing, unfair, and burdensome levy that has threatened the entire existence of the North Sea oil and gas industry. Having assisted in that process, Treasury has designed an elegant exit that will incentivise near term investment in projects, and provide fiscal clarity on the future tax regime while preserving a genuine and fair windfall tax. You would not think that if you read the newspapers, rather than the Treasury's consultation response, but 'tis the case. Starting with the future fiscal environment. From 2Q 2030 the EPL is no more, it is replaced by the OGPM and any allowances that might offset EPL have no value past that date, but the 38% levy on top of the \"permanent tax regime\" is gone. The \"permanent tax regime\" is the combination of a 30% corporation tax and a 10% supplementary charge; this regime has never been stable but we are all accustomed to it and everyone in the industry understands how it works, Unlike the renewable power industry, the oil and gas industry expects to pay higher taxes and is unaccustomed to guaranteed prices and other government subsidies. The replacement tax only applies to revenue in excess of a threshold price for the product. The thresholds are close to the actual real historic average prices for our products: $90/bbl for oil and 90p/therm for gas. The OGPM is a 35% revenue tax that only applies to the price over the threshold so if the price for oil is $120/bbl producers pay 35% of $30/bbl, as opposed to 38% of $120/bbl in today's system. This makes sense, bankers and boards take decisions to develop new fields with conservative assumptions about oil and gas prices. The existing and poorly named Energy Security Investment Mechanism guarantees that investment decision makers combine low product prices with a greedy fiscal take. So, the industry has been paralyzed, temper tantrums ensue and despair grips the industry. We can all wake up, the nightmare is over, it is time to get to work on planning projects, and with the rules established, work out how to make the best of the situation we find ourselves in. For companies that are currently producing, and paying EPL, the message is clear - start projects and spend money between now and the end of EPL. Every pound spent on development and exploration projects reduces those companies' tax bill by 38% without an offsetting uplift to their tax bills when those projects start production. Producers have the opportunity to execute projects for nearly 40% off, if they sanction them now. That message hasn't got through to all the players just yet, but it so",

We are very upbeat about the prospects for a renewed wave of North Sea investment. Orcadian's strategy has always been to build a portfolio of carried interests in projects that can deliver a legacy for our investors and shareholders and while we are disappointed that new licences are limited to the Transitional Energy Certificates, which we believe will enable access to the Feugh discovery in support of Pilot, we would not be surprised if a future government reversed this policy as quickly as the New Zealand government has done. Orcadian has five licences with three appraised development projects (Pilot, Earlham and Lowlander), two appraisal targets (Elke and Fynn Beauly), three gas exploration prospects (Clover, Glenlough and Breckagh) and the potential redevelopment of Orwell. From the industry's perspective the hiatus in licence awards chokes off the supply of new project opportunities. From Orcadian's perspective, we have multiple opportunities for investment at a time when the producing companies paying EPL need good investment opportunities and have limited means to access new opportunities from the NSTA...... We believe the UK North Sea is on the verge of a resurgence and that Orcadian is well positioned to make the best of it.",

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

So if you sell for $105 you pay 40% on the first $90 and 75% only on the remaining $15 not 75% on the whole $105. So very analagous to income tax and, it seems to me, a very workable and satisfactory outcome. Additionally if the existing EPL stays in effect until 2030 and you have a large capex project to do, surely it makes sense to do it sooner rather than later to gain the benefit of offsetting against the 78% rate.",

          "content": "From Chatgpt: given the two announcements i.e. epl to stay to 2030 and EPL to be replaced with OGPM, surely the second one is more positive than the first is negative, so is it illogical that JOG's share price is far below what it was before the Budget? ChatGPT said: Thought for 6s You\u2019re thinking about it very logically in NPV terms \u2013 and I agree with your direction-of-travel: for a long-life field like Buchan, \u201cEPL stays to 2030\u201d is a negative, but \u201cwe now know it\u2019s basically 40% + occasional OGPM after 2030\u201d is a big positive. So why is the market behaving \u201cillogically\u201d (JOG below pre-Budget)? A few things are going on at once: 1. The market wasn\u2019t thinking in pure long-term NPV Before the Budget, a lot of short-term money in JOG was clearly hoping for something better than we got, for example: EPL cut early or softened, or A stronger sector \u201csignal\u201d that would re-rate UK oil equities generally. What we actually got was: Bad headline: \u201cEPL stays until 2030.\u201d Good nuance: \u201cAfter 2030, OGPM \u21d2 40% base tax most of the time, extra only when prices very high.\u201d Most traders never get to the second line. They just see: \u201cWindfall tax still there \u2192 North Sea still toxic.\u201d So there\u2019s a classic sentiment vs DCF mismatch: In spreadsheet land: \u201cBuchan\u2019s long-run economics improved; NPV up.\u201d In trading land: \u201cWindfall tax still there; sell UK oil.\u201d 2. EPS / cash-flow timing vs distant out-years Even at the project level: The EPL to 2030 hits the early, cash-rich years of production. The OGPM clarity helps the 2030s\u20132040s. Equity markets heavily discount distant cash flows and care a lot about: Near-term free cash flow, When/if a project is sanctioned, How much equity needs to be raised, etc. So even if, over 20\u201325 years, OGPM\u2019s positive effect is bigger than the extra drag of keeping EPL to 2030, the market\u2019s weight on \u201cnow to 2030\u201d is much higher than your spreadsheet\u2019s. In other words: yes, the second announcement is more positive in a 20-year NPV sense, but the first one hurts the near-term story \u2013 and that\u2019s what most holders trade on. 3. Risk, not just NPV, has gone up in some investors\u2019 minds Some investors will also read the package as: \u201cUK government has reaffirmed it\u2019s happy to slam the sector with ad-hoc taxes (EPL), even while designing OGPM.\u201d That can easily increase perceived: Political risk (what if they tinker with OGPM later?), IHT/ESG risk, And the chance that big partners still walk away or stall. Higher risk \u2192 higher discount rate \u2192 lower equity value, even if you hold the same central NPV. 4. Micro stuff: AIM sentiment, positioning, and \u201csell the news\u201d JOG is: Tiny, On AIM, Illiquid, Heavily held by PIs who were explicitly punting \u201cBudget \u2192 re-rating.\u201d In that setup: If the Budget isn\u2019t a clear \u201cwin\u201d, those holders",

A few decent-sized sells can drive the price down 10\u201320% with no fundamental news at all. So from the tape\u2019s point of view, you\u2019re seeing: Crowded, hope-driven trade pre-Budget \u2192 \u201cNot as good as we hoped\u201d headline \u2192 De-risking / stop-losses / MMs marking down Rather than a considered reassessment of 2040s cash flows. 5. Is it actually illogical? If you were valuing JOG strictly on: Buchan P50 resource, A $60\u201365 long-term deck, Full carry to first oil, and 40% tax in most post-2030 years, then yes: you\u2019d probably conclude NPV is higher now than under the pre-announcement \u201c78% forever?\u201d fog, and a share price below pre-Budget levels looks \u201ctoo low\u201d. But the market is also baking in: Fear that NEO/Serica might still not sanction (FPSO gone, capex inflation, politics). The fact EPL still makes early-year returns worse. General UKCS de-rating as big names exit and policy risk stays ugly. Pure flow/positioning \u2013 people had a trade on, it didn\u2019t work, they\u2019re out. So I\u2019d say: It\u2019s not \u201cillogical\u201d in the sense that the market is crazy; it\u2019s that the market is focusing on near-term risk and sentiment, while your intuition is focusing on long-term project NPV. Those two lenses can (and often do) give very different answers, especially in a small AIM name right after a political event.",

Harbour Energy has already reduced its onshore workforce by about 600 since 2023. The company, which has a base in Kingswells, Aberdeen, said the latest review was needed to ensure it remained competitive and was accelerated by the UK government's retention of the windfall tax. The UK government said it would do everything to support the workers and communities affected. More stories from North East Scotland, Orkney and Shetland Listen to news from North East Scotland on BBC Sounds Harbour Energy said a reduction of \"approximately 100 offshore roles\" was expected following a consultation period, which is now under way. It added the decision reflected lower anticipated production and investment in the UK sector. The company has been a vocal critic of the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), known as the windfall tax, introduced by the Conservative UK government in 2022 and extended after Labour came to power last year.

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

The recent update has not supported the price. For those of us who have held for many years, it has been money locked in and most of us are likely sitting on losses. Both current and previous governments have caused great uncertainty and their own ideologies and fear of losing their privileged positions, rather than economic benefits to the UK and domestic sustainability, has meant that O&G investors are sitting on their hands in the NS and prioritising extraction elsewhere. It would be good to hear what NEO+ has to say as the major operator.  How high a priority is Buchan in their plans? Exactly what time schedule are we looking at for FDP approval and FID. How dependent is it on any adjustment to the tax issue? I imagine that JOG Board is totally hand tied and hence have been reducing their cost base. However, all these years later,  a market capitalisation of only \u00a328m, no income and a bank balance diminishing every year. We seem to be a one trick pony and I cannot see any foray into other producing activities would be possible given our balance sheet. Apologies if i am sounding depressed!",

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

The recent update has not supported the price. For those of us who have held for many years, it has been money locked in and most of us are likely sitting on losses. Both current and previous governments have caused great uncertainty and their own ideologies and fear of losing their privileged positions, rather than economic benefits to the UK and domestic sustainability, has meant that O&G investors are sitting on their hands in the NS and prioritising extraction elsewhere. It would be good to hear what NEO+ has to say as the major operator.  How high a priority is Buchan in their plans? Exactly what time schedule are we looking at for FDP approval and FID. How dependent is it on any adjustment to the tax issue? I imagine that JOG Board is totally hand tied and hence have been reducing their cost base. However, all these years later,  a market capitalisation of only \u00a328m, no income and a bank balance diminishing every year. We seem to be a one trick pony and I cannot see any foray into other producing activities would be possible given our balance sheet. Apologies if i am sounding depressed!",

Jog is a minuscule fish in a big pond ,  to commercialise Jog will cost a big number  . You cannot eliminate risk until FID . The FO bonuses come to my mind , the directors were a tad bit greedy ? .

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

The recent update has not supported the price. For those of us who have held for many years, it has been money locked in and most of us are likely sitting on losses. Both current and previous governments have caused great uncertainty and their own ideologies and fear of losing their privileged positions, rather than economic benefits to the UK and domestic sustainability, has meant that O&G investors are sitting on their hands in the NS and prioritising extraction elsewhere. It would be good to hear what NEO+ has to say as the major operator.  How high a priority is Buchan in their plans? Exactly what time schedule are we looking at for FDP approval and FID. How dependent is it on any adjustment to the tax issue? I imagine that JOG Board is totally hand tied and hence have been reducing their cost base. However, all these years later,  a market capitalisation of only \u00a328m, no income and a bank balance diminishing every year. We seem to be a one trick pony and I cannot see any foray into other producing activities would be possible given our balance sheet. Apologies if i am sounding depressed!",

Jog is a minuscule fish in a big pond ,  to commercialise Jog will cost a big number  . You cannot eliminate risk until FID . The FO bonuses come to my mind , the directors were a tad bit greedy ? .

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

This date is based on Wood Mackenzie's projection that a wave of new global LNG supply could significantly outstrip demand by early 2029, potentially driving NBP gas prices below the ESIM threshold (estimated at \u00a30.61\u2013\u00a30.63/therm by 2029) for the mandatory six-month monitoring period from January to June 2029.

The recent update has not supported the price. For those of us who have held for many years, it has been money locked in and most of us are likely sitting on losses. Both current and previous governments have caused great uncertainty and their own ideologies and fear of losing their privileged positions, rather than economic benefits to the UK and domestic sustainability, has meant that O&G investors are sitting on their hands in the NS and prioritising extraction elsewhere. It would be good to hear what NEO+ has to say as the major operator.  How high a priority is Buchan in their plans? Exactly what time schedule are we looking at for FDP approval and FID. How dependent is it on any adjustment to the tax issue? I imagine that JOG Board is totally hand tied and hence have been reducing their cost base. However, all these years later,  a market capitalisation of only \u00a328m, no income and a bank balance diminishing every year. We seem to be a one trick pony and I cannot see any foray into other producing activities would be possible given our balance sheet. Apologies if i am sounding depressed!",

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

The recent update has not supported the price. For those of us who have held for many years, it has been money locked in and most of us are likely sitting on losses. Both current and previous governments have caused great uncertainty and their own ideologies and fear of losing their privileged positions, rather than economic benefits to the UK and domestic sustainability, has meant that O&G investors are sitting on their hands in the NS and prioritising extraction elsewhere. It would be good to hear what NEO+ has to say as the major operator.  How high a priority is Buchan in their plans? Exactly what time schedule are we looking at for FDP approval and FID. How dependent is it on any adjustment to the tax issue? I imagine that JOG Board is totally hand tied and hence have been reducing their cost base. However, all these years later,  a market capitalisation of only \u00a328m, no income and a bank balance diminishing every year. We seem to be a one trick pony and I cannot see any foray into other producing activities would be possible given our balance sheet. Apologies if i am sounding depressed!",

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

Take windmills: those used in the UK (and EU) are mainly manufactured by Siemens, Vesta (the world leader) and GE. China is world leader in wind power generation and by early 2025 it had more than 50% of the world total offshore!

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",

This date is based on Wood Mackenzie's projection that a wave of new global LNG supply could significantly outstrip demand by early 2029, potentially driving NBP gas prices below the ESIM threshold (estimated at \u00a30.61\u2013\u00a30.63/therm by 2029) for the mandatory six-month monitoring period from January to June 2029.

The recent update has not supported the price. For those of us who have held for many years, it has been money locked in and most of us are likely sitting on losses. Both current and previous governments have caused great uncertainty and their own ideologies and fear of losing their privileged positions, rather than economic benefits to the UK and domestic sustainability, has meant that O&G investors are sitting on their hands in the NS and prioritising extraction elsewhere. It would be good to hear what NEO+ has to say as the major operator.  How high a priority is Buchan in their plans? Exactly what time schedule are we looking at for FDP approval and FID. How dependent is it on any adjustment to the tax issue? I imagine that JOG Board is totally hand tied and hence have been reducing their cost base. However, all these years later,  a market capitalisation of only \u00a328m, no income and a bank balance diminishing every year. We seem to be a one trick pony and I cannot see any foray into other producing activities would be possible given our balance sheet. Apologies if i am sounding depressed!",

          "content": "Big picture \u2022\tGovernment has finished its long consultations, so the rules on environment and tax are now known, which lets companies plan long term projects like Buchan more sensibly. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s partners (NEO and Serica) have bulked up via M&A, making Buchan part of two much larger, better capitalised UK North Sea portfolios. \u2022\tJOG itself has cut costs, has no debt, a modest but adequate cash pile, and a fully carried 20% stake in Buchan plus a further milestone payment due at FDP approval. UK tax and regulation \u2022\tEnvironmental rules now require Buchan to include Scope 3 emissions and socio economic benefits in its approvals paperwork. \u2022\tTax: the current Energy Profits Levy (EPL) runs to 1 April 2030, keeping the marginal rate at 78% until then; after that the new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) only adds extra tax when prices are unusually high, otherwise the rate reverts to 40%. \u2022\tThis makes it attractive to invest capital before 2030 (getting up to roughly 78\u201384% tax relief on spend) and then enjoy lower tax on production in the 2030s, assuming prices are not extreme. Buchan / Greater Buchan Area \u2022\tBuchan is described as a material project with about 70 mmboe 2P at field level and over 100 mmboe including wider GBA upside. \u2022\tThe JV is updating the Environmental Impact Assessment for the new Scope 3 rules, and doing value engineering on drilling and subsea to optimise capex before sanction. \u2022\tWestern Isles FPSO is now only one of several development options being re screened in 2026, reflecting the delay and NEO\u2019s expanded asset base. \u2022\tJOG and partners will apply to extend the P2498 (Buchan) and P2170 (Verbier area) licence terms, with FDP and EIA already submitted so the regulator is well briefed. \u2022\tThey have relinquished the riskiest part of P2170 to cut licence fees by about 40%, while keeping discoveries and better prospects. Strategy and M&A \u2022\tJOG says it is \u201cright sized\u201d: small, nimble, and focused on growing in a \u201csmart and sustainable\u201d way. \u2022\tPriority 1: unlock the organic value in GBA (Buchan + Verbier/J2 etc). \u2022\tPriority 2: look for accretive acquisitions, ideally producing UK assets that bring cash flow and let them use over \u00a3100m of tax allowances (including EPL losses); they are also looking at international producing assets if they fit and use capital sensibly. Financial position \u2022\tYear end 2025 cash is about \u00a311m, with no debt. \u2022\tAfter cutting running costs by c.50% in 2024, total cash spend in 2025 is ~\u00a31.5m, with 2026 expected to be slightly less if nothing major changes. \u2022\tJOG\u2019s 20% share of Buchan capex is fully carried by NEO and Serica, and JOG is due a further US$20m in cash when Buchan\u2019s FDP is approved and all consents are granted. In short, the message is: the policy clouds have cleared, Buchan is being optimised rather than rushed, JOG\u2019s big partners are getting even bigger, and JOG itself is lean, funded, carried on Buchan and hunting dea",

I am a long-term holder in JOG - have been invested since 2017 - and this is now one of only two investments I have in the markets. Having invested steadily over the past 8 years I am of course disappointed that the current share price is well below my average break-even level, I certainly never anticipated I would have been looking at a 10 year plus period to get a return on my holding. However I believe AB and his team have done little wrong in taking the business to where it is at now. They have successfully negotiated 2 farm-out deals with major players who have long-term interests in North Sea O&G, and have retained a 20% fully funded carry to first oil.  Maybe the Board were premature in taking bonuses on completion of the farm out agreements but they have little control over the ludicrous attitude being shown to the whole Oil & Gas industry by our incumbent incompetent Government. Analysts are still positive for the long-term success of JOG, particularly given we now have clarification of the taxation treatment post EPL. I share this view but certainly have sympathy for long term investors like myself who can only sit tight and remain patient!",
