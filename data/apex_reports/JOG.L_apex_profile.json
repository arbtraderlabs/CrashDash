          "content": "14 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 7771O\nJersey Oil and Gas PLC\n14 January 2026\n14\nJanuary 2026\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\n(\"Jersey Oil & Gas\", \"JOG\"\nor the\n\"Company\")\nCorporate Update\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM: JOG), an independent upstream oil and gas company \u200efocused on the UK Continental Shelf region of the North Sea, is pleased to provide a corporate update and outlook for the year ahead.\nHighlights\n\u00a7\nOutcome of the UK Government's regulatory and fiscal consultations have been set - providing an opportunity to optimise the investment programme for development projects like Buchan\n\u00a7\nWork planned to assess the optimal Buchan development solution within the re-set investment horizon\n\u00a7\nBuchan joint venture partners are materially growing through further corporate consolidations - Buchan well positioned\n\u00a7\nJOG's solid financial position maintained - the business is right-sized for its current activities and focused on achieving its growth potential\nUK Oil & Gas Industry Landscape\n\u00a7\nFollowing the lengthy regulatory and fiscal consultations carried out by the UK Government during 2025, clarity was finally obtained in the latter part of the year on both the future application of environmental regulations and the longer-term fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry. The environmental consultation confirmed the need for oil and gas developments like Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") to assess the Scope 3 emissions arising from the project as part of its regulatory approval submissions. In terms of the fiscal regime, the consultation resulted in the continued application of the Energy Profits Levy (\"EPL\") in its current form until 1 April 2030, which implies a marginal tax rate of 78% for the industry. The successor regime, the Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (\"OGPM\"), replaces the EPL with a revenue-based model for calculating windfall profits, that levies a 35% tax only on the revenues generated above applicable commodity threshold prices (in addition to the corporate and supplementary tax rate of 40%).\n\u00a7\nUnder the OGPM two independent threshold price points will be set annually, one for oil (in dollars per barrel) and one for gas (in pence per therm). The thresholds in financial year 2026-27 have been set at $90/bbl for oil and 90p/therm for gas - they will be adjusted annually in line with CPI inflation and are projected to be around $98/bbl and 98p/therm by 2030. When in effect the OGPM restores the tax rate to the 40% headline rate in the permanent regime, with the OGPM only applying to oil or gas revenues in the event the respective commodity price is unusually high.\n\u00a7\nThe interplay between the EPL and OGPM regimes provides tax\npaying companies with the opportunity to continue securing a 78% tax offset (including 38% attributable to the EPL) for every pound invested between now and 2030 (or 84.25% when including the investment allowance available on the Supplementary Charge Tax), alongside the potential to generate revenue from those investing activities post 2030 with just the permanent 40% tax rate applicable so long as commodity prices remain under the OGPM threshold prices. This points to it being optimal for long term investments being undertaken between now and the end of the decade.\n\u00a7\nAlongside the changes in the regulatory and fiscal landscape, 2025 was also marked by a step change in the scale of both our Buchan joint venture partners. NEO Energy Limited, the operator for the Buchan development project, not only combined its business with the UK subsidiary of Repsol S.A., but in December 2025 it announced a subsequent merger with the UK business of TotalEnergies S.A., to create NEO Next+ (\"NEO\").\n\u00a7\nUpon completion of the NEO Next+ transaction, NEO will become the leading operator and producer in the UK North Sea, with an expected production portfolio of over 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\").\n\u00a7\nSerica Energy (\"Serica\") (AIM: SQZ) also announced a series of strategic acquisitions during the year, establishing the business as the leading mid-tier UK North Sea producer.\nGreater Buchan Area\n\u00a7\nThe major transformations that have taken place with NEO and Serica places the growth prospects that the Buchan project provides within two high-quality, UK North Sea focused asset portfolios. Access to a project with estimated gross mid case proven and probable resources of approximately 70 million barrels of oil equivalent represents a material prize at this stage of the UK North Sea lifecycle.\n\u00a7\nThere continues to be active engagement between the Buchan joint venture partners, particularly around the key strategic engineering decisions and plans for the development. Work is progressing to prepare the necessary addendum to the Buchan Environmental Impact Assessment incorporating the requirements of the updated guidance regarding the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions, as well as setting out the socio-economic benefits to the UK that the development will deliver. Value engineering work is also being completed, particularly with respect to drilling and subsea infrastructure scopes of work, as part of the pre-sanction technical work aimed at optimising the capital expenditure programme for developing the field.\n\u00a7\nNEO's recent strategic moves also provide the Buchan joint venture with the means to assess the development solution for the field with a wider lens. While the \"Western Isles\" floating production, storage and offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel has been set out as the development solution in the draft Field Development Plan (\"FDP\"), the passage of time resulting from the delays caused by the Government's industry consultations means other potential production solutions warrant further screening and consideration. As such, the FPSO represents one of several options for Buchan. Additional development engineering activities to evaluate these alternatives will now form part of the project work programme to be completed during 2026.\n\u00a7\nThe Greater Buchan Area (\"GBA\") partners elected to partially relinquish a portion of the P2170 \"Verbier\" licence acreage in late 2025. This enabled an approximately 40% reduction in licence fees, attributable to the cost of the area that\ncontained the highest risk exploration prospect on the licence (the retained licence area still contains the Verbier and J2 discoveries and the \"Verbier Deep\" and \"Cortina\" exploration prospects). The Company's P2170 licence costs are not carried by its Buchan joint venture partners.\n\u00a7\nThe P2498 (\"Buchan\") and P2170 licences are both in the Second Term, the period in which licencees need to obtain FDP approval in order to subsequently move into the Third Term, which covers the development and production phase of activities for the life of a field. The end of the Second Term of the P2498 licence is 28 February 2027 and 29 August 2026 for the P2170 licence. Significant progress has been made on the Buchan development, which facilitates unlocking the wider GBA resource base contained in licence P2170, and an application to extend the Second Term duration of both licences will be made to the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\") during the current year. With the draft FDP and associated Environmental Impact Assessment for the Buchan development already submitted to the NSTA, the regulator is fully briefed on the joint venture's plans for the GBA and NEO is well placed to continue its engagement with the regulator on the proposed extensions.\nStrategic Focus\n\u00a7\nThe Company's vision is centred on successfully growing the business in a smart and sustainable way, developing important domestic energy supply in response to society's energy needs and creating value for our stakeholders. The organisation is \"right sized\" for the stage and scale of its activities and maintains a nimble approach to advancing its key strategic objectives.\n\u00a7\nThe Company remains sharply focused on unlocking the organic value of its existing assets in the GBA, combined with the pursuit of potential accretive asset acquisitions that bring cash flow, diversity and quality investment opportunities into the portfolio.\n\u00a7\nWith over \u00a3100 million of UK tax allowances, including an element of EPL losses, UK North Sea opportunities continue to be thoroughly assessed in terms of their potential strategic fit. The Company is also evaluating international producing asset opportunities which have the potential to sensibly deploy the financial resources of the business.\nSolid Financial Position\n\u00a7\nThe Company's cash balance at the end of 2025 was approximately \u00a311 million with no debt.\n\u00a7\nThe cash running cost of the business were reduced by approximately 50% at the end of 2024, as a result of the actions taken following the slowdown in activities on the Buchan project. As a result total cash expenditure in 2025 is expected to be approximately \u00a31.5 million, with the corresponding cash cost for 2026 currently projected to be a little under this level absent any changes in the underlying activities of the business.\n\u00a7\nPer the terms of the farm-out agreements executed with NEO and Serica, the Company's 20% share of Buchan project expenditure is fully carried by its two joint venture partners. A further $20 million cash payment is payable under the terms of the agreements following approval of the FDP by the NSTA and receipt of the associated regulatory and legal consents.\nAndrew Benitz, CEO of Jersey Oil & Gas, commented\n:\n\"It is clear that the regulatory and fiscal consultations the Government has undertaken since coming into office in July 2024 have disrupted the UK North Sea oil and gas industry and stifled investment activities. However, the outcome of the consultations have now been finalised and the fiscal terms within which to best optimise investment decisions have been set. These terms point to a longer investment cycle over the coming years, which maximises value across the applicable fiscal regimes. For Buchan, taking the time now, to verify and engineer the best possible development solution within that cycle, should ultimately enhance the overall value of the project for all parties.\nWhile the Government has been working to set the overall parameters in which the industry operates, the corporate landscape has also evolved. Most notably our joint venture partner and Buchan field operator, NEO Next+, on completion of its latest deal, will establish itself as the largest operator and producer in the UK North Sea. This represents an exciting step, both for us to be working alongside the leading player in the basin and to be part of one of the key growth opportunities in its asset portfolio. The Greater Buchan Area, with estimated gross resources of over 100 MMboe and significant exploration upside, represents a material opportunity on a standalone basis and within the outlook of the UK sector as a whole.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero.

This has the potential to unlock significant UK investment, create over 1,000 well paid jobs and ultimately realise hundreds of millions in future tax payments to the exchequer. We urge the government to complete its consultation process on the future fiscal regime and remove the EPL in order to establish a playing field that facilitates future investments. Homegrown energy should be prioritised over more carbon intensive energy imports and with Buchan, we have a great opportunity to be at the forefront of championing a fully integrated production hub that aligns with the industry's decarbonisation strategy.\"\nEnquiries\n:\nJersey Oil and Gas plc\nAndrew Benitz\nc/o Camarco:\n020 3757 4980\nStrand Hanson Limited\nJames Harris\nMatthew Chandler\nJames Bellman\nTel: 020 7409 3494\nZeus Capital Limited\nSimon Johnson\nTel: 020 3829 5000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nCamarco\nBilly Clegg\nRebecca Waterworth\nTel: 020 3757 4980\n- Ends -\nNotes to Editors\n:\nJersey Oil & Gas (AIM:JOG) is a UK energy company focused on creating shareholder value through the development of oil and gas assets and the execution of accretive transactions.\nThe Company has a focused asset portfolio centred on developing homegrown North Sea resources that support the UK's energy requirements as it transitions towards net zero. JOG holds a 20% interest in each of licences P2498 (Blocks 20/5a, 20/5e and 21/1a) and P2170 (Blocks 20/5b and 21/1d) located in the UK Central North Sea and referred to as the \"Greater Buchan Area\" (\"GBA\"). Licence P2498 contains the Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") oil field and J2 oil discovery and licence P2170 contains the Verbier oil discovery.\nJOG's strategy is focused on unlocking the organic value of its GBA assets, combined with the pursuit of potential asset acquisitions that bring cash flow, diversity and quality investment opportunities into the portfolio. The Company's Board and Executive team have a wealth of experience in managing and growing publicly listed energy companies and a strong track-record of value creation in the UK North Sea's oil and gas sector.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the usual risk factors and uncertainties associated with an oil and gas business. Whilst the Company believes the expectations reflected herein to be reasonable in light of the information available to it at this time, the actual outcome may be materially different owing to factors beyond the Company's control or otherwise within the Company's control but where, for example, the Company decides on a change of plan or strategy.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REPORT\nFollowing the progress made in 2023 and 2024 to advance the Buchan Horst (\"Buchan\") redevelopment project towards sanction and Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval, the first half of this year has involved a concerted effort to engage with the UK government on the future of the UK North Sea and the fundamentals required to maximise the long term value of the oil and gas industry for the benefit of all. This engagement has been driven by the three public consultations that have been launched by the government since taking office in July 2024 concerning the inclusion of \"Scope 3\" emissions in environmental impact assessments (\"EIAs\"), the future for UK North Sea oil and gas licensing and the long-term fiscal regime.\nOur team has worked closely with our Buchan joint venture partners, NEO NEXT Energy (\"NEO\") and Serica Energy (\"Serica\"), and industry trade bodies to shape our responses to the public consultations. We are encouraged that the government has now issued new guidelines for EIA submissions and this should pave the way for new development projects like Buchan to secure formal approval following over a year of regulatory inactivity. This will naturally require an addendum to the previously submitted Buchan EIA to be issued to the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for the Environment and Decommissioning (\"OPRED\") as part of the overall regulatory process required to reach FDP approval.\nWhile clarity has been obtained on the environmental guidelines for new developments, the conclusions to the fiscal and licensing consultations remain outstanding. Most significantly, it is the outcome of the fiscal consultation that will dictate the ability of the joint venture to progress Buchan towards project sanction and FDP approval\nDevelopment Activities\nThe uncertainties created by the various abovementioned fiscal and regulatory consultations resulted in a slowdown in the Buchan redevelopment project's activities in 2024. Nevertheless, targeted activities have continued during the first half of 2025, with a key focus being on how to incorporate Scope 3 emissions into the Buchan environmental statement. The joint venture has been working with Genesis, a leading energy consulting company that supported the initial regulatory submission, to undertake the necessary additional preparatory work. A number of other technical and commercial workflows have also been progressed throughout the period, including the continuation of subsurface modelling studies, the specification of the optimal drilling completion plan for the requisite production wells and the agreement of commercial terms for the utilisation of gas export infrastructure. Alongside the preparation of the environmental statement addendum, work is also scheduled to commence on value engineering opportunities and optimisations around the forecast capital expenditure for the project. This represents an important element of the assurance and peer review processes that the joint venture undertakes as part of the project sanction and regulatory approval activities.\nIn light of the project delays created by the various consultations, an extension to the Buchan P2498 licence was obtained from the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\") earlier in the year. The extension gives the joint venture until 28 February 2027 to obtain Field Development Plan (\"FDP\") approval.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the timing of FDP approval, the agreement for the acquisition of the \"Western Isles\" floating production, storage and offloading (\"FPSO\") vessel for redeployment on the Buchan field was terminated in March 2025 by Dana Petroleum after the longstop date in the agreement was passed. NEO, Buchan's Operator, is a 23% owner of the vessel and the possibility remains to recontract the vessel at the appropriate time for deployment on Buchan. The vessel remains anchored in Scapa Flow in the Orkney Isles, having departed the Western Isles field location in summer 2024.\nSubject to satisfactory clarity being obtained from the government consultations, there are clear steps that need to be completed to move the Buchan project forward to FDP approval and onward thereafter into the development execution phase of activities. These are:\n\u00a7\nReactivation and completion of the contract tender process for the main drilling, subsea and FPSO modification workscopes\n\u00a7\nRe-contracting of the FPSO\n\u00a7\nSubmission to OPRED of an updated EIA that incorporates the requirements of the recently issued guidance concerning the inclusion of Scope 3 emission forecasts for the project\n\u00a7\nJoint venture finalisation of the FDP and approval of the NSTA\nWhile the exact timeline for completing these activities has not yet been finalised, it is likely that a positive outcome from the consultations would lead to FDP approval being targeted during 2026.\nSupport for Domestic Industry\nThe facts point time and time again to a balanced energy system providing the best solution to our country's energy security. Unfortunately, the net zero debate has become polarised, unnecessarily pitting domestic hydrocarbons against green alternatives - the stark reality is that we need it all to satisfy the country's energy demands and minimise hydrocarbon imports. In the case of Buchan, the project has the potential to contribute approximately 70 million barrels of oil equivalent (\"Mmboe\") to future North Sea production. Importantly, it also provides the opportunity to unlock capital investment of around \u00a31 billion into the UK economy, create over 1,000 well paid jobs across the UK, generate a new energy hub that helps facilitate investment into a major new floating offshore wind project and pay hundreds of millions in tax to the Exchequer. It is therefore hoped that the positive economic impact that Buchan, and potential other North Sea projects like it, can have on the UK, will be recognised in the actions of the government as it works to close out its on-going fiscal and regulatory consultations over the coming months. The UK needs economic growth and a project like Buchan would be particularly accretive to the economy for years to come.\nThe fiscal consultation is of critical importance to our project and we are hopeful of seeing clarity on this aspect during the Autumn Statement. The alternative oil and gas pricing mechanisms that have been tabled as a replacement for the Energy Profits Levy (\"EPL\"), which punitively taxes all profits at 78%, sets a threshold price above which a windfall tax would be charged. While the mechanisms being considered are workable alternatives, the key elements concerning the actual commodity prices at which the additional tax would kick in, and the level of the tax itself, are yet to be defined. We are far from being in a windfall commodity price environment, as has been reflected in other countries which imposed similar windfall taxes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and have now removed them. To mitigate some of the damage the EPL has already done, industry is urging the government to replace it with the mechanism resulting from the current consultation rather than waiting until 2030 when it is currently scheduled to fall away.\nSolid Financial Position\nFinancially the Group is strongly positioned with total cash reserves at the end of H1 2025 of \u00a311.3 million and no debt.\nThe total annualised cash running cost of the business has been reduced by approximately 50% to an expected \u00a31.5 million. In addition to cutting corporate and operational costs, all staff and Directors' salaries have been reduced by 50% to reflect the slowdown in Buchan project activities at this time.\nAs a result of the terms of the farm-out agreements executed with NEO and Serica, the Company's 20% share of Buchan project expenditure is fully carried by our two joint venture partners, based on the approved FDP budget. A further $20 million in cash is receivable under the terms of the farm-out agreements following approval of the Buchan FDP by the NSTA and receipt of the associated regulatory and legal consents.\nSummary and Outlook\nJOG is well placed financially to see through this period of protracted uncertainty for the industry, however the reduction in investment activity witnessed across the UK Continental Shelf as a direct result of the EPL is damaging sentiment and driving investment elsewhere. We urge the government to remove the EPL as soon as practicable. All forms of domestic energy must rank above more carbon intensive energy imports and with Buchan, we have a great opportunity to be at the forefront of championing a fully integrated production hub that aligns with the industry's decarbonisation strategy.\nThere is also more for us to do as we seek to grow our business in the North Sea. To both accelerate potential value creation from the Company's existing UK tax allowances of over $100 million and bring cash flow into the business, a number of potential producing asset acquisitions have been pursued and we continue to be proactive in our efforts to grow the business for the collective benefit of our shareholders and other stakeholders. We greatly appreciate and value the support and patience we have received from our shareholders at this complicated time for the industry.\nLes Thomas\nNon-Executive Chairman\nAndrew Benitz\nChief

The address of its registered office is 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London WC2H 9JQ.\nThe reporting period for the Group's condensed consolidated interim financial statements is the six-month period from 1 January 2025 to 30 June 2025, which were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 3 September 2025.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Preparation\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 were prepared in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\").\nThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared following the same accounting policies and methods of computation as the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company's annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe financial information contained herein does not constitute statutory financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nConsolidated statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024, on which the auditors gave an unqualified audit report, have been filed with the Registrar of Companies.\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the Group's functional currency.\nGoing Concern\nThe Group has sufficient resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months after the date of issue of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. The Company's current cash reserves are expected to more than exceed its estimated cash outflows in all reasonable scenarios for at least 12 months following the date of issue of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Even in a scenario where the Buchan redevelopment project did not progress for whatever reason(s) and the future farm-out instalment payments were not realised the Group has the funds to continue in business beyond the next 12 months solely from utilisation of its existing cash resources. The directors have also considered the risk associated with contractual arrangements associated with progression of the Buchan redevelopment project and are satisfied that the Group is not exposed to any contractual commitments which could impact on the Group's going concern status over the next 12 months. Based on these circumstances, the directors have considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nAccounting policies\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's latest audited annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe impact of seasonality or cyclicality on operations is not considered significant on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\n3. SEGMENTAL REPORTING\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board of Directors.\nThe Board considers that the Group operates in a single segment, that of oil and gas exploration, appraisal, development, and production, in a single geographical location, the North Sea of the United Kingdom.\nThe Board as a whole is the Group's chief operating decision maker within the meaning of IFRS 8 \"Operating Segments\".\nDuring the period to 30 June 2025 and during the year ended 31 December 2024 the Group had no revenue.\n4. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nThe following significant costs are included:\n30/06/25\n30/06/24\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nThird Party Transaction Fees / Bonuses\n-\n1,187,661\nNon-Cash Share Based Payments (net)\n(67,531)\n541,889\nThe H1 2024 Transaction Fees/Bonuses include payments of \u00a3490,000 to the Executive Directors earned because of the Serica Farm-out and settled conditional upon deal completion. Non-Cash Share Based Payments decreased in H1 2025 mainly due to share options issued to Directors in January 2018 expiring in January 2025.\n5. TAX\nJersey Oil and Gas plc is a trading company but no liability to UK corporation tax arose on its ordinary activities for the period ended 30 June 2025 due to trading losses. As at 31 December 2024, the Group held tax losses of approximately \u00a362m (2023: \u00a363m).\n6. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic loss per share is calculated by dividing the losses attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nThere is no difference between dilutive and basic loss per share due to there being a loss recorded in the period.\nThe share options issued in the Group that would potentially dilute earnings per share in the future have not been included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nLosses attributable to ordinary shareholders\nWeighted average number of shares\nPer share amount\nPence\n\u00a3\nPeriod ended 30\u00a0June\u00a02025\nBasic and Diluted EPS\nLoss attributable to ordinary shareholders\n(697,258)\n32,667,627\n(2.13)\n7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nExploration\nCosts\n\u00a3\nCOST\nAt 1 January 2025\n11,916,647\nAdditions\n54,570\nAt 30 June 2025\n11,971,217\nACCUMULATED AMORTISATION\nAt 1 January 2025\n175,241\nAt 30 June 2025\n175,241\nCARRYING AMOUNT 30 June 2025\n11,795,976\nAdditions represent the work capitalised on the Buchan redevelopment assets.\nAt the start of 2023 the Company owned 100% interests in two licenses; P2498 containing the Buchan field and J2 Discovery, and P2170 containing the Verbier discovery.\nAt the end of 2023 the costs incurred in acquiring and advancing the licenses to their current state was \u00a325,700,982 (2022: \u00a324,548,122). During 2023 a farm-out of a 50% interest in both licenses to NEO was completed and in 2024 a farm out of a 30% interest in both licenses to Serica was completed. Both deals had similar terms whereby in exchange for the farm in, the respective parties agreed to a series of cash payments and both a pre-development and development carry on the Buchan Redevelopment project. In accordance with our farm-out policy for assets at that stage of development, the cash proceeds of \u00a35,519,216 in 2024 and \u00a39,103,944 in 2023 were both deducted from the carrying value of the assets.\nIn line with the requirements of IFRS 6, we have considered whether there are any indicators of impairment on the exploration and development assets. Based on our assessment, as at 30 June 2025 there were not deemed to be indicators that the licences are not commercial and that the carrying value of \u00a311,795,976 continues to be supported by ongoing development work on the licence areas with no impairments considered necessary. It is noted that increases in North Sea taxes in 2024 together with further fiscal instability created by the ongoing government consultation has increased uncertainty around the timing of potential sanction of the Buchan redevelopment project by the Joint Venture.\n8.

There are immaterial expected credit losses recognised on these balances.\n10.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe amounts disclosed in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows in respect of cash and cash equivalents are in respect of these consolidated statement of financial position amounts:\n30/06/25\n30/06/24\n31/12/24\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash and cash equivalents\n834,777\n2,031,761\n6,185,872\nThe cash balances are placed with creditworthy financial institutions with a minimum rating of 'A'.\n11.

The weighted average lessee's incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on 1 January 2019 was 3%. The borrowing rate applied for 2025 remained at 3% and the leases relate to office space. A new lease agreement was entered into in June 2023 for a total of 9 years with break clauses after 3 and 6 years. Given the 3-year break clause and the future plans for the business it was deemed appropriate to recognise the liability relating to a 3-year period.\nAmounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income:\n30/06/25\n30/06/24\n31/12/24\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nDepreciation charge of right-of-use asset\nBuildings\n27,932\n27,932\n55,864\n27,932\n27,932\n55,864\n30/06/25\n30/06/24\n31/12/24\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nInterest expenses (included in finance cost)\nBuildings\n(968)\n(1,799)\n(3,185)\n(968)\n(1,799)\n(3,185)\n13.
