Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n15 January 2026\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\n2025 Full Year Trading Update\nFinseta (AIM: FIN), a foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform, provides the following update on trading for the year ended 31 December 2025 (\"FY 2025\").\nThe Group expects to report FY 2025 revenue of \u00a312.4m (FY 2024: \u00a311.4m), an increase of 9%, reflecting growth in both active customers to 1,1011 (FY 2024: 1,059) and average revenue per customer. After receiving regulatory approval in March 2025 to provide payment services in the United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\"), the Group achieved significant growth in its Dubai operation, ahead of the Board's initial expectations, and consequently invested further in the sales team to support accelerated future growth in the region. Together with further expansion of the UK sales teams in 2025, the Group also saw strong growth in business with corporate clients in the UK. Total revenues from corporate clients increased by 54% compared with FY 2024 and represented 57% of FY 2025 Group revenues (FY 2024: 41%). The growth in revenues from Dubai and from corporate clients served to largely mitigate the impact of the previously-reported effects on foreign exchange rates and the global economy of tariff-related developments, which continued to constrain active customer conversion and payments activity during the second half of the year, particularly amongst high net worth individual (\"HNWI\") clients.\nThe Group's gross margin is expected to be approximately 61% (FY 2024: 65.7%), as a result of the greater weighting towards corporate clients in the FY 2025 revenue mix. Whilst corporate client gross margins are lower than HNWIs, corporate clients typically transact more regularly and provide greater revenue recurrence.\nDuring 2025 the business made substantial strategic and operational progress, with the receipt of regulatory approval to provide payments services in the UAE, the establishment of a full-service office in Canada, the launch of the Finseta Corporate Card scheme, the establishment of new counterparty partnerships and the implementation of UK agency banking in Q3, which enables Finseta to issue its own account numbers and connect indirectly to the Faster Payments System. The Group made planned investments in FY 2025 to support these activities and position Finseta to benefit from expanded geographical and market reach, and a broader product and service offering, which it believes will lead to accelerated sales growth and increased profitability in the medium term. Whilst doing so, Finseta has maintained cost discipline with total operating costs for the year anticipated to be in line with the Board's expectations at the time of the interim results in September 2025. As a result of the planned investment in sales, compliance and overhead functions, and trading conditions during FY 2025, the Group expects to report adjusted EBITDA2 of approximately \u00a30.1m (FY 2024: \u00a32.0m).\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2025 were \u00a31.5m (31 December 2024: \u00a32.6m) resulting in net debt3 of \u00a30.3m (31 December 2024: net cash of \u00a30.6m). This primarily reflects reduced operating cash flow in FY 2025 and a cash outflow from investing activities of approximately \u00a31.1m (FY 2024: \u00a31.3m), on account of the Group's planned investment in its strategic growth initiatives, which will support growth in future periods. The Group expects to return to cash flow generation in H2 2026.\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"2025 was a year of substantial strategic progress. We delivered against all of our strategic objectives for the year - most notably with the ramp up of our operation in Dubai and completing the implementation of UK agency banking. While our revenue growth was constrained by macroeconomic factors, the strategic progress and investments we made during the year position us to broaden our offering,\naccelerate sales growth and increase profitability in the medium term.\n\"\nInvestor Presentation\nFinseta plc is pleased to announce that James Hickman, CEO, and Judy Happe, CFO, will provide a live presentation relating to the 2025 Full Year Trading Update via Investor Meet Company on 22 January 2026 at 9.30am GMT.\nThe presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders.

A conversion price of 19 pence per Ordinary Share has been used for the \u00a3200k Loan Note conversion, which represents a 35.7 per cent. premium to the closing price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on AIM on 12 November 2025. The Company's ability to elect for early repayment of the remainder of the Loan Note has been retained. The Loan Note coupon has been amended to 8.5 per cent. from 6.0 per cent., to reflect increases in the Bank of England's Bank Rate since the coupon was last set in August 2022.\nIn addition, Mr O'Brien has agreed to vary certain elements of his compensation package, including decreasing his commission share on certain revenue streams with effect from 1 February 2026. This, alongside the amended Loan Note terms, is expected to be cash flow beneficial for the Company in future years.\nAs Chief Commercial Officer and a substantial shareholder, the Board believes that the amendment of the terms of the Loan Note and Mr O'Brien's incentivisation and compensation arrangements reflect his strong support and alignment in prioritising the deployment of Finseta's resources to drive growth. Whilst the Company held cash and cash equivalents of \u00a32.3m as at 12 November 2025, and has no financial debt other than the Loan Note, the variations agreed with Mr O'Brien provide the Company with greater flexibility to continue to invest in its three-pillar growth strategy.\nAs Mr O'Brien is classified as a substantial shareholder for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"), the variation of the terms of the Loan Note held by, and the incentivisation arrangements with, Mr O'Brien constitute a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. The Company's Directors consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Shore Capital, that the terms of these variations are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nIssue of Ordinary Shares and Total Voting Rights\nThe Company has issued and allotted 1,052,632 new Ordinary Shares to Mr O'Brien, at a price of 19 pence per Ordinary Share, in respect of the conversion of \u00a3200k of the Loan Note principal. Following this issuance, Mr O'Brien has an interest in 10,452,632 Ordinary Shares, representing 17.7 per cent. of the Company's enlarged issued share capital.\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 1,052,632 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\") and it is expected that Admission will become effective at 8:00 a.m. on or around 19 November 2025. The new Ordinary\u00a0Shares\u00a0will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing issued Ordinary Shares in the Company.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 59,019,733. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. The figure of 59,019,733 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nEnquiries\nFinseta plc\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nJames Hickman, Chief Executive Officer\nJudy Happe, Chief Financial Officer\nShore Capital (N\nominated Adviser and\nBroker)\n+44 (0)207 408 4090\nDaniel Bush, Tom Knibbs (Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn (Corporate Broking)\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\n+44 (0)204 582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Claire Norbury\nAbout Finseta plc\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN) is a foreign exchange and payments company offering multi-currency accounts and payment solutions to businesses and individuals.

The Company's Directors consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Shore Capital, that the terms of these variations are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nIssue of Ordinary Shares and Total Voting Rights\nThe Company has issued and allotted 1,052,632 new Ordinary Shares to Mr O'Brien, at a price of 19 pence per Ordinary Share, in respect of the conversion of \u00a3200k of the Loan Note principal. Following this issuance, Mr O'Brien has an interest in 10,452,632 Ordinary Shares, representing 17.7 per cent. of the Company's enlarged issued share capital.\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 1,052,632 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\") and it is expected that Admission will become effective at 8:00 a.m. on or around 19 November 2025. The new Ordinary\u00a0Shares\u00a0will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing issued Ordinary Shares in the Company.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 59,019,733. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. The figure of 59,019,733 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nEnquiries\nFinseta plc\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nJames Hickman, Chief Executive Officer\nJudy Happe, Chief Financial Officer\nShore Capital (N\nominated Adviser and\nBroker)\n+44 (0)207 408 4090\nDaniel Bush, Tom Knibbs (Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn (Corporate Broking)\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\n+44 (0)204 582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Claire Norbury\nAbout Finseta plc\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN) is a foreign exchange and payments company offering multi-currency accounts and payment solutions to businesses and individuals.

We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year.

Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n9 July 2025\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\" or the \"Company\")\nH1 2025 Trading Update\nOn track to deliver full year results in line with Board expectations, including significant revenue growth\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN),\na foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform\n, provides the following unaudited update on trading for the six months ended 30 June 2025 (\"H1 2025\").\nThe Group expects to report an increase in revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2025 of approximately 16% to \u00a35.9m (H1 2024: \u00a35.1m), driven by an increase in active customers1 to 1,101 (H1 2024: 952). The Group expects to report a gross margin for H1 2025 of approximately 62% (H1 2024: 65.7%), which is due to revenue mix, and adjusted2\u00a0EBITDA of c.\u00a0\u00a30.3m (H1 2024:\u00a0\u00a30.8m), reflecting the investment in the Group's new strategic initiatives, which have substantially broadened the Group's capabilities and are expected to significantly accelerate sales growth and increase profitability in the medium term.\nBy client type, there was an increase in revenue generated by both private clients (primarily high net worth individuals) and corporate accounts in H1 2025. The proportion of total revenue accounted for by private clients was 42% (H1 2024: 60%) with corporate accounts contributing 58% (H1 2024: 38%).\nNew customers onboarded to the Finseta platform in H1 2025 but yet to transact were significantly higher than the first half of the prior year, and ahead of management's expectations, positioning the Group for further growth. The conversion of newly onboarded customers to active customers during the period was constrained by the effects on foreign exchange (\"FX\") rates and the global economy of tariff-related developments during H1 2025. A large proportion of the Group's customer base typically use Finseta's services for high-value purchases such as international real estate, and the Group saw some payment transactions being delayed until H2 2025. The Group expects these transactions will resume in the second half of the year as FX rates normalise and customers complete their underlying transactions.\nThe Group's new strategic initiatives - namely its corporate card scheme and operations in Canada and Dubai - commenced in H1 2025, generating first revenues during the period; revenues are expected to increase from these initiatives as the second half of the year progresses. In Dubai, following authorisation from the\u00a0Dubai Financial Services Authority to provide payment services within the\u00a0United Arab Emirates, the Group commenced the expansion of its operations, which will continue through H2 2025, including hiring a number of new salespeople.\nCash generated from operating activities in H1 2025 was c.\u00a0\u00a30.3m\u00a0(H1 2024:\u00a0\u00a30.8m). Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2025 were \u00a32.4m (31 December 2024:\u00a0\u00a32.6m) resulting in net cash3\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a30.4m\u00a0(31 December 2024:\u00a0\u00a30.6m).\nLooking ahead, the Board expects that the Group will deliver a strong second half of the year and report results for FY 2025 in line with its expectations. The Board expects significant H2 2025 revenue growth consistent with previous years, at an improved gross margin compared to H1 2025, supported by anticipated transactions from the encouraging new customer onboarding activity in H1 2025 as markets normalise and from on-going growth from the Group's strategic initiatives.\nThe Group will provide further information in its interim results announcement, which is expected to be published in September 2025.\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"This has been a milestone period for Finseta as we launched our corporate card scheme and significantly expanded our international capabilities with full-service offerings in Dubai and Canada. While the global economic conditions resulted in customers delaying transactions, our strong levels of customer acquisition means we are well-positioned as markets normalise in H2. As a result, and with our new strategic initiatives set to ramp-up in H2, we remain on track to deliver significant revenue growth for FY 2025 and look to the future with great confidence.\"\nNotes\n1\nDefined as customers who traded through Finseta during the six-month periods to 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 respectively\n2\nAdjusted to exclude other operating income, share-based compensation, profit from the disposal of a subsidiary and transaction costs (in H1 2024), and the rental cost of the Group's corporate premises\n3\nDefined as cash and cash equivalents less loan notes\nEnquiries\nFinseta plc\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nJam",

It contains a diverse ecosystem of international businesses, including a large presence of professional services firms that the Group can leverage through its introducer-led customer acquisition model.\nThe Group has an existing presence in Dubai, where it has been building a partner network. The DFSA Licence will enable the Group to significantly expand its activities by now being able to service corporate and professional clients in the UAE as well as to benefit from local payment rails.\nThe Group has established a new office in the DIFC and expects to make a series of key hires over the coming months in its sales and regulatory and compliance support functions to facilitate business development activities, including broadening partner relationships, and the onboarding of new clients in compliance with local regulations. The expanded UAE business is expected to make a positive contribution to Group profitability from 2026.\nThe expansion of activities in the UAE together with the Group's intended investment in sales, compliance and overhead functions in 2025 to exploit the growth opportunity in the Canadian market following the receipt of a regulatory licence in 2024, and to support the scale-up of the Group's corporate card programme following its commercial launch, as announced on 3 March 2025, operating expenses are expected to be higher than previously forecast. These investments will increase Group operating expenses from the current year onwards but are expected to drive incremental sales growth in the current year, and significantly accelerate sales growth and increase profitability in the medium term.\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"The receipt of this licence marks another milestone in the execution on our strategy. As one of the world's top financial centres, Dubai represents a significant opportunity for Finseta. We already have established foundations there, which, with some initial investment, we expect to scale to drive strong growth in this market. Our introducer-led go-to-market approach is also particularly well-suited to this business environment with international professional services and advisory firms having a substantial presence. We look forward to expanding our activities in Dubai and reporting on our progress.\"\nEnquiries\nFinseta plc\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nJames Hickman, Chief Executive Officer\nJudy Happe, Chief Financial Officer\nShore Capital (N\nominated Adviser and\nBroker)\n+44 (0)207 408 4090\nDaniel Bush, Tom Knibbs (Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn (Corporate Broking)\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\n+44 (0)204 582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Claire Norbury, Henry Gamble\nAbout Finseta plc\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN) is a foreign exchange and payments company offering multi-currency accounts and payment solutions to businesses and individuals.

The Group will market the new offering initially to its existing customer base with this additional service providing corporate customers with greater choice and flexibility in managing their ongoing business expenses.

Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n15 January 2025\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\n2024 Full Year Trading Update\nand Notice of Investor Presentation\nSignificant strategic progress and growth in all key financial metrics\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN),\na foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform\n, is pleased to provide an unaudited update on trading for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nUnderlying revenue1 grew by c. 26% to \u00a311.3m (2023: \u00a38.9m) and reported revenue increased by c. 19% to \u00a311.4m (2023: \u00a39.6m)\n\u00b7\nGrowth in active customers2 to 1,059 (2023: 906)\n\u00b7\nGross margin improved to c. 65.5% (2023: 63.4%)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted\n3\nEBITDA increased by c. 18% to \u00a32.0m (2023: \u00a31.7m)\n\u00b7\nCash flows from operating activities of c. \u00a32.2m (2023: \u00a32.0m)\n\u00b7\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2024 of c. \u00a32.6m (31 December 2023: \u00a32.3m)\nThe strong trading momentum that was experienced in H1 2024 was sustained and continued through to the year-end. As a result, the Group expects to report an increase in underlying revenue\n1\nfor FY 2024 of approximately 26% to \u00a311.3m (2023: \u00a38.9m) and growth in reported revenue of approximately 19% to \u00a311.4m (2023: \u00a39.6m). This growth was driven by an increase in active customers to 1,059 (2023: 906) reflecting the Group's expansion of its sales team and introducer network and sustained focus on providing an exceptional level of service to its corporate and high net worth individual (\"HNWI\") clients.\nBy client type, the Group saw an increase in revenue generated by both private clients (primarily HNWIs) and corporate accounts. The proportion of total revenue accounted for by private clients was 59% (2023: 64%) with corporate accounts contributing 40% (2023: 34%). In respect of the majority of private client revenue, whilst the underlying transaction is with an individual, the relationship is via a corporate that provides services to the individual. In addition, the Group received \u00a3100k (2023: \u00a3220k) in revenue, accounting for 1% of total revenue (2023: 2%), as the final income generated under a licencing agreement with the acquirers of Avila House, a former subsidiary of the Group.\nThe Group expects to report a further improvement in gross margin to c. 65.5% for 2024 (2023: 63.4%), primarily reflecting the strategic decision to offboard the historic white label business in prior years.\nAdjusted3 EBITDA is expected to increase to c. \u00a32.0m for 2024 (2023: \u00a31.7m). This growth reflects the increase in revenue as well as the Group continuing to benefit from the operating leverage offered by its highly scalable platform.\nCash generated from operating activities was c. \u00a32.2m (2023: \u00a32.0m). Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2024 increased to \u00a32.6m (31 December 2023: \u00a32.3m) resulting in net cash4 of \u00a30.6m (31 December 2023: \u00a30.2m).\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"This has been a milestone year for our company as we undertook several significant strategic initiatives while continuing to deliver strong growth. We have expanded our offering, our sales team and our introducer network resulting in an increased number of customers. This has enabled us to achieve growth in all key financial metrics in 2024. At the same time, our agreement with Mastercard, establishing a presence in Canada and adopting 'Finseta' as our new company name have strengthened our business and our ability to deliver value. Accordingly, we have entered 2025 with confidence and we look forward to reporting on further progress.\"\nInvestor Presentation\nThe Group gives notice that James Hickman, CEO, and Judy Happe, CFO, will be presenting via Investor Meet Company on 21 January 2025 at 9.30am GMT to provide investors with an update on the Group's trading for 2024 and its strategic progress.\nQuestions can be submitted pre-event via the Investor Meet Company platform up until 9.00am GMT the day before the meeting or at any time during the live presentation.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add to meet\u202fFinseta\u202fvia:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/finseta-plc/register-investor\nNotes\n1\nDefined as total revenue excluding revenue generated by the Group's historic white label business in 2023 and licencing revenue under an exceptional agreement in 2023 and 2024\n2\nDefined as customers who traded through Finseta during the 12-month periods to 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 respectively\n3\nAdjusted to exclude share-based compensation, transaction costs, depreciation & amortisation charges, profit from the disposal of a s",

Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n9 July 2024\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nH1 2024 Trading Update\nStrong H1 2024 performance and on track to report significant growth for FY 2024\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN),\na foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform\n, is pleased to provide an unaudited update on trading for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (\"H1 2024\").\nH1 2024 Highlights\n\u00b7\nRevenue increased by c. 42% to c. \u00a35.1m (H1 2023: \u00a33.6m)\n\u00b7\nGrowth in active customers1\u00a0to 952 (H1 2023: 874) and increase in average transaction value\n\u00b7\nGross margin improved to c. 65% (H1 2023: 61.0%)\n\u00b7\nAdj. EBITDA\n2\nincreased by c. 300% to c. \u00a30.8m (H1 2023: \u00a30.2m)\n\u00b7\nCashflow generated from operations of c. \u00a30.7m (H1 2023: \u00a30.1m)\n\u00b7\nStrong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2024 of \u00a32.8m (31 December 2023: \u00a32.3m)\n\u00b7\nOn track to report significant revenue growth for full year 2024 in line with the Board's expectations\nAs noted in the Group's full year results announcement on 8 May 2024, the strong trading momentum that was experienced in 2023 had been sustained into the current year, and this continued through H1 2024. As a result, the Group expects to report an increase in revenue for H1 2024 of approximately 42%, to \u00a35.1m (H1 2023: \u00a33.6m). This significant growth was driven by an increase in active customers to 952 (H1 2023: 874) as well as an increase in average transaction value, reflecting the Group's expansion of its sales team and introducer network and an increased focus on providing an exceptional level of service to its corporate and high net worth individual (\"HNWI\") clients.\nThe Group expects to report an improvement in gross margin to c. 65% for H1 2024 (H1 2023: 61.0%). This is primarily due to the Group no longer deriving revenue from white label partners following its strategic decision to manage down its historic white label business. On an underlying basis, to exclude revenue generated by white label partners in H1 2023, the Group's revenue grew by c. 54% in H1 2024 over H1 2023. Revenue by client type remained stable, with HNWI customers accounting for 61% and corporate customers for 39% (H1 2023: 62% and 38%, respectively).\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be c. \u00a30.8m for the first half of 2014 (H1 2023: \u00a30.2m). This growth reflects the increase in revenue as well as the Group beginning to benefit from the operating leverage offered by its highly scalable platform. Cashflow generated from operations was c. \u00a30.7m (H1 2023: \u00a30.1m), with the Group generating a total net cash inflow of c. \u00a30.4m for the H1 2024 period (H1 2023: \u00a30.1m). Accordingly, cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2024 increased to \u00a32.8m (31 December 2023: \u00a32.3m).\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"This has been another excellent period of delivery for Finseta, with substantial growth in revenue and EBTIDA as we continued to increase our number of customers and average transaction value. This reflects our success in executing on our strategy to expand our introducer network and payments capabilities while maintaining the high level of customer service for which we are known. Alongside this, we continued to strengthen our business and drivers of future growth with the important progress made in establishing a presence in Canada and with our card programme. Accordingly, and with the strong trading momentum being sustained, we remain on track to deliver significant growth for FY 2024 in line with the Board's expectations and look to the future with great confidence.\n\"\nThe Group will provide further information on its H1 2024 performance in its interim results announcement, which is scheduled to be published on 10 September 2024.\n1\nDefined as customers who traded through Finseta during the 12-month periods to 30 June 2024 and 2023 respectively\n2\nAdjusted to exclude share-based compensation, transaction costs, depreciation & amortisation charges, profit from the disposal of a subsidiary, other operating income related to interest on client balances and non-cash based accounting adjustments in respect of the Group's corporate premises\nFor further information, please contact:\nFinseta plc\nJames Hickman, Chief Executive Officer\nJudy Happe, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nShore Capital (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nDaniel Bush / Tom Knibbs (Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)207 408 4090\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\nHarry Chathli / Claire Norbury\n+44 (0)204 582 3500\nAbout Finseta plc\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN) is a foreign exchan",

Finablr Limited owns the entire remainder of the Company's group (the \"Target Group\" and the \"Transaction\"). The Transaction will constitute the sale by the Company of its entire business and operations. Prism has formed a consortium with Abu Dhabi's Royal Strategic Partners (\"RSP\") in connection with the Transaction, as further described below.\nTerms of the Transaction\nThe completion of the Transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.\nIn return for the transfer of the Target Group to GFIH, in addition to the nominal initial consideration of US$1 payable, GFIH is providing working capital support to the Target Group to enable it to continue to operate and to support various stakeholders in the Target Group, including employees and creditors of the Target Group. In addition, GFIH will undertake to support and facilitate the Company's continued efforts to recover funds from third parties in respect of possible historic wrongdoing within the Group. In this regard, subject to certain conditions, the Company and GFIH have agreed that GFIH shall pay to the Company, by way of additional consideration, a further amount equal to 25 per cent of any such funds received by the Target Group from third parties, up to a maximum of US$190,000,000. GFIH has also agreed certain provisions with the Company relating to the coordination of efforts to investigate possible historic wrong doing within the Target Group.\nThe Company intends to use the nominal consideration and any further consideration received to return value to its creditors, followed by its shareholders. Given the circumstances of the Company and the fact that absent the proposed funding from GFIH the Company will have insufficient working capital the Board of the Company believes that the Transaction is in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company.\nStrategic rationale\nPrism has formed a consortium with Abu Dhabi's RSP to rescue and rebuild the UAE-based financial services company, Finablr. Together, Prism aims to work with all stakeholders to revitalise the Target Group, which was a core pillar for cross border financial services in the UAE, providing currency exchange and remittance solutions that supported thousands of businesses and millions of customers around the world.\nPrism and RSP are building a highly experienced executive management team to help lead the proposed transformation of Finablr. Through this transformation, Prism intends to create a world-leading, financial services platform for the emerging and frontier markets.\nPrism and RSP believe they have a strong network within the key public and private sectors, which will bring tangible value and support to our all stakeholders including clients, employees, regulators, suppliers and third-party vendors.\nPrism and RSP are working with established advisors to help find the optimal solution for the near-term and long-term benefit of the Target Group. Prism has retained Kirkland & Ellis, White & Case and Druces LLP as legal counsel, and a global restructuring firm as financial advisers.\nPrism and RSP look forward to engaging with all stakeholders in connection with the proposed restructuring of the Target Group.\nEND\nEnquiries\nBhairav Trivedi, Group Chief Executive Officer,\nbhairav.trivedi@finablr.com\nTel +1 (484) 358-7357\nRob Miller, Group HR and Restructuring Implementation Director, robert.miller@finablr.com Tel +44 7801 663858\nFor more information, visit the Finablr website:\nwww.finablr.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

At this point it becomes even more important imho the strategy for further expanding the business (new jurisdictions, new monetizable products) in order to diversify business risk from the overall economic environment which is against Finseta at the moment and for the foreseable future. A bullish 2H expecation carries now a lighter weight after 1H results landed short of expectations. Don't expect the SP to go anywhere for the time being (maybe a little further down after today's major selloff) until FY results or unless of some major news releases. Growth now seems to have normalized to a 15-30% y-o-y which doesn't command the multiple that FIN was trading last year when growth was well above 50% y-o-y. Things may just be delayed as per the update, but i don't think there's enough confidence right now to push SP higher. Just mho",

I don\u2019t progress so a market update would be welcomed right now  as this has drifted lower and lower\u2026. Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

At this point it becomes even more important imho the strategy for further expanding the business (new jurisdictions, new monetizable products) in order to diversify business risk from the overall economic environment which is against Finseta at the moment and for the foreseable future. A bullish 2H expecation carries now a lighter weight after 1H results landed short of expectations. Don't expect the SP to go anywhere for the time being (maybe a little further down after today's major selloff) until FY results or unless of some major news releases. Growth now seems to have normalized to a 15-30% y-o-y which doesn't command the multiple that FIN was trading last year when growth was well above 50% y-o-y. Things may just be delayed as per the update, but i don't think there's enough confidence right now to push SP higher. Just mho",

I don\u2019t progress so a market update would be welcomed right now  as this has drifted lower and lower\u2026. Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

At this point it becomes even more important imho the strategy for further expanding the business (new jurisdictions, new monetizable products) in order to diversify business risk from the overall economic environment which is against Finseta at the moment and for the foreseable future. A bullish 2H expecation carries now a lighter weight after 1H results landed short of expectations. Don't expect the SP to go anywhere for the time being (maybe a little further down after today's major selloff) until FY results or unless of some major news releases. Growth now seems to have normalized to a 15-30% y-o-y which doesn't command the multiple that FIN was trading last year when growth was well above 50% y-o-y. Things may just be delayed as per the update, but i don't think there's enough confidence right now to push SP higher. Just mho",

I don\u2019t progress so a market update would be welcomed right now  as this has drifted lower and lower\u2026. Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

At this point it becomes even more important imho the strategy for further expanding the business (new jurisdictions, new monetizable products) in order to diversify business risk from the overall economic environment which is against Finseta at the moment and for the foreseable future. A bullish 2H expecation carries now a lighter weight after 1H results landed short of expectations. Don't expect the SP to go anywhere for the time being (maybe a little further down after today's major selloff) until FY results or unless of some major news releases. Growth now seems to have normalized to a 15-30% y-o-y which doesn't command the multiple that FIN was trading last year when growth was well above 50% y-o-y. Things may just be delayed as per the update, but i don't think there's enough confidence right now to push SP higher. Just mho",

I don\u2019t progress so a market update would be welcomed right now  as this has drifted lower and lower\u2026. Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

At this point it becomes even more important imho the strategy for further expanding the business (new jurisdictions, new monetizable products) in order to diversify business risk from the overall economic environment which is against Finseta at the moment and for the foreseable future. A bullish 2H expecation carries now a lighter weight after 1H results landed short of expectations. Don't expect the SP to go anywhere for the time being (maybe a little further down after today's major selloff) until FY results or unless of some major news releases. Growth now seems to have normalized to a 15-30% y-o-y which doesn't command the multiple that FIN was trading last year when growth was well above 50% y-o-y. Things may just be delayed as per the update, but i don't think there's enough confidence right now to push SP higher. Just mho",

Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

At this point it becomes even more important imho the strategy for further expanding the business (new jurisdictions, new monetizable products) in order to diversify business risk from the overall economic environment which is against Finseta at the moment and for the foreseable future. A bullish 2H expecation carries now a lighter weight after 1H results landed short of expectations. Don't expect the SP to go anywhere for the time being (maybe a little further down after today's major selloff) until FY results or unless of some major news releases. Growth now seems to have normalized to a 15-30% y-o-y which doesn't command the multiple that FIN was trading last year when growth was well above 50% y-o-y. Things may just be delayed as per the update, but i don't think there's enough confidence right now to push SP higher. Just mho",

Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",

It's worth reading as it explains in detail why they expect net profits to fall in 2025 despite revenue rising. Beyond that they expect significant growth, up to 7.6p EPS in 2027. That's a forward PE of just over 3 from the share price right now, if you are OK with waiting 2-3 years.",

At this point it becomes even more important imho the strategy for further expanding the business (new jurisdictions, new monetizable products) in order to diversify business risk from the overall economic environment which is against Finseta at the moment and for the foreseable future. A bullish 2H expecation carries now a lighter weight after 1H results landed short of expectations. Don't expect the SP to go anywhere for the time being (maybe a little further down after today's major selloff) until FY results or unless of some major news releases. Growth now seems to have normalized to a 15-30% y-o-y which doesn't command the multiple that FIN was trading last year when growth was well above 50% y-o-y. Things may just be delayed as per the update, but i don't think there's enough confidence right now to push SP higher. Just mho",

I don\u2019t progress so a market update would be welcomed right now  as this has drifted lower and lower\u2026. Current Trading and Outlook \u00b7 Following the previously announced delays to some payment transactions in H1 2025, the Group has experienced an improvement in its USD-related business as FX rates normalise, albeit, to date, to a lesser extent than previously anticipated. As a result, the Board is taking a more cautious view of the full year and now expects to report year-on-year revenue growth for FY 2025 of c. 11% \u00b7 Cost discipline is being maintained and total operating costs are anticipated to be slightly lower than initially expected for FY 2025 \u00b7 In the medium term, the strategic actions that the Group has taken position Finseta to substantially accelerate sales growth and increase profitability James Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said: \"This has been another period of significant strategic delivery for Finseta. We have invested in several initiatives that are diversifying our revenue streams and position us for sustainable growth. We are already experiencing the benefits of this strategy, which is set to accelerate our sales and increase our profit in the medium term. While our revenue growth has been constrained by global macroeconomic factors, particularly the impact on foreign exchange rates of US trade policy, it is pleasing to see more positive momentum as we progress through H2, albeit to a lesser extent than initially expected. In addition, we are particularly excited about the prospects for our Dubai operation, which is performing ahead of our expectations and will make an important contribution to our expected revenue growth for the full year. Accordingly, with the foundations of our business having been further enhanced, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained value for our shareholders.\" BRV Capricorn",
