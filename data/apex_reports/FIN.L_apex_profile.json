Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n15 January 2026\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\n2025 Full Year Trading Update\nFinseta (AIM: FIN), a foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform, provides the following update on trading for the year ended 31 December 2025 (\"FY 2025\").\nThe Group expects to report FY 2025 revenue of \u00a312.4m (FY 2024: \u00a311.4m), an increase of 9%, reflecting growth in both active customers to 1,1011 (FY 2024: 1,059) and average revenue per customer. After receiving regulatory approval in March 2025 to provide payment services in the United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\"), the Group achieved significant growth in its Dubai operation, ahead of the Board's initial expectations, and consequently invested further in the sales team to support accelerated future growth in the region. Together with further expansion of the UK sales teams in 2025, the Group also saw strong growth in business with corporate clients in the UK. Total revenues from corporate clients increased by 54% compared with FY 2024 and represented 57% of FY 2025 Group revenues (FY 2024: 41%). The growth in revenues from Dubai and from corporate clients served to largely mitigate the impact of the previously-reported effects on foreign exchange rates and the global economy of tariff-related developments, which continued to constrain active customer conversion and payments activity during the second half of the year, particularly amongst high net worth individual (\"HNWI\") clients.\nThe Group's gross margin is expected to be approximately 61% (FY 2024: 65.7%), as a result of the greater weighting towards corporate clients in the FY 2025 revenue mix. Whilst corporate client gross margins are lower than HNWIs, corporate clients typically transact more regularly and provide greater revenue recurrence.\nDuring 2025 the business made substantial strategic and operational progress, with the receipt of regulatory approval to provide payments services in the UAE, the establishment of a full-service office in Canada, the launch of the Finseta Corporate Card scheme, the establishment of new counterparty partnerships and the implementation of UK agency banking in Q3, which enables Finseta to issue its own account numbers and connect indirectly to the Faster Payments System. The Group made planned investments in FY 2025 to support these activities and position Finseta to benefit from expanded geographical and market reach, and a broader product and service offering, which it believes will lead to accelerated sales growth and increased profitability in the medium term. Whilst doing so, Finseta has maintained cost discipline with total operating costs for the year anticipated to be in line with the Board's expectations at the time of the interim results in September 2025. As a result of the planned investment in sales, compliance and overhead functions, and trading conditions during FY 2025, the Group expects to report adjusted EBITDA2 of approximately \u00a30.1m (FY 2024: \u00a32.0m).\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2025 were \u00a31.5m (31 December 2024: \u00a32.6m) resulting in net debt3 of \u00a30.3m (31 December 2024: net cash of \u00a30.6m). This primarily reflects reduced operating cash flow in FY 2025 and a cash outflow from investing activities of approximately \u00a31.1m (FY 2024: \u00a31.3m), on account of the Group's planned investment in its strategic growth initiatives, which will support growth in future periods. The Group expects to return to cash flow generation in H2 2026.\nJames Hickman, CEO of Finseta, said:\n\"2025 was a year of substantial strategic progress. We delivered against all of our strategic objectives for the year - most notably with the ramp up of our operation in Dubai and completing the implementation of UK agency banking. While our revenue growth was constrained by macroeconomic factors, the strategic progress and investments we made during the year position us to broaden our offering,\naccelerate sales growth and increase profitability in the medium term.\n\"\nInvestor Presentation\nFinseta plc is pleased to announce that James Hickman, CEO, and Judy Happe, CFO, will provide a live presentation relating to the 2025 Full Year Trading Update via Investor Meet Company on 22 January 2026 at 9.30am GMT.\nThe presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders.

Upon publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n13 November 2025\nFinseta plc\n(\"Finseta\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nVariation of Loan Note & Incentivisation Arrangements\nPDMR Dealings and Total Voting Rights\nFinseta (AIM: FIN), a foreign exchange and payments solutions company offering multi-currency accounts to businesses and individuals through its proprietary technology platform, is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to vary the terms of certain incentivisation and compensation arrangements with, and the terms of a loan note (the \"Loan Note\") held by, Robert O'Brien, Chief Commercial Officer.\nFurther to its announcements of 4 August 2022 and 8 March 2023, the Company and Mr O'Brien have agreed to convert \u00a3200k of the \u00a32m principal Loan Note into ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\"), and to extend the repayment date of the remaining \u00a31.8m Loan Note principal from 31 July 2026 to 31 December 2028. A conversion price of 19 pence per Ordinary Share has been used for the \u00a3200k Loan Note conversion, which represents a 35.7 per cent. premium to the closing price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on AIM on 12 November 2025. The Company's ability to elect for early repayment of the remainder of the Loan Note has been retained. The Loan Note coupon has been amended to 8.5 per cent. from 6.0 per cent., to reflect increases in the Bank of England's Bank Rate since the coupon was last set in August 2022.\nIn addition, Mr O'Brien has agreed to vary certain elements of his compensation package, including decreasing his commission share on certain revenue streams with effect from 1 February 2026. This, alongside the amended Loan Note terms, is expected to be cash flow beneficial for the Company in future years.\nAs Chief Commercial Officer and a substantial shareholder, the Board believes that the amendment of the terms of the Loan Note and Mr O'Brien's incentivisation and compensation arrangements reflect his strong support and alignment in prioritising the deployment of Finseta's resources to drive growth. Whilst the Company held cash and cash equivalents of \u00a32.3m as at 12 November 2025, and has no financial debt other than the Loan Note, the variations agreed with Mr O'Brien provide the Company with greater flexibility to continue to invest in its three-pillar growth strategy.\nAs Mr O'Brien is classified as a substantial shareholder for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"), the variation of the terms of the Loan Note held by, and the incentivisation arrangements with, Mr O'Brien constitute a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. The Company's Directors consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, Shore Capital, that the terms of these variations are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nIssue of Ordinary Shares and Total Voting Rights\nThe Company has issued and allotted 1,052,632 new Ordinary Shares to Mr O'Brien, at a price of 19 pence per Ordinary Share, in respect of the conversion of \u00a3200k of the Loan Note principal. Following this issuance, Mr O'Brien has an interest in 10,452,632 Ordinary Shares, representing 17.7 per cent. of the Company's enlarged issued share capital.\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 1,052,632 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\") and it is expected that Admission will become effective at 8:00 a.m. on or around 19 November 2025. The new Ordinary\u00a0Shares\u00a0will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing issued Ordinary Shares in the Company.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 59,019,733. The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. The figure of 59,019,733 may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nEnquiries\nFinseta plc\n+44 (0)203 971 4865\nJames Hickman, Chief Executive Officer\nJudy Happe, Chief Financial Officer\nShore Capital (N\nominated Adviser and\nBroker)\n+44 (0)207 408 4090\nDaniel Bush, Tom Knibbs (Corporate Advisory)\nGuy Wiehahn (Corporate Broking)\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\n+44 (0)204 582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Claire Norbury\nAbout Finseta plc\nFinseta plc (AIM: FIN) is a foreign exchange and payments company offering multi-currency accounts and payment solutions to businesses and individuals.
