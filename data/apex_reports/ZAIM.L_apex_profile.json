Basis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards and in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements set out above do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors on 24 December 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditor, RPG Crouch Chapman LLP.\nGoing concern\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors consider that the Company requires additional funding in order to deliver on its plan to find and acquire an operating business and undertake a reverse take over. The Directors are of the view that its current cash reserves along with any funding that it will seek to raise would provide sufficient funds to undertake its operating activities for the foreseeable future. Should the company be unsuccessful in raising additional capital then there is a significant risk that it has the ability to continue as a going concern. The company has currently reduced its cash expenditure to a minimum.\nPlease refer to the going concern note in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024 for further information.\n2.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2024, and of its loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs); and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to the going concern note in the accounting policies, concerning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe matters explained indicate that the base case forecast for the Company requires short term working capital funding from the principal stakeholder. It also indicates that the Company needs to raise further funds to enable the Company to invest in future ventures currently planned for early 2026.\nThese events or conditions along with the matters set forth in in the accounting policies indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nWe have highlighted going concern as a key audit matter. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included (but not limited to):\n\u00b7\nReview of managements cash flow projections for a period of 12 months following approval of the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nReview of management's assumptions based on historical expenditure and contractual commitments;\n\u00b7\nSensitivity analysis on cash flow forecast to consider the available headroom under different reasonably possible scenarios;\n\u00b7\nConsideration of certainty of receipt of additional funding from stakeholders including precedent on agreements; and\n\u00b7\nReview of adequacy and completeness of disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the going concern assumption.\nOur approach to the audit\nIn planning our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to issue an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nIn addition to the use of the Going Concern basis described in the material uncertainty related to going concern section, we have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.\nKey audit matter\nHow our work addressed this matter\nManagement override of controls\nThere is a presumed risk that management is able to override controls.\nOur audit work included, but was not restricted to:\n\u00b7\nJournals testing, including completeness of journal review, reviewing journals posted during and after the year end for any activity that is not in line with our knowledge;\n\u00b7\nReviewing management estimations, judgements and application of accounting policies for undue bias in the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nReviewing unadjusted audit differences for indications of bias of a deliberate misstatement; and\n\u00b7\nApplying professional scepticism in our audit procedures.\nShares in advance reserve\nDuring the year the company received funding from investors in exchange for a future issue of shares, this \"Shares in Advance\" amount is complex in nature and is therefore more likely to be misstated.\nOur audit work included, but was not restricted to:\n\u2022\nVouching stated amounts to bank receipts from investors;\n\u2022\nAgreeing amounts to signed subscription agreements;\n\u2022\nEnsuring amounts are correctly classified in accordance with IFRS accounting standards; and\n\u2022\nEnsuring cut off is correctly treated.\nOur application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. We consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nIn order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.\nWe consider net assets to be the most significant determinant of the Company's financial performance used by the users of the financial statements. We have based materiality on 4% of net assets for the Company. Overall materiality for the Company was therefore set at \u00a342,900.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for the Company. This enables us to form an opinion on the financial statements. We take into accounts size, risk profile, the organisation of the Company and the internal control environment when assessing the level of work to be performed.\nBased on our assessment of the accounting process, the industry in which the company operates and the control environment, it was appropriate to undertake an entirely substantive audit approach. Our substantive audit procedures included testing of total expenditure, total assets, liabilities and equity.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u00b7\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u00b7\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks within which the Company operates focusing on those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The laws and regulations we considered in this context were the Companies Act 2006 and relevant taxation legislation.\n\u00b7\nWe identified the greatest risk of material impact on the financial statements from irregularities, including fraud, to be the override of controls by management. Our audit procedures to respond to these risks included enquiries of management about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities, sample testing on the posting of journals and reviewing accounting estimates for biases.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.\nA further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nOther matters that we are required to address\nWe confirm that we are independent of the Company and have not provided any prohibited non-audit services, as defined by the Ethical Standard issued by the Financial Report Council.\nOur audit report is consistent with our additional report to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors explaining the results of our audit.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nPaul Randall FCA (Senior Statutory Auditor)For and on behalf of RPG Crouch Chapman LLP\nChartered AccountantsStatutory Auditors40 Gracechurch StreetLondonEC3V 0BT\nDate: 24th December 2025\nSTATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR\nE\nNDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\nNote\n2024\n\u00a3\n2023\n\u00a3\nStaff costs\n(184,536)\n(227,459)\nOperating expenses\n7\n(212,100)\n(216,877)\nProfit/(Loss)\nbefore income tax\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nIncome tax expense\n9\n-\nNet loss\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nNet other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation into presentation currency\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive expense\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nEarnings per share\n6\nBasic, loss for the year attributable to\nordinary equity holders of the parent\n(0.77p) (0.95p)\nDiluted, loss for the year attributable to\nordinary equity holders of the parent (\n0.77p)\n(0.95\np)\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2024\nRegistered number:\n11418575\nNote\n2024\n20\n23\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,823\n58,116\nTotal assets\n1,823\n58,116\nLiabilities\nOther liabilities\n10\n859,354\n632,947\nAdvanced subscriptions for shares\n10\n83,956\n-\nLoan\n29,980\n-\nTotal liabilities\n973,290\n632,947\nEquity\nShare capital\n5\n513,475\n513,475\nDeferred share capital\n4,157,775\n4,157,775\nShare Premium\n6,910,128\n6,910,128\nShare options reserve\n9,672\n119,640\nAccumulated deficit\n(12,562,517)\n(12,275,849)\nTotal equity\n(971,467)\n(574,831)\nTotal liabilities and equity\n1,823\n58,116\nThe above Company Statement of Financial Position should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.\nThe Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24th December 2025 and were signed on its behalf\nSiro Donato Cicconi,\nChief Executive Officer\nMalcolm Groat,\nChairman\nSTATEMENT OF\nCHANGES IN EQUITY\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\nShare capital\n\u00a3\nDeferred Share Capital\n\u00a3\nShare premium\n\u00a3\nAccumulated deficit\n\u00a3\nShare options reserve\n\u00a3\nTotalequity\n\u00a3\nBalance at 31 December 2022\n4,619,750\n-\n6,755,628\n(11,833,513)\n119,640\n(338,495)\nShare consolidation\n(4,157,775)\n4,157,775\n-\nShare issue\n51,500\n-\n154,500\n206,000\nComprehensive loss\nfor 2023\n-\n-\n-\n(442,336)\n-\n(442,336)\nBalance at 31 December 2023\n513,475\n4,157,775\n6,910,128\n(12,275,849)\n119,640\n(574,831)\nShare consolidation\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCancelation of options\n-\n-\n-\n109,968\n(109,968)\n-\nComprehensive loss\nfor 2024\n-\n-\n-\n(396,636)\n-\n(396,636)\nBalance at 31 December 2024\n513,475\n4,157,775\n6,910,128\n(12,562,517)\n9,672\n(971,467)\nSTATEMENT OF\nCASH FLOW\nTHE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\n2024\n20\n23\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash flows from operating activities\nLoss for the period\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nCorrection for non-cash transaction\n-\nCash flows from/(used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nAdjustments for\nIncrease in trade and other receivables\n, VAT\n-\n(Decrease)/Increase in trade and other payables\n226,407\n258,984\nCash generated from operations\n(170,229)\n(183,352)\nNet cash flows used in operating activities\n(170,229)\n(183,352)\nCash flows from investing activities\nInvestment in subsidiary\n-\n-\nNet cash flows from investing activities\n-\n-\nCash flows from financing activities\nIssue of ordinary shares (including share premium)\n-\n206,000\nAdvanced subscription of shares\n83,956\nAdvancement of loan\n29,980\n-\nNet cash flows from financing activities\n113,936\n206,000\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n(56,293)\n22,648\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year\n58,116\n35,468\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the year\n1,823\n58,116\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS\nFOR THE\nYEAR\nENDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\n1.\nGeneral Information\nThe Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales as a public company limited by shares on 15 June 2018 under the Companies Act 2006, with the name Agana Holdings Plc, and registered number 11418575. On 22 July 2019, the Company changed its name to Zaim Credit Systems Plc. On 23 March 2023, the Company changed its name to Adalan Ventures Plc.\nThe Company's registered office is located at 10 Orange Street, London, United Kingdom, WC2H 7DQ.\n2.\nPrincipal activities\nAs at 31 December 2024, the principal activity of the Company was to seek acquisition opportunities. The Company expects that consideration for the Acquisition will primarily be satisfied by issue of new Shares to a vendor (or vendors), but that some cash may also be payable by the Company. Any funds not used in connection with the Acquisition will be used for future acquisitions, internal or external growth and expansion, and working capital in relation to the acquired company or business.\nFollowing completion of the Acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its Shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, the Company intends to seek re-admission of the enlarged group to listing on the Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange or admission to another stock exchange.\n3.\nAccounting policies\n3.1\nBasis of Preparation\nThe Company has not yet commenced business and no dividends have been declared or paid since the date of incorporation.\nThe historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom.\nThe historical financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling (\"\u00a3\"), which is the Company's functional and presentational currency and has been prepared under the historical cost convention.\n3.2\nGoing concern\nThe accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Company generated a loss for the year of \u00a3393,636 and as at 31 December 2024 had net liabilities of \u00a3971,467.\nAs a result of the above, the Directors have reviewed the Company's expected operational results and cash requirements for the year from the date of these accounts. The company is dependent on the success of future fundraising in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The company is also in the process of seeking additional funding in order to purse its strategy of making an acquisition to seek re-admission of the enlarged group to listing on the Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange or admission to another stock exchange.\nShould the raising of new capital be unsuccessful then the Company faces significant uncertainty over its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has reduced its cash expenditure to a minimum and obtained short-term finance during the period of delay in completing any such fundraising to allow the Company to work on the re-capitalisation of the business. The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nHowever, as at the date of approval of these financial statements, there are no legally binding agreements in place in relation to any fundraising or extension of terms with creditors and as the success of any finance raising is outside the control of the company there can be no certainty that additional funds will be forthcoming, which indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in\nthe normal course of business. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.\n.\n3.3\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are recognized in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nFinancial assets are classified into specified categories. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of recognition.\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, other than those classified\nas\nfair value through the income statement, which are measured at fair value.\nTrade and other\nreceivables\nTrade receivables are recognized and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is considered to be remote.\nImpairment of financial\nassets\nFinancial assets, other than those at fair value through the income statement, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date\n.\nFinancial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.\nDerecognition of financial\nassets\nFinancial assets are derecognized only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the\nasset\nexpire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially\nall the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n3.4\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement or other financial liabilities.\nFinancial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when, and only when, the company's obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.\nTaxation\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realized. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers any cash on short-term deposits and other short term investments to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of financial position.\nShare based payments\nThe Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Company. The fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of share options are recognised as an expense. The total expense to be apportioned over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:\n\u00b7\nincluding any market performance conditions;\n\u00b7\nexcluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and\n\u00b7\nincluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.\nNon-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest.\nIt recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\nWhen options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.\nThe fair value of goods or services received in exchange for shares is recognised as an expense.\nForeign currency\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where such items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.\nGains and losses on purchase and sale of foreign currency are determined as a difference between the selling price and the carrying amount at the date of the transaction.\nShare capital\nShare capital comprises the nominal value paid for each share. Any premium paid over and above the nominal value is allocated to share premium, which is recorded net of any transaction specific costs.\n4.\nStandards and interpretations issued but not yet applied\nThe Company has not yet commenced business and no dividends have been declared or paid since the date of incorporation.\nThe historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom.\nThe historical financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling (\"\u00a3\"), which is the Company's functional and presentational currency and has been prepared under the historical cost convention.\nStandards and interpretations issued but not yet applied\nAt the date of authorisation of this financial information, the Directors have reviewed the Standards in issue by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") and IFRIC, which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after the stated effective date. In their view, none of these standards would have a material impact on the financial reporting of the Company.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income, expenditure, assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated, including expectations of future events to ensure these estimates to be reasonable.The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that\nare believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The Company's nature of operations is to act as a special purpose acquisition Company. This significantly reduces the level of estimates and assumptions required.The going concern status of the Company is considered to be a key judgement. This has been considered further in note 2.1 to the financial statements\n5.\nShare\ncapital\nNumber\n\u00a3\nIssued and fully paid\n31 December 2023 and 2024\n51,347,500\n513,475\n6.\nEarnings per share\nBasic & diluted earnings per share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share information for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share are determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the year\nWeighted average shares in issue\n(396,636)\n51,347,500\n(442,336)\n46,734,082\nBasic and diluted Earnings/(loss) per share (Pence)\n(0.77)\n(0.95)\nAs the Company was loss making in both periods the basic and diluted earnings per share are derived from using only the undiluted shares in issue with no effect for potential dilution resulting in the figures presented as the same for both measures.\nThe number of shares used to denominate the weighted average shares in issue has been adjusted in the prior year to account for the share consolidation which happened during the current year.\n7.\nOperating Expenses\n2024\n\u00a3\n20\n23\n\u00a3\nConsulting services\n9,000\n10,800\nCommunication\n-\n1,518\nBanking services\n1,049\n474\nInvestor Relations\n132,764\n25,169\nOther expenses\n69,287\n178,916\nTotal operating expenses\n212,100\n216,877\nOperating expenses include the cost of audit for the company of \u00a321,000 (2023: \u00a320,000).

This involves the commencement of trading in the company shares and issuance of a prospectus and or authority to allot shares being granted by shareholders at a general meeting and the annual authority to allot shares as determined by the FCA (currently 19.99%, due to increase to 75% on 19th January 2025).

The Company's accounting policies and method adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial assets, financial liability and equity instrument are set out in Note 2. The Company do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe principal financial instruments used by the Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nFinancial Assets\nLoans and receivables\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,823\n58,116\nTotal Financial Assets\n1,823\n58,116\nFinancial Liabilities measured at amortised cost\nTrade Payables\n99,783\n47,647\nTotal financial liabilities\n99,783\n47,647\nThere are no financial assets that are either past due or impaired.\n13.\nShare Based Payments\nNumber of options and warrants outstanding\nWeighted Average exercise price\n(p)\nOutstanding as at 31 December 2022\n20,150,000\n2.50\nShare consolidation\n2,015,000\n25.0\nIssued\n-\n-\nForfeited & cancelled\n-\n-\nOutstanding as at 31 December 2023\n2,015,000\n25.0\nForfeited & cancelled\n1,815,000\n25.0\nOutstanding as at 31 December 2024\n200,000\n27.0\n14.\nCapital management policy\nThe Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The capital structure of the Company consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued share capital and reserves.\n15.\nFinancial risk management\nThe Company uses a limited number of financial instruments, comprising cash and other payables, which arise directly from operations. The Company does not trade in financial instruments.\nFinancial risk factors\nThe Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash \ufb02ow interest rate risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance.\nCurrency risk\nThe Company does not operate internationally and its exposure to foreign exchange risk is limited to the transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling.\nCredit risk\nThe Company does not have any major concentrations of credit risk related to any individual customer or counterparty. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group has taken necessary steps and precautions in minimising the credit risk by lodging cash and cash equivalents only with reputable licensed banks.\nLiquidity risk\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the Company ensures it has adequate resource to discharge all its liabilities. The directors have considered the liquidity risk as part of their going concern assessment. (See note 2). At the date of approval of the financial statements there was a material uncertainty in relation to liquidity risk.\nCash flow interest rate risk\nThe Company has no significant interest-bearing liabilities and assets. The Company monitors the interest rate on its interest bearing assets closely to ensure favourable rates are secured.\nFair values\nManagement assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n16.\nUltimate Controlling Party\nThe ultimate controlling party is Zaim Holding SA which holds 69.2% of the share capital. Siro Cicconi, the Director of the Company is the ultimate beneficial owner of Zaim Holding SA, which he wholly owns through his life interest in Excelsior Foundation which wholly owns Zaim Holding SA\n17.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company received further advanced subscriptions for shares following the period end totaling \u00a3200,000. The shares are expected to be issued following the lifting of suspension of the trading on the London Stock Exchange and publication of a prospectus.\n18.\nRelated Party Transactions\nAs at the 31 December 2024 the Company owed a certain director \u00a38,581 as a result of cash advanced to the Company. This loan is repayable on demand and carries no interest.\n19.\nNumber of employees\nThe average number of employees during the year was 3 (2023: 4) and comprised solely the Directors.\n20.\nReserves\nR\netained earnings represents accumulated profit and losses to date.\nShare based payment reserve holds the fair value of equity share based payment arrangements at the date of\nissue once these instruments have been vested.\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares issued.\nShare Premium represents the premium issued over and above the nominal value of shares that have been fully paid up.\nThe deferred share capital reserve represents the deferred share capital following the 10 for 1 share consolidation undertaken during the period. This share capital carries no voting or other rights what so ever.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements set out above do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023\nwere approved by the Board of Directors on 11 February 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditor, RPG Crouch Chapman LLP.\nGoing concern\nThe Financial Statements have been\nprepared on a going concern basis. T\nhe Directors consider that the Company requires additional funding in order to deliver on its plan to find and acquire an operating business and undertake a reverse take over. The Directors are of the view that its current cash reserves along with any funding that it will seek to raise would provide sufficient funds to undertake its operating activities for the foreseeable future. Should the company be unsuccessful in raising additional capital then there is a significant risk that it has the ability to continue as a going concern. The company has currently reduced its cash expenditure to a minimum.\nPlease refer to the going concern note in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2023 for further information.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
