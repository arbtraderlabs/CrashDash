Basis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards and in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements set out above do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors on 24 December 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditor, RPG Crouch Chapman LLP.\nGoing concern\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors consider that the Company requires additional funding in order to deliver on its plan to find and acquire an operating business and undertake a reverse take over. The Directors are of the view that its current cash reserves along with any funding that it will seek to raise would provide sufficient funds to undertake its operating activities for the foreseeable future. Should the company be unsuccessful in raising additional capital then there is a significant risk that it has the ability to continue as a going concern. The company has currently reduced its cash expenditure to a minimum.\nPlease refer to the going concern note in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024 for further information.\n2.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2024, and of its loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs); and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to the going concern note in the accounting policies, concerning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe matters explained indicate that the base case forecast for the Company requires short term working capital funding from the principal stakeholder. It also indicates that the Company needs to raise further funds to enable the Company to invest in future ventures currently planned for early 2026.\nThese events or conditions along with the matters set forth in in the accounting policies indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nWe have highlighted going concern as a key audit matter. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included (but not limited to):\n\u00b7\nReview of managements cash flow projections for a period of 12 months following approval of the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nReview of management's assumptions based on historical expenditure and contractual commitments;\n\u00b7\nSensitivity analysis on cash flow forecast to consider the available headroom under different reasonably possible scenarios;\n\u00b7\nConsideration of certainty of receipt of additional funding from stakeholders including precedent on agreements; and\n\u00b7\nReview of adequacy and completeness of disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the going concern assumption.\nOur approach to the audit\nIn planning our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to issue an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nIn addition to the use of the Going Concern basis described in the material uncertainty related to going concern section, we have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.\nKey audit matter\nHow our work addressed this matter\nManagement override of controls\nThere is a presumed risk that management is able to override controls.\nOur audit work included, but was not restricted to:\n\u00b7\nJournals testing, including completeness of journal review, reviewing journals posted during and after the year end for any activity that is not in line with our knowledge;\n\u00b7\nReviewing management estimations, judgements and application of accounting policies for undue bias in the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nReviewing unadjusted audit differences for indications of bias of a deliberate misstatement; and\n\u00b7\nApplying professional scepticism in our audit procedures.\nShares in advance reserve\nDuring the year the company received funding from investors in exchange for a future issue of shares, this \"Shares in Advance\" amount is complex in nature and is therefore more likely to be misstated.\nOur audit work included, but was not restricted to:\n\u2022\nVouching stated amounts to bank receipts from investors;\n\u2022\nAgreeing amounts to signed subscription agreements;\n\u2022\nEnsuring amounts are correctly classified in accordance with IFRS accounting standards; and\n\u2022\nEnsuring cut off is correctly treated.\nOur application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. We consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.\nIn order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.\nWe consider net assets to be the most significant determinant of the Company's financial performance used by the users of the financial statements. We have based materiality on 4% of net assets for the Company. Overall materiality for the Company was therefore set at \u00a342,900.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for the Company. This enables us to form an opinion on the financial statements. We take into accounts size, risk profile, the organisation of the Company and the internal control environment when assessing the level of work to be performed.\nBased on our assessment of the accounting process, the industry in which the company operates and the control environment, it was appropriate to undertake an entirely substantive audit approach. Our substantive audit procedures included testing of total expenditure, total assets, liabilities and equity.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u00b7\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u00b7\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks within which the Company operates focusing on those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The laws and regulations we considered in this context were the Companies Act 2006 and relevant taxation legislation.\n\u00b7\nWe identified the greatest risk of material impact on the financial statements from irregularities, including fraud, to be the override of controls by management. Our audit procedures to respond to these risks included enquiries of management about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities, sample testing on the posting of journals and reviewing accounting estimates for biases.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.\nA further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nOther matters that we are required to address\nWe confirm that we are independent of the Company and have not provided any prohibited non-audit services, as defined by the Ethical Standard issued by the Financial Report Council.\nOur audit report is consistent with our additional report to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors explaining the results of our audit.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nPaul Randall FCA (Senior Statutory Auditor)For and on behalf of RPG Crouch Chapman LLP\nChartered AccountantsStatutory Auditors40 Gracechurch StreetLondonEC3V 0BT\nDate: 24th December 2025\nSTATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR\nE\nNDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\nNote\n2024\n\u00a3\n2023\n\u00a3\nStaff costs\n(184,536)\n(227,459)\nOperating expenses\n7\n(212,100)\n(216,877)\nProfit/(Loss)\nbefore income tax\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nIncome tax expense\n9\n-\nNet loss\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nNet other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation into presentation currency\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive expense\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nEarnings per share\n6\nBasic, loss for the year attributable to\nordinary equity holders of the parent\n(0.77p) (0.95p)\nDiluted, loss for the year attributable to\nordinary equity holders of the parent (\n0.77p)\n(0.95\np)\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2024\nRegistered number:\n11418575\nNote\n2024\n20\n23\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,823\n58,116\nTotal assets\n1,823\n58,116\nLiabilities\nOther liabilities\n10\n859,354\n632,947\nAdvanced subscriptions for shares\n10\n83,956\n-\nLoan\n29,980\n-\nTotal liabilities\n973,290\n632,947\nEquity\nShare capital\n5\n513,475\n513,475\nDeferred share capital\n4,157,775\n4,157,775\nShare Premium\n6,910,128\n6,910,128\nShare options reserve\n9,672\n119,640\nAccumulated deficit\n(12,562,517)\n(12,275,849)\nTotal equity\n(971,467)\n(574,831)\nTotal liabilities and equity\n1,823\n58,116\nThe above Company Statement of Financial Position should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.\nThe Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24th December 2025 and were signed on its behalf\nSiro Donato Cicconi,\nChief Executive Officer\nMalcolm Groat,\nChairman\nSTATEMENT OF\nCHANGES IN EQUITY\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\nShare capital\n\u00a3\nDeferred Share Capital\n\u00a3\nShare premium\n\u00a3\nAccumulated deficit\n\u00a3\nShare options reserve\n\u00a3\nTotalequity\n\u00a3\nBalance at 31 December 2022\n4,619,750\n-\n6,755,628\n(11,833,513)\n119,640\n(338,495)\nShare consolidation\n(4,157,775)\n4,157,775\n-\nShare issue\n51,500\n-\n154,500\n206,000\nComprehensive loss\nfor 2023\n-\n-\n-\n(442,336)\n-\n(442,336)\nBalance at 31 December 2023\n513,475\n4,157,775\n6,910,128\n(12,275,849)\n119,640\n(574,831)\nShare consolidation\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCancelation of options\n-\n-\n-\n109,968\n(109,968)\n-\nComprehensive loss\nfor 2024\n-\n-\n-\n(396,636)\n-\n(396,636)\nBalance at 31 December 2024\n513,475\n4,157,775\n6,910,128\n(12,562,517)\n9,672\n(971,467)\nSTATEMENT OF\nCASH FLOW\nTHE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\n2024\n20\n23\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash flows from operating activities\nLoss for the period\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nCorrection for non-cash transaction\n-\nCash flows from/(used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities\n(396,636)\n(442,336)\nAdjustments for\nIncrease in trade and other receivables\n, VAT\n-\n(Decrease)/Increase in trade and other payables\n226,407\n258,984\nCash generated from operations\n(170,229)\n(183,352)\nNet cash flows used in operating activities\n(170,229)\n(183,352)\nCash flows from investing activities\nInvestment in subsidiary\n-\n-\nNet cash flows from investing activities\n-\n-\nCash flows from financing activities\nIssue of ordinary shares (including share premium)\n-\n206,000\nAdvanced subscription of shares\n83,956\nAdvancement of loan\n29,980\n-\nNet cash flows from financing activities\n113,936\n206,000\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n(56,293)\n22,648\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year\n58,116\n35,468\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the year\n1,823\n58,116\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS\nFOR THE\nYEAR\nENDED 31 DECEMBER\n2024\n1.\nGeneral Information\nThe Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales as a public company limited by shares on 15 June 2018 under the Companies Act 2006, with the name Agana Holdings Plc, and registered number 11418575. On 22 July 2019, the Company changed its name to Zaim Credit Systems Plc. On 23 March 2023, the Company changed its name to Adalan Ventures Plc.\nThe Company's registered office is located at 10 Orange Street, London, United Kingdom, WC2H 7DQ.\n2.\nPrincipal activities\nAs at 31 December 2024, the principal activity of the Company was to seek acquisition opportunities. The Company expects that consideration for the Acquisition will primarily be satisfied by issue of new Shares to a vendor (or vendors), but that some cash may also be payable by the Company. Any funds not used in connection with the Acquisition will be used for future acquisitions, internal or external growth and expansion, and working capital in relation to the acquired company or business.\nFollowing completion of the Acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its Shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, the Company intends to seek re-admission of the enlarged group to listing on the Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange or admission to another stock exchange.\n3.\nAccounting policies\n3.1\nBasis of Preparation\nThe Company has not yet commenced business and no dividends have been declared or paid since the date of incorporation.\nThe historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom.\nThe historical financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling (\"\u00a3\"), which is the Company's functional and presentational currency and has been prepared under the historical cost convention.\n3.2\nGoing concern\nThe accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Company generated a loss for the year of \u00a3393,636 and as at 31 December 2024 had net liabilities of \u00a3971,467.\nAs a result of the above, the Directors have reviewed the Company's expected operational results and cash requirements for the year from the date of these accounts. The company is dependent on the success of future fundraising in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The company is also in the process of seeking additional funding in order to purse its strategy of making an acquisition to seek re-admission of the enlarged group to listing on the Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange or admission to another stock exchange.\nShould the raising of new capital be unsuccessful then the Company faces significant uncertainty over its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has reduced its cash expenditure to a minimum and obtained short-term finance during the period of delay in completing any such fundraising to allow the Company to work on the re-capitalisation of the business. The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nHowever, as at the date of approval of these financial statements, there are no legally binding agreements in place in relation to any fundraising or extension of terms with creditors and as the success of any finance raising is outside the control of the company there can be no certainty that additional funds will be forthcoming, which indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in\nthe normal course of business. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.\n.\n3.3\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are recognized in the company's statement of financial position when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nFinancial assets are classified into specified categories. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of recognition.\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, other than those classified\nas\nfair value through the income statement, which are measured at fair value.\nTrade and other\nreceivables\nTrade receivables are recognized and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is considered to be remote.\nImpairment of financial\nassets\nFinancial assets, other than those at fair value through the income statement, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date\n.\nFinancial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.\nDerecognition of financial\nassets\nFinancial assets are derecognized only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the\nasset\nexpire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially\nall the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n3.4\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement or other financial liabilities.\nFinancial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when, and only when, the company's obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.\nTaxation\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realized. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers any cash on short-term deposits and other short term investments to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of financial position.\nShare based payments\nThe Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Company. The fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of share options are recognised as an expense. The total expense to be apportioned over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:\n\u00b7\nincluding any market performance conditions;\n\u00b7\nexcluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and\n\u00b7\nincluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.\nNon-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest.\nIt recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\nWhen options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.\nThe fair value of goods or services received in exchange for shares is recognised as an expense.\nForeign currency\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where such items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.\nGains and losses on purchase and sale of foreign currency are determined as a difference between the selling price and the carrying amount at the date of the transaction.\nShare capital\nShare capital comprises the nominal value paid for each share. Any premium paid over and above the nominal value is allocated to share premium, which is recorded net of any transaction specific costs.\n4.\nStandards and interpretations issued but not yet applied\nThe Company has not yet commenced business and no dividends have been declared or paid since the date of incorporation.\nThe historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom.\nThe historical financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling (\"\u00a3\"), which is the Company's functional and presentational currency and has been prepared under the historical cost convention.\nStandards and interpretations issued but not yet applied\nAt the date of authorisation of this financial information, the Directors have reviewed the Standards in issue by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") and IFRIC, which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after the stated effective date. In their view, none of these standards would have a material impact on the financial reporting of the Company.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income, expenditure, assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated, including expectations of future events to ensure these estimates to be reasonable.The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that\nare believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The Company's nature of operations is to act as a special purpose acquisition Company. This significantly reduces the level of estimates and assumptions required.The going concern status of the Company is considered to be a key judgement. This has been considered further in note 2.1 to the financial statements\n5.\nShare\ncapital\nNumber\n\u00a3\nIssued and fully paid\n31 December 2023 and 2024\n51,347,500\n513,475\n6.\nEarnings per share\nBasic & diluted earnings per share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share information for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share are determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the year\nWeighted average shares in issue\n(396,636)\n51,347,500\n(442,336)\n46,734,082\nBasic and diluted Earnings/(loss) per share (Pence)\n(0.77)\n(0.95)\nAs the Company was loss making in both periods the basic and diluted earnings per share are derived from using only the undiluted shares in issue with no effect for potential dilution resulting in the figures presented as the same for both measures.\nThe number of shares used to denominate the weighted average shares in issue has been adjusted in the prior year to account for the share consolidation which happened during the current year.\n7.\nOperating Expenses\n2024\n\u00a3\n20\n23\n\u00a3\nConsulting services\n9,000\n10,800\nCommunication\n-\n1,518\nBanking services\n1,049\n474\nInvestor Relations\n132,764\n25,169\nOther expenses\n69,287\n178,916\nTotal operating expenses\n212,100\n216,877\nOperating expenses include the cost of audit for the company of \u00a321,000 (2023: \u00a320,000).

This involves the commencement of trading in the company shares and issuance of a prospectus and or authority to allot shares being granted by shareholders at a general meeting and the annual authority to allot shares as determined by the FCA (currently 19.99%, due to increase to 75% on 19th January 2025).

The Company's accounting policies and method adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial assets, financial liability and equity instrument are set out in Note 2. The Company do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe principal financial instruments used by the Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nFinancial Assets\nLoans and receivables\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,823\n58,116\nTotal Financial Assets\n1,823\n58,116\nFinancial Liabilities measured at amortised cost\nTrade Payables\n99,783\n47,647\nTotal financial liabilities\n99,783\n47,647\nThere are no financial assets that are either past due or impaired.\n13.\nShare Based Payments\nNumber of options and warrants outstanding\nWeighted Average exercise price\n(p)\nOutstanding as at 31 December 2022\n20,150,000\n2.50\nShare consolidation\n2,015,000\n25.0\nIssued\n-\n-\nForfeited & cancelled\n-\n-\nOutstanding as at 31 December 2023\n2,015,000\n25.0\nForfeited & cancelled\n1,815,000\n25.0\nOutstanding as at 31 December 2024\n200,000\n27.0\n14.\nCapital management policy\nThe Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The capital structure of the Company consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued share capital and reserves.\n15.\nFinancial risk management\nThe Company uses a limited number of financial instruments, comprising cash and other payables, which arise directly from operations. The Company does not trade in financial instruments.\nFinancial risk factors\nThe Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash \ufb02ow interest rate risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance.\nCurrency risk\nThe Company does not operate internationally and its exposure to foreign exchange risk is limited to the transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling.\nCredit risk\nThe Company does not have any major concentrations of credit risk related to any individual customer or counterparty. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group has taken necessary steps and precautions in minimising the credit risk by lodging cash and cash equivalents only with reputable licensed banks.\nLiquidity risk\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the Company ensures it has adequate resource to discharge all its liabilities. The directors have considered the liquidity risk as part of their going concern assessment. (See note 2). At the date of approval of the financial statements there was a material uncertainty in relation to liquidity risk.\nCash flow interest rate risk\nThe Company has no significant interest-bearing liabilities and assets. The Company monitors the interest rate on its interest bearing assets closely to ensure favourable rates are secured.\nFair values\nManagement assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n16.\nUltimate Controlling Party\nThe ultimate controlling party is Zaim Holding SA which holds 69.2% of the share capital. Siro Cicconi, the Director of the Company is the ultimate beneficial owner of Zaim Holding SA, which he wholly owns through his life interest in Excelsior Foundation which wholly owns Zaim Holding SA\n17.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company received further advanced subscriptions for shares following the period end totaling \u00a3200,000. The shares are expected to be issued following the lifting of suspension of the trading on the London Stock Exchange and publication of a prospectus.\n18.\nRelated Party Transactions\nAs at the 31 December 2024 the Company owed a certain director \u00a38,581 as a result of cash advanced to the Company. This loan is repayable on demand and carries no interest.\n19.\nNumber of employees\nThe average number of employees during the year was 3 (2023: 4) and comprised solely the Directors.\n20.\nReserves\nR\netained earnings represents accumulated profit and losses to date.\nShare based payment reserve holds the fair value of equity share based payment arrangements at the date of\nissue once these instruments have been vested.\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares issued.\nShare Premium represents the premium issued over and above the nominal value of shares that have been fully paid up.\nThe deferred share capital reserve represents the deferred share capital following the 10 for 1 share consolidation undertaken during the period. This share capital carries no voting or other rights what so ever.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements set out above do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023\nwere approved by the Board of Directors on 11 February 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified.\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's auditor, RPG Crouch Chapman LLP.\nGoing concern\nThe Financial Statements have been\nprepared on a going concern basis. T\nhe Directors consider that the Company requires additional funding in order to deliver on its plan to find and acquire an operating business and undertake a reverse take over. The Directors are of the view that its current cash reserves along with any funding that it will seek to raise would provide sufficient funds to undertake its operating activities for the foreseeable future. Should the company be unsuccessful in raising additional capital then there is a significant risk that it has the ability to continue as a going concern. The company has currently reduced its cash expenditure to a minimum.\nPlease refer to the going concern note in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2023 for further information.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2024, and of its loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs); and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to the going concern note in the accounting policies, concerning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe matters explained indicate that the base case forecast for the Company requires short term working capital funding from the principal stakeholder. It also indicates that the Company needs to raise further funds to enable the Company to invest in future ventures currently planned for early 2026.\nThese events or conditions along with the matters set forth in in the accounting policies indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nWe have highlighted going concern as a key audit matter. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included (but not limited to):\n\u00b7\nReview of managements cash flow projections for a period of 12 months following approval of the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nReview of management's assumptions based on historical expenditure and contractual commitments;\n\u00b7\nSensitivity analysis on cash flow forecast to consider the available headroom under different reasonably possible scenarios;\n\u00b7\nConsideration of certainty of receipt of additional funding from stakeholders including precedent on agreements; and\n\u00b7\nReview of adequacy and completeness of disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the going concern assumption.\nOur approach to the audit\nIn planning our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjecti",

WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n22 October 2025\nAdalan Ventures Plc\n(\"Adalan\" or the \"Company\")\nUpdate on Reverse Takeover\nAdalan Ventures plc (the \"Company\" or \"Adalan\") is pleased to provide an update to the proposed reverse takeover Adalan previously announced on 7 December 2023. Topos Network Pte (\"Topos\") and the Company have reached a further non-binding agreement for the acquisition by the Company of the entire issued share capital of Topos (\"Acquisition\"). In addition Topos has confirmed the completion of a financing round that provides it with funds to begin expanding into new territories and further developing its existing business. Since the original Term Sheet was signed, the business of Topos has continued to grow and it now services directly and indirectly over 720,000 clients. Significant progress has also been made regarding opening up new geographies, which will now be the focus of the business both before and after the proposed Acquisition.\nUpdate to Term Sheet\nThe Company has entered into a modified form of the Term Sheet signed with Topos in December 2023 to enable the continued work on a reverse takeover (\"RTO\"). Under this agreement Topos and the Company have granted mutual exclusivity subject to the provisions of the UK City Code on Takeovers & Mergers. Both parties are now working towards extending this exclusivity period to 31 March 2026 and targeting the execution of a reverse takeover of Topos during Q1 2026. The Company has agreed to appoint Strand Hanson Limited as its Sponsor and Financial Adviser for these purposes. Whilst the refinancing process has taken longer than originally anticipated, the Company is now collaborating with a stronger and more developed Topos business and the Board of the Company are optimistic about the growth opportunities for the combined businesses of Adalan and Topos going forward.\nAll terms and conditions previously announced in the Term Sheet, with the exception of the share price which will be determined at the completion of the RTO, remain the same save that Re-Lender S.P.A. are no longer a party to this agreement.\nCEO statement:\nSiro Cicconi commented:\n\"After a fairly significant delay, I am pleased to confirm that the refinancing of Topos has been successfully completed, clearing the path for the acquisition to proceed. Having spent a significant amount of time working with the Topos team I am deeply encouraged by the opportunity that lies in front of Adalan. We have a good team focussed on executing the RTO as promptly as possible and I look forward to updating shareholders in due course\"\nFurther announcements regarding the\nAcquisition and RTO will be made as and when appropriate.\nEnquiries:\nAdalan Ventures\nPlc\nSiro Cicconi\nTel: +44 (0) 73 9377 9849\nOptiva Securities Limited\nVishal Balasingham\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3137 1902\nStrand Hanson Limited\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nChristopher Raggett\nAbigail Wennington\nImogen Ellis\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2023, and of its loss for the year then ended;\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs); and\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to the going concern note in the accounting policies, concerning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe matters explained indicate that the base case forecast for the Company requires short term working capital funding from the principal stakeholder. It also indicates that the Company needs to raise further funds to enable the Company to invest in future ventures currently planned for March 2025.\nThese events or conditions along with the matters set forth in in the accounting policies indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nWe have highlighted going concern as a key audit matter. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included (but not limited to):\nReview of managements cash flow projections for a period of 12 months following approval of the financial statements;\nReview of management's assumptions based on historical expenditure and contractual commitments;\nSensitivity analysis on cash flow forecast to consider the available headroom under different reasonably possible scenarios;\nConsideration of certainty of receipt of additional funding from stakeholders including precedent on agreements; and\nReview of adequacy and completeness of disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the going concern assumption.\nOur approach to the audit\nIn planning our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performe",

The Board believe the proposed Acquisitions meet these goals. With the targets selected having complementarity technologies, which when combined have potential to create significant synergies.\nThe two target businesses are Topos Network Pte. Ltd ('Topos') and Re-Lender S.P.A ('Re-Lender'). The Board believes that combining with these two businesses will give the Company the\nopportunity to create one \"world unique end-to-end financial infrastructure\" that provides to \"now unbankable\" people, living both in developed countries and even in poor rural areas of developed world, access to proper bank accounts, to digital financial services and directly link them.\nBackground information on Topos\nSingapore based Topos develops and extends a financial technology suite that allows the creation and management of last mile banking networks in frontier markets. Topos licenses its technology to newly established equity joint ventures with local stakeholders and supervised financial institutions to operate in target markets retaining a minority stake in such joint ventures.\nTopos's proprietary technology allows for the creation and operation of digital last mile banking that is able to open and operate micro accounts by GSM and/or low-tech mobiles to now unbankable people living below the threshold of 5U$D per day. This technology is suited to unserved rural areas of developing countries where lack of data grids is a barrier to more traditional digital providers.\nTopos's platform in the last 2 years has managed to:\n\u00b7\nAttract 680,000 new clients accounts in 24 months;\n\u00b7\nPull more than 320,000 clients up to \"Credit grade\" level; and\n\u00b7\nForged relationships with 46,000 bank agents.\nTopos has to date principally focused on Sub-Saharan Africa but has recently begun forging relationships with local banks in a number of other countries and is the process of establishing joint ventures with local banks in Middle East and North Africa region and Latin America and Southeast Asia. These joint ventures will be locally licensed \"Last mile banks\".\nTopos's technology suite enables its users to connect with family members who are part of their diaspora in developed world to facilitate access to credit.\nHowever, Topos lacks the regulatory permissions to directly access clients in the \"Sending side\" of money transaction and this is an important benefit in the proposed combination of the Company with Re-Leder and Topos. This is through the relationship with Re-Lender which operates a fintech lending platform in Italy.\nBackground information on Re-Lender\nRe-Lender began operating in 2020 and achieved breakeven point after few months and has since then has been operating profitably. By integrating its own authorisations and the authorisations of third parties, Re-Lender has rapidly built a successful business ecosystem with 35,000 permanent investors, a track record of ? 40 million in transactions and has a significant pipeline of potential future opportunities.\nRE-Lender has been recognised by the Politecnico di Milano crowdfunding report as the lending crowdfunding platform - with a broader focus beyond real estate - in terms of fundraising, emphasising its impactful presence in the industry in Italy.\nFollowing completion of the Acquisitions, the Company plans to integrate the Re-Lender business with Topos's platform to allow Topos to directly access its clients.\nThe Company's aim is that the integration of Re-Lender and Topos as part of Adalan's business will help them realise their potential and create the \"end to end\" financial infrastructure that will allow direct connection between people and organizations in developed countries with people and organizations in developing countries.\nThe Company has signed a term sheet with Topos and Re-Lender and their significant shareholders regarding the Acquisitions ('Term Sheet') that was inter alia conditional on completing a fundraise which the issue of shares announced on 14 November 2023 and an unsecured loan of \u00a3163,580 from Re-Lender more details",

To avoid the share price being prohibitively high for smaller investors, the Board proposes to split the Company's share capital so that every 1 ordinary share of \u00a30.01 each shall be reclassified into 1 ordinary shares of \u00a30.001 each (\"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") and 9 deferred shares of \u00a30.001 each (\"\nDeferred Shares\n\") (\"\nShare Capital Reclassification\n\").

          "full_content": "18 Jan 2023 13:03\nRNS Number : 1447N\nZAIM Credit Systems PLC\n18 January 2023\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).\n18 January 2023\nZaim Credit Systems plc\n(\"Zaim\" or the \"Company\")\nUpdate on operations in Russia and\nNotice of General Meeting\nDuring the two years to June 2022, considerable progress has been made operationally by Zaim Express. A transition to online lending has made the business bigger and more profitable, new financial offerings have been developed, and plans underway to extend the model to jurisdictions beyond Russia. This meant that by the end of June 2022, Zaim Express was continuing to exihibit strong growth and had a positive cash position of about GBP 760k at the end of the period.\nHowever, it came to our attention during September 2022 that something was amiss when the Zaim Express team in Moscow stopped communicating with the directors of the Company in London. Initial enquiries led us to suspend trading in Zaim's shares on 28 September 2022 while we undertook an investigation, drawing upon the help of international advisers. This investigation, made difficult by the current dislocation of normal links between Russia and The West, has revealed the following:-\nIn the Russian State Register of Legal Entities, the ownership of Zaim Express has been changed from Zaim to a Russian gentleman called Mr Sidorov. This change was not authorised by the Board of Directors of Zaim nor was it advised to the directors based outside of Russia (the \"Continuing Directors\") . Indeed, the Continuing Directors had no knowledge whatsoever of any aspect of it until they conducted the investigation. The Continuing Directors believe that the change in ownership was, therefore, questionable from a Russian and English law standpoint.\nIt would appear that the bankers to Zaim Express, assigned to a new lender their loan to Zaim Express, and so far as the Continuing Directors are aware, without providing Zaim Credit Systems plc and/or the Continuing Directors, with notice of this. The Continuing Directors believe that the new lender then sought to call either all or some of the debt due to it from Zaim Express. The Continuing Directors were not made aware of this by the Russian management team or the decision not to use Zaim Express's available funds to repay the debt but instead to default. The Continuing Directors believe that the new lender then enforced their security over the shares in Zaim Express and organised the sale of these shares to Mr Sidorov. The Company has not, as far as the Continuing Directors are aware, received notice of this sale and neither have any of the proceeds of the sale been remitted to the Company.\nThroughout these past few months, we have not been able to obtain a response from any of the key employees of Zaim Express in Moscow including Vladmir Golovko who is Chief Operating Officer of the Company and a member of the Company board. From public searches we have been able to confirm that Mr Golovko remains a general director of Zaim Express following its sale to Mr Sidorov.\nThe Company is currently considering its legal options to obtain redress from those involved in the loss of Zaim Express. In the meantime, the Continuing Directors, plan to call a General Meeting of the Company shortly. At this general meeting the board will propose a resolution to remove Vladimir Golovko from his role as a director of Zaim Credit Systems plc. The meeting will take soundings from shareholders on the future direction of the Company.\nPlease note that the Company's website is under the control of the team in Moscow and therefore should no longer be relied upon, a new website is in the process of being established and will be communicated to shareholders in due course. All communications from the Company will be sent through the news wire system and be available on the website of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe Company is currently discussing the lifting of the suspension of the listing in the Company's ordinary shares on the Standard Segment of the Official List with the FCA. No certainty can be given over the timing of any lifting of the suspension and the Company will update the market in due course.\nMalcolm Groat, Non-Executive Chairman of Zaim Credit Systems PLC, commented;\n\"In view of the tremendous efforts made during Covid to grow the business in Russia and begin to take the model to new countries and in view of the success achieved operationally and commercially in the past two years, it is tragic that everything that has been built and the prospects that lay ahead of the Group has been taken from us. Zaim is left severely damaged and must now plot a new course to bring back value for our investors.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nZaim Credit Systems plc\nSiro Donato Cicconi Chief Executive Officer\nMalc",

Due to the very strong appreciation of our operating currency (RUB) relative to our reporting currency (GBP) we reported growth of the loans issued across all business lines.\nOne of the significant factors that influenced our business performance was the restrictions on collecting activities imposed by the government starting from 1 April 2022.\nIn Q2 2021 we launched our branded mobile application that became an important sales channel and significant growth driver of our business. In Q2 2022 the mobile application was responsible for over 13% of loans issued, which is almost twice as much as our physical store business.\nThe weighted average default rate increased from 21.9% in Q4 2021 to 26.5% in Q1 2022 due to the lower collection receivables as a result of the government moratorium on collection activities. Overall we are pleased with the performance under the circumstances and we don't see this as a long term worsening of collecting activity, it is expected that after moratorium will end, a large portion of loans under default will be recovered and repayment levels will return to the previous trend\".\nSecond quarter 2022 trading update3\nThe table below presents the two main KPI's (loans issued and default rate) for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nJune-21\nSept-21\nDec-21\nMarch-22\nJune-22\nLoans Issued (\u00a3'000)\n6,332\n6,830\n7,813\n8,225\n9,303\nLoans Issued Growth Rate QoQ\n24\u00a0%\n8\u00a0%\n14\u00a0%\n5\u00a0%\n13\u00a0%\nLoans Issued Online (\u00a3'000)\n5,405\n5,677\n6,501\n6,909\n7,463\nLoans Issued Online Growth Rate QoQ\n25\u00a0%\n5\u00a0%\n15\u00a0%\n6\u00a0%\n8\u00a0%\nLoans Issued via Mobile Application (\u00a3'000)\n158\n420\n671\n860\n1,185\nLoans Issued via Mobile Application Growth Rate QoQ\nn/a\n167\u00a0%\n60\u00a0%\n28\u00a0%\n38\u00a0%\nLoans\u00a0Issued Offline (\u00a3'000)\n768\n733\n641\n456\n655\nLoans Issued Offline Growth Rate QoQ\n(4\u00a0%)\n(5\u00a0%)\n(13\u00a0%)\n(29\u00a0%)\n44\u00a0%\nWeighted Average\u00a0Default Rate4\n24.5\u00a0%\n22.7\u00a0%\n21.9\u00a0%\n26.5\u00a0%\nSee note5\nNotes:\n1\nAll figures presented throughout this announcement represent unaudited management information taken from the internally generated management accounts of Zaim-Express LLC\n2\nWeighted average exchange rates of British Pound vs. Russian Rouble in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022 were 115.2839 and 84.1915 respectively\n3\nStarting from our Q1 2022 trading update we are introducing the new reporting segment - \"Loans issued via mobile application\".

On a constant currency basis, Loans issued increased by 24% quarter-on-quarter and 81% year-on-year\n\u00b7\nLoans issued online reached\n\u00a3\n6.9m growing by 6% quarter-on-quarter and 60% year-on-year, which corresponded with 25% and 80% growth on constant currency basis respectively\n\u00b7\nLoans issued via mobile application launched in Q2 2021 increased by 28% quarter-on-quarter to\n\u00a30.9m in Q1 2022 or by 49%\non constant currency basis\n(no year-on-year comparison)\n\u00b7\nSignificant foreign exchange fluctuations between the functional currency and the reporting currency were observed during Q1, these moves reversed during Q2. Constant currency comparisons are presented to assist the presentation\n\u00b7\nOnline and mobile segments continuing to be the key engines for growth representing 84% and 10% of loans issued respectively\nSiro Cicconi, Zaim's CEO commented:\n\"Despite the economic volatility the business performance of the Group remained strong, demonstrating the seventh consecutive quarter of growth.\nAs our operating currency is the Russian rouble and reporting currency is the British pound, the fluctuation of exchange rate of these currencies affects our reported performance.\nEven with this negative influence of the forex rates our business continued to grow both on quarter-on-quarter (5% in GBP terms and 24%\non constant currency basis\n) and year-on-year (61% in GBP terms and 81%\non constant currency basis\n). We are significantly overperforming a very fast-growing market: the Russian microfinance market grew by 37% year-on-year\n[2]\non constant currency basis\n(22% in GBP terms). In Q2 2022 we saw the reversal of the forex trend with Russian rouble significantly strengthening vs. British pound, which will positively influence our reported numbers in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn Q2 2021 we launched our branded mobile application that became an important sales channel and significant growth driver of our business. In Q1 2022 the mobile application was responsible for over 10% of loans issued, which now represents a significantly larger proportion than our physical store business\n\"\nFirst quarter 2022 trading update 5\nThe table below presents the two main KPI's (loans issued and default rate) for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nMarch-21\nJune-21\nSept-21\nDec-21\nMarch-22\nLoans Issued (\u00a3'000)\n5,109\n6,332\n6,830\n7,813\n8,225\nLoans Issued Growth Rate QoQ\n34%\n24%\n8%\n14%\n5%\nLoans Issued Online (\u00a3'000)\n4,308\n5,405\n5,677\n6,501\n6,909\nLoans Issued Online Growth Rate QoQ\n49%\n25%\n5%\n15%\n6%\nLoans Issued via Mobile Application (\u00a3'000)\n-\n158\n420\n671\n860\nLoans Issued via Mobile Application Growth Rate QoQ\n-\nn/a\n167%\n60%\n28%\nLoans\u00a0Issued Offline (\u00a3'000)\n801\n768\n733\n641\n456\nLoans Issued Offline Growth Rate QoQ\n(13%)\n(4%)\n(5%)\n(13%)\n(29%)\nWeighted Average\u00a0Default Rate[3]\n20,8%\n24.5%\n22.7%\n21.9%\nSee note[4]\nIn order to eliminate the effect of GBP/RUB fluctuations on the financial results of Zaim Express, below is the table of loans issued\non\nconstant currency basis\n.

The Group proceeded to optimise the physical store business, including the closure of loss-making outlets and moved forward focusing the majority of the Group's resource towards the online business.\nIn Q2 2021, the Group launched the new sales channel - its own branded mobile application. This development not only allowed us to better understand our customers, but became an important source of the new business: in December 2021, the share of loans issued via the mobile app reached 9.2%, exceeding the share of loans issued via offline retail stores (6.7%). Total share of loans issued online and via the mobile platform reached 93.3%, which signifies completion of the transition towards online-centered business model.\nThis transition was executed well and I am pleased with the results, demonstrated by the strong growth combined with a high profitability during 2021. We have significantly outgrown the market by increasing the value of the loans issued by 153% in 2021 compared to 2020, while the local microloans market increased only 32% year-on-year. What is more impressive that the amount of loans issued online (both desktop and mobile platform grew by 4.9 times to o \u00a323.1m (2020: \u00a34.8m), while the online microloans portfolio in the local microfinance market only doubled.\nWhile it is impossible to predict the full consequences of the \"special military operation\" of Russia in Ukraine, it is worth mentioning that the Directors and the management of Zaim have a successful track record of managing challenging situations by reacting swiftly and decisively. As an example, developing and implementing the new strategy during COVID-19 restriction, our team had evolved Zaim from a traditional microfinance organisation into a rapidly developing, and profitable fintech company.\nI would like to cordially thank the management, employees, consultants and my fellow board members for their hard work and dedication in delivering these tremendous results and turning the company into a rapidly growing and profitable business. I believe that the vast experience and dedication of the Board and management team coupled with our low fixed cost highly scalable business model will help us to run the business in a challenging economic environment in the interests of all our stakeholders providing best in class fast and flawless digital services.\"\nA copy of the Report and Accounts will be available on the Company's website,\nwww.\nzaimcreditsystemsplc\n.com/english\nand also from the National Storage Mechanism.\nFollow us on Twitter - @ZaimcreditSyst\nSign up for our Newsletter -\nhttps://tinyurl.com/4jjuuwve\nEnquiries:\nZaim Credit Systems Plc\nSimon Retter\nSiro Cicconi\nTel: +44 (0) 73 9377 9849\nA",

Despite this we are firmly committed to adhering to all our duties to our stakeholders and our customers. These results show that the fourth quarter of 2021 became the sixth consecutive quarter of profitable growth. Our operational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the online-focused strategy that we employed in the middle of 2020.\nWe are significantly overperforming a very fast-growing market: the Russian microfinance market grew by 35% year-on-year\n[2]\n, whilst the amount of loans issued by Zaim Express more than doubled\n[3]\n. We are investing in growth, being careful to maintain cash generation and profitability.\nQuarter-on-quarter growth remains strong at 14%, showing acceleration vs. the previous quarter.\nThe business continues to be cash-generative, which we are carefully reinvesting in order to serve a wider base of clients with our online business. Our online-focused strategy allows for lower fixed costs and faster growth that makes us confident in the long-term development of our business. Our investment in our proprietary platform and process delivered impressive results and I\nwould like to thank the whole team for their dedication in these uncertain times.\"\nFourth quarter 2021 trading update\nThe table below presents the two main KPI's (loans issued and default rate) for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nDec-20\nMarch-21\nJune-21\nSept-21\nDec-21\nLoans Issued (\u00a3'000)\n3,812\n5,109\n6,332\n6,830\n7,813\nLoans Issued Growth Rate QoQ\n65%\n34%\n24%\n8%\n14%\nLoans Issued Online (\u00a3'000)\n2,889\n4,308\n5,564\n6,097\n7,173\nLoans Issued Online Growth Rate QoQ\n151%\n49%\n29%\n10%\n18%\nLoans\u00a0Issued Offline (\u00a3'000)\n923\n801\n768\n733\n641\nLoans Issued Offline Growth Rate QoQ\n(20%)\n(13%)\n(4%)\n(5%)\n(13%)\nWeighted Average\u00a0Default Rate\n[4]\n17.7%\n20,8%\n24.5%\n22.7%\nSee note\n[5]\nZaim Express continued to see\nstrong growth in loans issued by 14% QoQ,\ndriven by expansion of the online platform.\nThe weighted average default rate decreased slightly to 22.7% in Q3 as a result of more conservative approach to the credit scoring in line with the management expectations.\nLoans issued for the financial year:\nFull Year Ended\nDec 20\nDec 21\nChange\nLoans Issued\u00a0Online\n\u00a34.8m\n\u00a323.1m\n386.4%\nLoans Issued\u00a0Offline\n\u00a35.5m\n\u00a3 2.9m\n(46.5%)\nTotal\u00a0Loans Issued\n\u00a310.3m\n\u00a326.0m\n154.2%\nThe Company looks forward to releasing its audited results for the year-ended 31 December 2021 in due course.\nNotes:\n1\nAll figures presented throughout this announcement represent unaudited management information taken from the internally generated management accounts of Zaim-Express LLC\n2\nAccording to the Central Bank of Russia's latest available data, growth of the portfolio of microloans in Q3 2021 was 35% compared to Q3 2020\n3\nLoans issued by Zaim Express in Q4 2021 increased by 105% vs. Q4 2020\n4\nDefault rate is defined as no payment received after 120 days of the origination of the loan\n5\nData is not yet available for the quarter ended 30 September 2021\u00a0as the earliest time to determine default rates is 120 days after the end of the period\n*Ends*\nFollow us on Twitter - @ZaimcreditSyst\nSign up for our Newsletter -\nhttps://tinyurl.com/4jjuuwve\nEnquiries:\nZaim Credit Systems Plc\nSimon Retter\nSiro Cicconi\nTel: +44 (0) 73 9377 9849\nAlex Boreyko\nTel: +7\u00a092",

Our operational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the online-focused strategy that we employed in the middle of 2020.\nWe are significantly overperforming a very fast-growing market: the Russian microfinance market grew by 35% year-on-year [2], whilst the amount of loans issued by Zaim almost tripled [3]. We are investing in growth, being careful to maintain cash generation and profitability.\nQuarter-on-quarter growth remains strong at 8%, lower than in previous quarters due to a combination of a higher base effect and a deliberate business decision to temporarily restrain growth and offerings to new clients to improve profitability whilst technical improvements were made to Zaim's loans platform in September.\nOur branded mobile application, that we have launched in the previous quarter, has become an important sales channel: since its launch we have issued over \u00a3737k via the mobile application and over 44 000 people downloaded the app. In September 2021, the amount of loans issued via Zaim's mobile application reached 73% of the amount of loans issued via offline shops.\nManagement is also working on evolving the \"Stores Network\" into a Strategic Business unit. Despite the decrease of loans issued, our stores are still profitable and are strategically located in densely populated areas. We are launching in the coming months a set of fee based financial services that will leverage the physical accessibility of our flagship stores and will improve their profitability.\nI am proud of the way our team has managed and addressed all the challenges associated with the Group's strong growth while we were beginning to operate in the online marketplace.\nOur focus now is to seize the opportunity, as we are operating in a healthy, transparent and rapidly growing market and to continue to outperform this market. We see a significant opportunity in terms of value generation and introduction of new services and products.\nOur plans are now to accelerate the digitalization of the company in order to target a broader market segment and much larger business volumes whilst keeping operational costs low.\"\nThird quarter 2021 trading update\nThe table below presents the two main KPI's (loans issued and default rate) for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nSept-20\nDec-20\nMarch-21\nJune-21\nSept-21\nLoans Issued (\u00a3'000)\n2,307\n3,812\n5,109\n6,332\n6,830\nLoans Issued Growth Rate QoQ\n42%\n65%\n34%\n24%\n8%\nLoans Issued Online (\u00a3'000)\n1,153\n2,889\n4,308\n5,564\n6,097\nLoans Issued Online Growth Rate QoQ\n205%\n151%\n49%\n29%\n10%\nLoans\u00a0Issued Offline (\u00a3'000)\n1,154\n923\n801\n768\n733\nLoans Issued Offline Growth Rate QoQ\n(7%)\n(20%)\n(13%)\n(4%)\n(5%)\nWeighted Average\u00a0Default Rate[4]\n15.8%\n17.7%\n20,8%\n24.5%\nSee note[5]\nThe Group continued to see growth in loans issued during the quarter with an increase of 196% YoY and 8% QoQ,\u00a0driven by growth in the online business.\nThe weighted average default rate increased to 24.5% in Q2 as a result of the increase in the number of first-time customers which inherently have statistically higher probabilit",

A copy of the full interim results are available on the Company's website, www.\nzaimcreditsystemsplc.com.\nKey H1 2021 Highlights\nGrowth and Profit Simultaneously Delivered\nSuccessful implementation of highly scalable, low-fixed-cost online-focused strategy, has resulted in:\n\u2022\nA dramatic increase in the amount of overall loans issued for the H1 2021 period by 2.78 times to \u00a311.45m (total for both on-line and off-line) (H1 2020: \u00a34.12m);\n\u2022\nOutstanding growth of amount of loans issued online by 13.6 times to \u00a39.88m with o\nnline business now comprising 86% of overall loans issued;\n\u2022 Net H1 profit of \u00a3229,000 vs. net loss of \u00a31,335,000 in H1 2020 (profit recovery of c.\u00a31,564m);\n\u2022\nGrowing Cash Balance of \u00a31,167,000 as at 30 June 2021 (an increase of \u00a3526,000 vs. 31 December 2020)\n\u2022\nStaff costs decreased significantly by 25% to \u00a3724,000 vs. 1H 2020\n\u2022\nOperating expenses reduced by 10% to \u00a3948,000 vs. 1H 2020\nZaim's transition to a digital business has delivered a growth in H1 2021 amounts lent equal to a multiple of 2.78 times volume seen in the same period of the previous year. At the same time the overall operational costs have been significantly reduced. This has led to an improvement in profit in excess of \u00a31.5 million compared to the prior period and management expects further improvements in cash flow from operating activities in H2 2021.\nZaim CEO, Siro Cicconi commented:\n\"I am very pleased to report another period of strong and profitable growth. In the first half of 2021 Zaim continued to execute its strategy to transition to an online lending model. This strategy\nresulted in a significant increase in access to our products without the need to visit our stores and at the same time decreasing our fixed costs base. Following one year of the launch of the new business model, we have proved that the path to digitalisation was the correct one and through further plans to increase our digital service and new business offerings we are now poised to generate substantial value for our shareholders.\nIn the first half of 2021 our team continued to develop our services by introducing new payment methods (Apple Pay/Google Pay), launching a campaign manager to manage advertising communications, further improving user interface. At the same time, our initiatives, launched in the second half of 2020 such as target advertisement, search engine optimization, launch of online business on a 24/7 schedule, continued to bear fruits.\nAs a result, the amount of loans issued in the first half of 2021 grew by 2.78 times vs. the first half of 2020 on the back of an impressive growth of loans issued online by 13.6 times. In the first half of 2021 86% of loans were issued online vs. only 17% in the first half of 2020.\nAn increase in the amount of loans issued was partially offset by a decrease in the average duration of the loan by 42% as online loans have fewer duration than offline loans, however, interest income in the first half of 2021 grew by a healthy 55% vs. the first half of 2020.\nAt the same time, staff costs have decreased by 25% and operating expenses have decreased by 10% due to the online expansion all resulting in a Net profit for H1 2021 of\n\u00a3229k a c\u00a31.5million improvement on the losses declared in the same period of 2020. Zaim's\nfour consecutive quarters of rapid year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth demonstrate the strength of our business model. Our management is focused on maximising the growth and gaining as much market share as possible.\nWe have recently launched our branded mobile application (Zaim Mobile App) that became a new sales channel for our company along with online and offline sales channels. The App allows existing customers to get loans faster and easier, increasing loyalty of the clients by improving their customer experience. We expect it to become a significant growth driver for our business given the rapid growth of the online customer base.\nThe successful launch of the Zaim Mobile App is an important milestone in the path of increasing the Fintech content in our business model. It creates the opportunity to widen the knowledge we have of our clients, understand their needs, attitudes and source information and data that",

In the second quarter of 2021 we have continued to perform well and the growth in the business remains strong with a 24% Quarter on Quarter increase in loans issued.\nCrucially important is that fact that nearly all of Zaim's business with the exception of some flagship and legacy stores is now generated through our online channel.\nThis is important as our online strategy makes our business sustainably profitable due to a significantly lower fixed cost base and greater scalability. Our continued investment in our proprietary platform and process, including the launch of mobile application, which represents an additional sales channel and a significant growth driver of the business, makes us confident that the online part of the business is now very well positioned to capture further market share thus satisfying our growth objectives and positioning the company to significantly drive shareholder value going forward.\nWe look forward to updating upon our H1 2021 financial results at the end of September followed shortly afterwards by our Q3 2021 trading update.\"\nSecond quarter 2021 trading update\nThe table below presents the two main KPI's (loans issued and default rate) for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nJune-20\nSept-20\nDec-21\nMarch-21\nJune-21\nLoans Issued (\u00a3'000)\n1,622\n2,307\n3,812\n5,109\n6,332\nLoans Issued Growth Rate QoQ\n(36%)\n42%\n65%\n34%\n24%\nLoans Issued Online (\u00a3'000)\n378\n1,153\n2,889\n4,308\n5,564\nLoans Issued Online Growth Rate QoQ\n9%\n205%\n151%\n49%\n29%\nLoans\nIssued Offline (\u00a3'000)\n1,244\n1,154\n923\n801\n768\nLoans Issued Offline Growth Rate QoQ\n(44%)\n(7%)\n(20%)\n(13%)\n(4%)\nWeighted Average\u00a0Default Rate[2]\n12.1%\n15.8%\n17.7%\n20,8%\nSee note[3]\nNotes:\n1 All figures presented throughout this announcement represent unaudited management information taken from the internally generated management accounts of Zaim-Express LLC\n2 Default rate is defined as no payment received after 120 days of the origination of the loan\n3 Data is not yet available for the quarter ended 30 June 2021\u00a0as the earliest time to determine default rates is 120 days after the end of the period\nThe Group continued to see\u00a0strong growth in loans issued during the quarter with an increase of 24% QoQ,\u00a0driven by growth in the online business\nThe weighted average default rate increased to 20.8% in Q1 as a result of the increase in the number of first-time customers which inherently have statistically higher probability of defaults.\nThis increase in default levels is in line with the management expectations and is a result of the strategy to maximise growth and gain as much market share as possible.

Customers can calculate the loan amount, apply for a loan online, receive a loan and obtain information on the status of the existing loan seamlessly. It also maintains loan and payment history, customer data, allows adding a credit or debit card, linking and unlinking it with the customer's account and supports full or partial repayment of the loan.\nIn addition to the customer experience noted above, the Mobile App also acts as a promotional tool facilitating the sending of push notifications, including information about promotions and discounts and other communications to the customers.\nThe Mobile App is available for both iOS and Android platforms with the majority of the Group's users expected to utilise the Android version due to prevalence of this system throughout the client base.\nZaim's CEO, Siro Cicconi commented:\n\"The successful launch of the Zaim Mobile App is an important milestone in the path of increasing the Fintech content in our business model. It creates the opportunity to widen the knowledge we have of our clients, understand their needs, attitudes and source information and data that will drive Zaim in the creation of next generation services.\nThe App creates new revenue streams including the possibility of cross-selling activity with the products of potential partners as well as allowing existing customers to get access to our products faster and with greater ease. In an ever increasingly digital world this expansion of our online offering will bring more people access to the financial products that many of us take for granted.\nGiven the rapid growth of the online customer base we expect the App to become a significant growth driver for our business. The Mobile app establishes direct contact with all users who have installed it and with the help of notifications about promotions, discounts and bonuses, it is expected to increase the number of repeat customers and also market any future products that the Group launches. We remain excited about the future prospects of the business and look forward to updating the market further with our regular quarterly updates on business volumes in due course\".\nStrategic Rationale for the Zaim App\nBuilding Customer Loyalty\nBy providing customers with the opportunity to instantly apply for a new loan, view current debt levels, and make payments in two clicks on their smartphone, Zaim has built a powerful tool to increase loyalty. Loyalty programmes are integrated into the Mobile App and functionality to allow the customer to instantly share useful promotions, discounts or bonuses with other customers, facilitates greater direct marketing opportunities and customer retention for Zaim.\nNew Marketing Tool\nThe Mobile App will also allow Zaim to take full advantage of personalisation tools by sending push notifications relating to new promotions and discounts. Zaim will be able to offer users who have installed the app access to exclusive offers and special bonuses; these will also be used to draw attention to the Zaim brand through various marketing campaigns.\nCustomer Analytics\nUnderstanding Customer behaviour is a key element to success in any business area and with the help of the App we can obtain useful Big Data, which helps us to build customer loyalty. An example of this would be tracking how much time customers spend in the App or which features are used most often and which are the less popular. By tracking how people interact with our app, we can understand how we can improve it to make it more convenient for the users and tailor the product offering accordingly.\nTechnological Superiority\nThe launch of the App is part of the Group strategy to continue its technological advantage with the ultimate aim of obtaining te",

Our continued investment in our proprietary platform and process, including the development of a soon to be launched mobile application through which we hope to be a significant additional driver of growth in the business, makes us confident that the online part of the business is now very well positioned to capture further market share.\nQ1 is traditionally the weakest and worst performing quarter of the year due to seasonal, holidays and traditional factors, so I am delighted the business continued its strong growth which is underpinned by strong cash generation from the existing portfolio. This sets the scene for a positive rest of the year to come and I look forward to updating the market further in due course\"\nFirst quarter 2021 trading update\nThe table below presents the two main KPI's (loans issued and default rate) for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nMarch-20\nJune-20\nSept-20\nDec-21\nMarch-21\nLoans Issued (\u00a3'000)\n2,549\n1,622\n2,307\n3,812\n5,109\nLoans Issued Growth Rate QoQ\n(36%)\n42%\n65%\n34%\nLoans Issued Online (\u00a3'000)\n346\n378\n1,153\n2,889\n4,308\nLoans Issued Online Growth Rate QoQ\n9%\n205%\n151%\n49%\nGrowth Issued Offline (\u00a3'000)\n2,203\n1,244\n1,154\n923\n801\nLoans Issued Offline Growth Rate QoQ\n(44%)\n(7%)\n(20%)\n(13%)\nWeighted Average\u00a0Default Rate\n[2]\n13.6%\n12.1%\n15.8%\n17.7%\nSee note\n[3]\nNotes:\n1 All figures presented throughout this announcement represent unaudited management information taken from the internally generated management accounts of Zaim-Express LLC\n2 Default rate is defined as no payment received after 120 days of the origination of the loan\n3 Data is not yet available for the quarter ended 31 March 2021\u00a0as the earliest time to determine default rates is 120 days after the end of the period\nThe Group continued to see\u00a0strong growth in loans issued during the quarter with an increase of 34% QoQ,\u00a0driven by growth in the online business\nThe weighted average default rate increased slightly to 17.7% in Q4 as a result of the increase in the number of first-time customers which inherently have statistically higher probability of defaults.\nThis increase in default levels is in line with the management expectations and is a result of the strategy to maximise growth and gain as much market share as possible. This is being diligently managed and is caused by the rapid growth of online business and is not due to any deterioration of business performance.\nRecent trading & Outlook\nWith Q1 now behind us the business continues to grow strongly and with the availability of further funding the Group is well placed to gain further market share. We continue to implement improvements to the user experience and technology and explore new product offerings to further grow the business.\nEnquiries:\nZaim Credit Systems Plc\nSimon Retter\nSiro Cicconi\nTel: +44 (0) 73 9377 9849\nAlex Boreyko\nTel: +7\u00a0925\u00a0708 9\n8 16\ninvestors@zaimcreditsystemsplc.com\nInvestor Relations: Flowcomms Ltd\nSasha Sethi\nTel: +44 (0)7891 677441\nsasha@flowcomms.com\nAdviser:\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nRoland Cornish / Jame",

This was unfortunately impacted quite severely during March - June 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and still to a slightly lesser extent for the remainder of 2020. This posed a serious challenge for our management team and the whole business at every level and I would like to thank all of our employees, customers, consultants and the management team for their hard work and dedication through the difficult time.\nDuring the quarantine period\nin the Q2 2020\n, the Group rapidly accelerated the shift in its business model to remote lending via the Internet, which resulted in a significant increase in access to our products without the need to visit our stores and at the same time decreasing the fixed costs base. The Group proceeded to optimise the physical store business, including the closure of loss-making outlets and moved forward focussing the majority of the Group's resource towards the online business. This was executed well and I am pleased with the results demonstrated by the profitability in the second half of 2020.\nThe Group experienced exceptional growth in lending volumes over the second half of 2020 and continues to see a large opportunity for our business to continue its current trajectory. I am both excited and optimistic about what the future holds for our Company and look forward to updating the market in the future.\"\nA copy of the",

The equivalent monthly rate of approximately 1.2% for this additional loan compares favorably to the current returns generated from the lending activities of the Group and is expected to have a meaningful impact on the financial performance of the business at what is a critical time for the rapid growth of the Group.\nThe Group ended 2020 with a strong performance and is pleased to report this has continued into 2021, a further update on the performance will be included in the financial results for the year to be released before the end of April.\nSiro Cicconi: CEO of Zaim Credit Systems commented:\n\"We are pleased to note that our business, especially its online segment is growing beyond our expectations. As such we have found that we have had to restrict supply of loans to new customers - this additional facility will help us finance some of this additional demand and therefore enable us to enhance shareholder returns.

This is a direct result of the rapid growth of the online business.\nSiro Cicconi, Zaim's CEO commented:\n\"Last year posed a serious challenge for all of us and I am pleased to report that it became a turning point in Zaim's transition towards a predominantly online business model. The lockdown measures taken by governments and the world-wide migration to online services accelerated this change. The board and management acted swiftly and decisively by putting the majority of the resources of the group into development of online business which is now beginning to bear fruit.\nAs a result of these efforts, loans issued online grew at an impressive rate during the year, from a near standing start to \u00a32.9m in Q4 and now accounting for 76% of the Group's business. This part of the business is now very well positioned for future growth.\nI am also pleased to note that the business continues to be cash-generative, which we are reinvesting in order to accelerate further growth of our online business. Our online-focused strategy allows for lower fixed costs and faster growth that makes us confident in the long-term development of our business. Our investment in our proprietary platform and process is delivering impressive results and we will be very focused on continuing to drive growth during 2021.\nI would like to thank the whole team for their dedication and look forward to this positive trend continuing over the coming months.\"\nFourth quarter 2020 trading update\nThe table below presents the two main KPI's (loans issued and default rate) for the last five quarters:\nQuarter Ended\nDec-19\nMarch-20\nJune-20\nSept-20\nDec-20\nLoans Issued\n(\u00a3'000)\n\u00a32,284\n\u00a32,549\n\u00a31,622\n\u00a32,307\n\u00a3\n3\n,\n812\nWeighted Average\u00a0Default Rate2\n8.1%\n13.6%\n12.1%\n15.8%\nSee note3\nThe Group continued to see\nstrong growth in loans issued during the quarter up 65% QoQ,\ndriven by expansion of the online platform.\nThe weighted average default rate increased slightly to 15.8% in Q3 as a result of the increase in the share of first-time customers that have higher levels of default. This is in line with the management expectations, is being diligently managed and is caused by the rapid growth of online business and is not due to any deterioration of business performance.\nComposition of the loan book\nLoans issued in each of the months of the fourth quarter of 2020 are set out in the following table:\nPeriod\nLoans\nIssued Online\n\u00a3'000\nMonthly\nGrowth rate\n%\nLoans\nIssued\nOffline\n\u00a3'000\nLoans\nIssued\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\nMonthly\nGrowth rate\n%\nOctober\n694\n32\n.\n1%\n324\n1\n,\n019\n14\n.\n1%\nNovember\n860\n23\n.\n9%\n306\n1\n,\n166\n14\n.\n5%\nDecember\n1\n,\n334\n55\n.\n1%\n293\n1\n,\n628\n39\n.\n5%\nTotal\u00a0Third\u00a0Quarter\n2\n,\n889\n923\n3\n,\n812\nLoans issued for the financial year:\nFull Year Ended\nDec 20\nDec 19\nChange\nLoans Issued\nOnline\n\u00a3\n4\n.8m\n\u00a30.3m\n1\n,\n435\n.\n8%\nLoans Issued\nOffline\n\u00a3\n5\n.5m\n\u00a3\n9.0\nm\n(\n38\n.\n7%\n)\nTotal\nLoans Issued\n\u00a3\n10.3\nm\n\u00a3\n9.3\nm\n10\n.\n5%\nThe Company looks forward to releasing its audit annual accounts for the year-ended 31 December 2020 in due course.\n*Ends*\nFollow us on Twitter - @ZaimcreditSyst\nEnquiries:\nZaim Credit Systems Plc\nSimon Retter\nSiro Cic",

These are listed as being under the control of the CEO Siro Ciccone.

I find it a very interesting offering considering the low default rate, the aim to service Russian nationals located outside the country at any given time, and also possible expansion into other areas of Europe with the app being the catalyst. It\u2019s odd to me that I rarely see any chatter on them though other than here (I have been a long time lurker between here and advfn but only recently created account here). Their social media updates seem to recycle the same quotes too which is a bit ... boring. I think their branding style etc. is great though, just not much for them to report at the minute it seems!",

          "content": "That default rate is not high. Also read the below from recent broker note, lots of the defaulted loans are actually paid back. Aside from the Algorithm, Zaim also screen against several databases, including CBR blacklists, criminal databases (both national and international), and sanctions lists. An important consideration to make is that due to Zaim\u2019s CBR regulated status, any borrower who defaults on a Zaim loan is put on the aforementioned CBR blacklist. Not only are individuals on this list unable to access financial services from any regulated entity, but also forbidden from leaving the country or working in the public sector. Since the defaulting loan needs repaid in order for an individual to be removed from the blacklist, Zaim consistently see customers repaying debts which had been written off, and can therefore count these repayments as extraordinary revenue items for accounting purposes. In 2018, Zaim reported an 8% default rate for existing customers, and a 38% default rate for new customers. Given that the company has stated a 50:50 split between these two groups, an average total default rate of 23% can be inferred. Whilst this might seem high, the company also reported that 89% of loans issued in 2018 were repaid. Note that this implies 11% outstanding loans in default, and therefore that over half of loans written off as bad debt were in fact repaid within the calendar year. This incentive to repay bad debts, combined with the risk mitigation provided by the Credit Scoring Algorithm, allow Zaim to operate without any use of repossession services or repeat calling to debtors, either of which might be considered uncompliant or a punishable abuse of power upon examination by the CBR.",

The 'free float' of the remainder may actually be relatively small. I think Zaim SA is the counterparty for the bond but my knowledge of the structure is very limited. These are listed as being under the control of the CEO Siro Ciccone. I would like to invest more (currently in for 1m shares) but do see it as a long term investment and need other things to platy out shorter term to make a further purchase.

          "content": "That default rate is not high. Also read the below from recent broker note, lots of the defaulted loans are actually paid back. Aside from the Algorithm, Zaim also screen against several databases, including CBR blacklists, criminal databases (both national and international), and sanctions lists. An important consideration to make is that due to Zaim\u2019s CBR regulated status, any borrower who defaults on a Zaim loan is put on the aforementioned CBR blacklist. Not only are individuals on this list unable to access financial services from any regulated entity, but also forbidden from leaving the country or working in the public sector. Since the defaulting loan needs repaid in order for an individual to be removed from the blacklist, Zaim consistently see customers repaying debts which had been written off, and can therefore count these repayments as extraordinary revenue items for accounting purposes. In 2018, Zaim reported an 8% default rate for existing customers, and a 38% default rate for new customers. Given that the company has stated a 50:50 split between these two groups, an average total default rate of 23% can be inferred. Whilst this might seem high, the company also reported that 89% of loans issued in 2018 were repaid. Note that this implies 11% outstanding loans in default, and therefore that over half of loans written off as bad debt were in fact repaid within the calendar year. This incentive to repay bad debts, combined with the risk mitigation provided by the Credit Scoring Algorithm, allow Zaim to operate without any use of repossession services or repeat calling to debtors, either of which might be considered uncompliant or a punishable abuse of power upon examination by the CBR.",

The 'free float' of the remainder may actually be relatively small. I think Zaim SA is the counterparty for the bond but my knowledge of the structure is very limited. These are listed as being under the control of the CEO Siro Ciccone. I would like to invest more (currently in for 1m shares) but do see it as a long term investment and need other things to platy out shorter term to make a further purchase.

          "content": "That default rate is not high. Also read the below from recent broker note, lots of the defaulted loans are actually paid back. Aside from the Algorithm, Zaim also screen against several databases, including CBR blacklists, criminal databases (both national and international), and sanctions lists. An important consideration to make is that due to Zaim\u2019s CBR regulated status, any borrower who defaults on a Zaim loan is put on the aforementioned CBR blacklist. Not only are individuals on this list unable to access financial services from any regulated entity, but also forbidden from leaving the country or working in the public sector. Since the defaulting loan needs repaid in order for an individual to be removed from the blacklist, Zaim consistently see customers repaying debts which had been written off, and can therefore count these repayments as extraordinary revenue items for accounting purposes. In 2018, Zaim reported an 8% default rate for existing customers, and a 38% default rate for new customers. Given that the company has stated a 50:50 split between these two groups, an average total default rate of 23% can be inferred. Whilst this might seem high, the company also reported that 89% of loans issued in 2018 were repaid. Note that this implies 11% outstanding loans in default, and therefore that over half of loans written off as bad debt were in fact repaid within the calendar year. This incentive to repay bad debts, combined with the risk mitigation provided by the Credit Scoring Algorithm, allow Zaim to operate without any use of repossession services or repeat calling to debtors, either of which might be considered uncompliant or a punishable abuse of power upon examination by the CBR.",

I texted Mr Cicconi on 13 November with a request for clarification as to which ones are the property of the A.I.M. listed Zaim; as of 22 November I have not received a reply. Does anyone know the answer? I like the look of the company but strange things happen in Russia. Also, any views on post-Covid-19 prospects of this company?",

The 'free float' of the remainder may actually be relatively small. I think Zaim SA is the counterparty for the bond but my knowledge of the structure is very limited. These are listed as being under the control of the CEO Siro Ciccone. I would like to invest more (currently in for 1m shares) but do see it as a long term investment and need other things to platy out shorter term to make a further purchase.

I find it a very interesting offering considering the low default rate, the aim to service Russian nationals located outside the country at any given time, and also possible expansion into other areas of Europe with the app being the catalyst. It\u2019s odd to me that I rarely see any chatter on them though other than here (I have been a long time lurker between here and advfn but only recently created account here). Their social media updates seem to recycle the same quotes too which is a bit ... boring. I think their branding style etc. is great though, just not much for them to report at the minute it seems!",

          "content": "That default rate is not high. Also read the below from recent broker note, lots of the defaulted loans are actually paid back. Aside from the Algorithm, Zaim also screen against several databases, including CBR blacklists, criminal databases (both national and international), and sanctions lists. An important consideration to make is that due to Zaim\u2019s CBR regulated status, any borrower who defaults on a Zaim loan is put on the aforementioned CBR blacklist. Not only are individuals on this list unable to access financial services from any regulated entity, but also forbidden from leaving the country or working in the public sector. Since the defaulting loan needs repaid in order for an individual to be removed from the blacklist, Zaim consistently see customers repaying debts which had been written off, and can therefore count these repayments as extraordinary revenue items for accounting purposes. In 2018, Zaim reported an 8% default rate for existing customers, and a 38% default rate for new customers. Given that the company has stated a 50:50 split between these two groups, an average total default rate of 23% can be inferred. Whilst this might seem high, the company also reported that 89% of loans issued in 2018 were repaid. Note that this implies 11% outstanding loans in default, and therefore that over half of loans written off as bad debt were in fact repaid within the calendar year. This incentive to repay bad debts, combined with the risk mitigation provided by the Credit Scoring Algorithm, allow Zaim to operate without any use of repossession services or repeat calling to debtors, either of which might be considered uncompliant or a punishable abuse of power upon examination by the CBR.",

The 'free float' of the remainder may actually be relatively small. I think Zaim SA is the counterparty for the bond but my knowledge of the structure is very limited. These are listed as being under the control of the CEO Siro Ciccone. I would like to invest more (currently in for 1m shares) but do see it as a long term investment and need other things to platy out shorter term to make a further purchase.

          "content": "That default rate is not high. Also read the below from recent broker note, lots of the defaulted loans are actually paid back. Aside from the Algorithm, Zaim also screen against several databases, including CBR blacklists, criminal databases (both national and international), and sanctions lists. An important consideration to make is that due to Zaim\u2019s CBR regulated status, any borrower who defaults on a Zaim loan is put on the aforementioned CBR blacklist. Not only are individuals on this list unable to access financial services from any regulated entity, but also forbidden from leaving the country or working in the public sector. Since the defaulting loan needs repaid in order for an individual to be removed from the blacklist, Zaim consistently see customers repaying debts which had been written off, and can therefore count these repayments as extraordinary revenue items for accounting purposes. In 2018, Zaim reported an 8% default rate for existing customers, and a 38% default rate for new customers. Given that the company has stated a 50:50 split between these two groups, an average total default rate of 23% can be inferred. Whilst this might seem high, the company also reported that 89% of loans issued in 2018 were repaid. Note that this implies 11% outstanding loans in default, and therefore that over half of loans written off as bad debt were in fact repaid within the calendar year. This incentive to repay bad debts, combined with the risk mitigation provided by the Credit Scoring Algorithm, allow Zaim to operate without any use of repossession services or repeat calling to debtors, either of which might be considered uncompliant or a punishable abuse of power upon examination by the CBR.",

There is a nice pie here: https://www.zaimcreditsystemsplc.com/shareholder_structure I think from time to time some of these shares linked to the bond may swap owners. The 'free float' of the remainder may actually be relatively small. I think Zaim SA is the counterparty for the bond but my knowledge of the structure is very limited. These are listed as being under the control of the CEO Siro Ciccone. I would like to invest more (currently in for 1m shares) but do see it as a long term investment and need other things to platy out shorter term to make a further purchase.

Very comfortable sitting on this one just, once you do your research on it it\u2019s a waiting game from then on.

Aside from the Algorithm, Zaim also screen against several databases, including CBR blacklists, criminal databases (both national and international), and sanctions lists. An important consideration to make is that due to Zaim\u2019s CBR regulated status, any borrower who defaults on a Zaim loan is put on the aforementioned CBR blacklist. Not only are individuals on this list unable to access financial services from any regulated entity, but also forbidden from leaving the country or working in the public sector. Since the defaulting loan needs repaid in order for an individual to be removed from the blacklist, Zaim consistently see customers repaying debts which had been written off, and can therefore count these repayments as extraordinary revenue items for accounting purposes. In 2018, Zaim reported an 8% default rate for existing customers, and a 38% default rate for new customers. Given that the company has stated a 50:50 split between these two groups, an average total default rate of 23% can be inferred. Whilst this might seem high, the company also reported that 89% of loans issued in 2018 were repaid. Note that this implies 11% outstanding loans in default, and therefore that over half of loans written off as bad debt were in fact repaid within the calendar year. This incentive to repay bad debts, combined with the risk mitigation provided by the Credit Scoring Algorithm, allow Zaim to operate without any use of repossession services or repeat calling to debtors, either of which might be considered uncompliant or a punishable abuse of power upon examination by the CBR.",

This made me anxious that some turnover and transactions could be diverted thereby. I texted Mr Cicconi on 13 November with a request for clarification as to which ones are the property of the A.I.M. listed Zaim; as of 22 November I have not received a reply. Does anyone know the answer? I like the look of the company but strange things happen in Russia. Also, any views on post-Covid-19 prospects of this company?",
