On a like-for-like basis\u00b2 (\"LFL\"), NFI increased by 7% YoY to \u00a320.2m, driven by strong contract performance across core growth sectors.\n\u00b7\nLFL contract NFI increased by 13% YoY, reflecting increased activity levels in our core sectors.\n\u00b7\nPermanent fees were stable with LFL permanent NFI up 2% YoY.\n\u00b7\nLFL Statement of Work (\"SoW\") NFI was down due to timing delays on major client programmes, with activity expected to remain subdued in the second half of the year.\n\u00b7\nTotal Group sales headcount at 31 January 2026 reduced by 6% YoY. The Group continued to focus on operational efficiency and disciplined resource allocation, while maintaining investment in target sectors. Sales-to-Support mix remained at 71:29 (31 January 2025: 71:29).\n\u00b7\nThe Group expects to report statutory net cash as at 31 January 2026 of \u00a313.0m (31 January 2025: net cash of \u00a316.8m). Reduction in net cash during period reflects:\n- Working capital absorption as contractors numbers have increased;\n- Consideration paid for InfoSec acquisition; and\n- Final dividend payment in respect of FY25.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nGroup guidance for FY26 adjusted profit before tax expected to be \u00a34.5m.\n\u00b7\nThe Group's ambition for FY26 remains to invest in identified markets, adding capable experienced sales consultants and growing our sales headcount by 10%.\n\u00b7\nThe Group expects to announce an interim dividend at its Interim Results.\nNotice of Interim Results\nThe Group will announce its results for the six months to 31 January 2026 on Tuesday 24 March 2026.\nMatthew Wragg, Chief Executive Officer said:\n\"I am pleased to see our positive momentum continue to build and to report that the Group is trading ahead of expectations. Our strategic investments in growth opportunities are delivering and we have the majority of our sectors experiencing year on year growth.\nThe InfoSec team have performed well and enhanced the Group's cyber capability contributing positively to contract momentum during the period and was fully integrated in the Group's systems during H1.\nWith a strengthened technology platform, growing customer base and improving operational efficiency, I remain confident in the Group's ability to deliver sustainable growth\n.\"\n1.\nNFI is calculated as revenue less contractor payroll costs.\n2. On 4 August 2025, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of InfoSec People Limited, a specialist cyber security recruitment consultancy company based in the UK. The total consideration was \u00a32.1m, comprising an initial payment of \u00a31.5m and deferred consideration of up to \u00a30.6m, payable over the next four years and subject to performance criteria being met by InfoSec People.\nFor further information please contact:\nGattaca plc\nMatthew Wragg, Chief Executive Officer\nOliver Whittaker, Chief Financial Officer\n+44 (0) 148 989 8989\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nEdward Mansfield\nWill King\n+44 (0) 203 100 2000\nIFC Advisory (Financial PR and IR)\nTim Metcalfe\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Chandler\n+44 (0) 203 934 6632\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
