David was a cofounder and chairman of Petrel Resources Plc, cofounder and chairman of Clontarf Energy Plc, a cofounder and director of Botswana Diamonds Plc and founder chairman of Greenore Gold Plc.\nDavid, aged 66 at the time of his death, was born in Belfast, had his Primary Education in Dublin, his High School in British Colombia, received a first-class honours law graduate from Cambridge in England and obtained a Master's in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.\nHis early professional career was overseas with the Boston Consulting Group. He returned to Ireland in 1991 to pursue his interest in Natural Resources. After a short period with Goffs, he joined Kenmare Resources where he became Commercial Director until 1992 when he joined John Teeling and Jim Finn with their stable of resource companies based in Clontarf, in Dublin.\nJohn Teeling and Jim Finn, in a joint comment, \"The death of David Horgan is a deep personal loss to each of us. In over three decades together we have created, financed, managed and listed a series of early-stage exploration ventures in a variety of natural resources. He revelled in high stakes, high risk resources exploration. He was fearless travelling in dangerous territories, traipsing across swamps or exploring long abandoned mines. He spoke eight languages. After ten days or so in a new country he could converse with locals in their own language and actively participate in local culture and traditions.\nEarly-stage exploration is very high risk. Our small group had some successes operating gold mines in Zimbabwe, selling off oil licences in Peru and discovering a diamond mine in Botswana. The last decade has been hard on explorers. Little or no investor interest in our activities. David had a simple message - no exploration, no mines, no transition to green energy. His passing, just as the message seems to be getting traction, is ironic. He is a huge loss for his friends, family, colleagues, shareholders and the wider Irish Resource sector.\nAr dheis de go raibh a ainm\".\nFollowing the loss of David, it is intended that Jim Finn will join the Petrel board.

There has also been rising interest in energy minerals, from coal to Helium, Lithium and Rare Earths. After a long depression there is rising acceptance that under-exploration since the great financial crisis is causing shortages. So far, the effect has been most dramatic in commodity metals, like gold and copper, but similar trends are emerging elsewhere.\nDuring 2024/25 there has been a quiet swing back to reliable fuels. Investment into renewables continues - boosting demand for minerals, but it is now quietly backed up by reliable fuels. Major energy companies are re-focusing on their cash-generative business, and increasingly stress that this relies on continuation of heavy state subsidies, enhanced prices for consumers and other supports. As a result, fossil fuels continue to grow by circa 1% yearly, and constitute 86% of primary energy supply (EI methodology calculation, 2025).\nIt is still cheaper to find oil & gas in financial markets than by exploration - though mega-mergers are sensitive.\nThe European majors who most championed the Green Transition, especially BP and Shell, had been most heavily penalised by financial markets and have now corrected course most vigorously.\nMajors are still focused on their core assets in priority basins. They are mostly not entering new basins and are still not heavy participants in farm-in markets. Yet this will change as the cycle progresses.\nBoth these trends are positive for Petrel: our core business is acquiring high-potential acreage in the Middle East or other neglected area, but to monetise these assets we need either to fund at a premium or farm-out to majors at a premium.\nYet as a long-standing player in industrial minerals, and participants in the EU Commission's Critical Resource Minerals initiative, we can see the West's desperate need to secure independent access both to key deposits as well as processing capacity to deliver high-quality raw materials for the high-tech, defence and Green Transition sectors.\nFiscal terms remain a challenge, as do demands for up-front cash for new acreage. But recent discussions suggest a new realism in how governments are engaging with juniors.\nAccordingly the key ingredients may be finally falling into place for greater stock market and farm-out support of juniors embarking on new frontier projects.\nPetrel has been investigating acquisition and organic growth opportunities in diverse energy-related sectors and countries. These must be backed by finance and proper legal title. Initial review work gives our experts confidence in the reserve and resource numbers. Potential offtake agreements - both for the EU, as well as China and India are economic at current prices. These are Petrel's strengths.\nBased on initial discussions, we do not see offtake, financing, and permitting as insurmountable obstacles in such critical resources.\nFinancing\nThe directors, and their supporters, have funded working capital needs, and are prepared to participate in any necessary future fundings.\nThe board expects to add another one or more Non-Executive Director with the next major deal.\nDavid Horgan\nChairman\n17 September 2025\nENDS\nFor further information please visit\nhttp://www.petrelresources.com/\nor contact:\nPetrel Resources\nDavid Horgan, Chairman\nJohn Teeling, Director\n+353 (0) 1 833 2833\nStrand Hanson Limited -\nNominated &\nFinancial Adviser\nRichard Johnson\nJames Bellman\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nNovum Securities Limited - Broker\nColin Rowbury\n+44 (0)\n20 399 9400\nBlytheRay - PR\nMegan Ray\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nTeneo\nLuke Hogg\nMolly Mooney\n+353 (0) 1 661 4055\nPetrel Resources plc\nFinancial Information (Unaudited)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSix Months Ended\nYear Ended\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\nAdministrative expenses\n(191)\n(155)\n(283)\nImpairment of exploration and evaluation assets\n(93)\n(74)\n(187)\nOPERATING LOSS\n(284)\n(229)\n(470)\nLoss due to fair value volatility of warrants\n(73)\n-\n-\nLOSS BEFORE TAXATION\n(357)\n(229)\n(470)\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\n-\nLOSS FOR THE PERIOD\n(357)\n(229)\n(470)\nOther comprehensive income\n-\n-\n-\nTOTAL COMPREHENSIVE PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD\n(357)\n(229)\n(470)\nLOSS PER SHARE - basic and diluted\n(0.18c)\n(0.12c)\n(0.26c)\nCONDENSED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\nASSETS:\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nIntangible assets\n467\n672\n560\n467\n672\n560\nCURRENT ASSETS\nTrade and other receivables\n62\n22\n9\nCash and cash equivalents\n42\n13\n5\n104\n35\n14\nTOTAL ASSETS\n571\n707\n574\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nTrade and other payables\n(1,147)\n(1,057)\n(1,165)\nWarrants\n(73)\n-\n-\n(1,220)\n(1,057)\n(1,165)\nNET CURRENT LIABILITIES\n(1,116)\n(1,022)\n(1,151)\nNET ASSETS\n(649)\n(350)\n(591)\nEQUITY\nShare capital\n2,596\n2,298\n2,298\nCapital conversion reserve fund\n8\n8\n8\nCapital redemption reserve\n209\n209\n209\nShare premium\n21,865\n21,864\n21,864\nShare based payment reserve\n27\n27\n27\nRetained deficit\n(25,354)\n(24,756)\n(24,997)\nTOTAL EQUITY\n(649)\n(350)\n(591)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nCapital\nCapital\nShare based\nShare\nShare\nRedemption\nConversion\nPayment\nRetained\nTotal\nCapital\nPremium\nReserves\nReserves\nReserves\nLosses\nEquity\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\nAs at 1 January 2024\n2,236\n21,820\n209\n8\n27\n(24,527)\n(227)\nIssue of shares\n62\n44\n106\nTotal comprehensive income\n-\n(229)\n(229)\nAs at 30 June 2024\n2,298\n21,864\n209\n8\n27\n(24,756)\n(350)\nIssue of shares\n-\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income\n-\n(241)\n(241)\nAs at 31 December 2024\n2,298\n21,864\n209\n8\n27\n(24,997)\n(591)\nIssue of shares\n298\n1\n299\nTotal comprehensive income\n-\n(357)\n(357)\nAs at 30 June 2025\n2,596\n21,865\n209\n8\n27\n(25,354)\n(649)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW\nSix Months Ended\nYear Ended\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\nunaudited\nunaudited\naudited\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\nCASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nLoss for the period\n(357)\n(229)\n(470)\nImpairment\n93\n74\n187\nFair Value movements of Warrants\n73\n-\n-\nForeign exchange\n-\n1\n1\n(191)\n(154)\n(282)\n(Decrease)/increase in trade and other payables\n(18)\n38\n145\n(Increase)/decrease in trade and other receivables\n(53)\n(12)\n1\nCASH USED IN OPERATIONS\n(71)\n26\n146\nNET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n(262)\n(128)\n(136)\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nShares issued\n299\n106\n106\nNET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n299\n106\n106\nNET INCREASE/(DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n37\n(22)\n(30)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n5\n36\n36\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies\n-\n(1)\n(1)\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT AT THE END OF THE PERIOD\n42\n13\n5\nNotes:\n1.

GOING CONCERN\nThe Group incurred a loss for the financial period of \u20ac356,791 (year ended 31 December 2024: loss of \u20ac469,878) and had net current liabilities of \u20ac1,115,358 (31 December 2024: \u20ac1,150,434) at the balance sheet date. These conditions as well as those noted below represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nIncluded in current liabilities is an amount of \u20ac1,082,531 (31 December 2024: \u20ac1,037,531) owed to key management personnel in respect of remuneration due at the balance sheet date. Key management have confirmed that they will not seek settlement of these amounts in cash for a period of at least one year after the date of approval of the financial statements or until the Group has generated sufficient funds from its operations after paying its third party creditors.\nThe Group and Company had a cash balance of \u20ac42,497 (31 December 2024: \u20ac4,838) at the balance sheet date. The directors have prepared cashflow projections for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements which indicate that additional finance will be required to fund working capital requirements and develop existing projects. As the Group is not revenue or cash generating it relies on raising capital from the public market. On 6 March 2025 the Company raised \u20ac298,586 (\u00a3250,000) via a placing of shares.\nThese conditions as well as those noted below represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs in previous years the Directors have given careful consideration to the appropriateness of the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements and believe the going concern basis is appropriate for these financial statements. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\n4. LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing the loss after taxation for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the loss after taxation for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that were outstanding during the year.\nThe following table sets out the computation for basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS):\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\n\u20ac\nLoss per share - Basic and Diluted\n(0.18c)\n(0.12c)\n(0.26c)\nBasic and diluted loss per share\nThe earnings and weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of basic loss per share are as follows:\nNumerator\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\nLoss for the period\n(357)\n(229)\n(470)\nDenominator\nNumber\nNumber\nNumber\nWeighted average number of shares\n199,005,524\n183,693,718\n183,803,307\nBasic and diluted loss per share are the same as the effect of the outstanding share options is anti-dilutive.\n5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n30 June 25\n30 June 24\n31 Dec 24\nExploration and evaluation assets:\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\n\u20ac'000\nOpening balance\n560\n746\n746\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\nImpairment\n(93)\n(74)\n(187)\nClosing balance\n467\n672\n560\nExploration and evaluation assets relate to expenditure incurred in exploration in Ghana. The directors are aware that by its nature there is an inherent uncertainty in Exploration and evaluation assets and therefore inherent uncertainty in relation to the carrying value of capitalized exploration and evaluation assets.\nDuring 2018 the Group resolved the outstanding issues with the Ghana National Petroleum Company (GNPC) regarding a contract for the development of the Tano 2A Block. The Group has signed a Petroleum Agreement in relation to the block and this agreement awaits ratification by the Ghanian government.\nAs ratification has not yet been achieved in the current year the directors, as a matter of prudence, opted to write down 20% of the carrying value of the Tano 2A Block historic expenditure annually. Accordingly, an impairment charge of \u20ac93,316 was recorded in the current period to 30 June 2025. (FY 2024: \u20ac186,633).\nRelating to the remaining exploration and evaluation assets at the financial year end, the directors believe there were no facts or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the intangible assets may exceed their recoverable amount and thus no impairment review was deemed necessary by the directors. The realisation of these intangible assets is dependent on the successful discovery and development of economic reserves and is subject to a number of significant potential risks, as set out below:\n\u00b7\nLicence obligations;\n\u00b7\nExchange rate risks;\n\u00b7\nUncertainty over development and operational costs;\n\u00b7\nPolitical and legal risks, including arrangements with Governments for licences, profit sharing and taxation;\n\u00b7\nForeign investment risks including increases in taxes, royalties and renegotiation of contracts;\n\u00b7\nFinancial risk management;\n\u00b7\nGoing concern and\n\u00b7\nAbility to raise finance.\n6.

Each Placing Share has one warrant attached with the right to subscribe for one new ordinary share at 2p per new ordinary share for a period of two years.\n7.

But there has been strong demand growth for energy minerals. As shown in trade negotiations, economic powers are keen to secure sources and processing capacity of Critical Resource Minerals.\"\nSince the 1990s, most discoveries have been achieved by junior explorers. This cycle seems to be repeating, as majors and NOCs retrench, leaving the upside to daring independents.\nPetrel is considering expansion opportunities into energy minerals, for which there is market and government support - provided the projects come with satisfactory title, finance and meet governance standards.\"\nNo new price-sensitive information was shared as part of this briefing as compared to that disclosed in the Company's 2024 Annual Report, which is available on its website.\nEnds\nPetrel Resources\nDavid Horgan, Chairman\n+353 (0) 1 833 2833\nJohn Teeling, Director\nStrand Hanson Limited -\nNominated &\nFinancial Adviser\nRichard Johnson\nJames Bellman\nRobert Collins\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nNovum Securities Limited - Broker\nColin Rowbury\n+44 (0)\n20 399 9400\nBlytheRay - PR\nMegan RayMadeleine Gordon-Foxwell\n+44 (0) 207 138 3206\n+44 (0) 207 138 3553\n+44 (0) 207 138 3208\nTeneo\nFia Long\nAlan Reynolds\nLuke Hogg\nAlan Tyrrell\n+353 (0) 1 661 4055\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
