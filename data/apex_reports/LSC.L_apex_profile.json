UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nLondon Security PLC\n(the \"Group\" or \"Company\")\nInterim results for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nChairman's statement\nJ-J. Murray, Chairman\nFInancial Highlights\n\u2022 Revenue \u00a3116.9m (2024: \u00a3110.9m)\n\u2022 Operating profit \u00a312.4m (2024: \u00a313.4m)\n\u2022 Earnings per share 70.8p (2024: 78.4p)\nTrading\nThe financial highlights illustrate that the Group's revenue increased by \u00a36.0 million (5.4%) to \u00a3116.9 million.\nOperating profit decreased by \u00a31.0 million (7.5%) to \u00a312.4 million.\nThese results include the adverse movement in the Euro to Sterling average exchange rate, which has increased from 1.17 to 1.19. If the 2025 results from the European subsidiaries had been translated at 2024 rates, revenue would have been \u00a3118.5 million instead of \u00a3116.9 million, which would represent an increase of 6.9% on the prior year. On the same basis, operating profit would have been \u00a312.6 million instead of \u00a312.4 million.\nThe main factors behind the decline in operating profit have been identified as a shortage of engineers, the increased costs of employing engineers and ongoing inflation.\nManagement have addressed the shortage of engineers with a recruitment drive in the first quarter of 2025. After an initial period of training these new engineers are now servicing the Group's customers. Their performance is expected to accelerate through the year ahead with active mentoring and further training from their field service managers.\nAlthough inflation has moderated since last year, the Group continues to experience upward input price pressures. These supply price increases have been passed on to the Group's customers where possible.\nAcquisitions\nIn the six months to the end of June, the Group strengthened its presence in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom through the acquisition of service contracts to be integrated into the Group's existing subsidiaries. It remains a principal aim of the Group to grow through acquisition. Acquisitions are being sought throughout Europe and the Group will invest at the upper end of the price spectrum where an adequate return is envisaged by the Board.\nCash and financing\nThe Group's cash balance at 30 June 2025 was \u00a342.7 million. This is an increase of \u00a313.1 million on the 31 December 2024 balance of \u00a329.6 million. This partially reflects the success in collecting trade receivables that increased in quarters 3 and 4 of 2024 following the introduction of a new IT system, which was discussed in the Annual Report's Financial Review.\nProspects\nAll the countries in which the Group operates are experiencing low or no growth. However, demand for the Group's products and services remains strong as they are non-discretionary expenditure items. The London Security Group has a healthy balance sheet, strong cash reserves and a track record for good cash generation. The Board therefore considers that with its strong balance sheet and material net cash position the Group is well placed to cope with a period of low growth.\nDividends\nA final dividend in respect of 2024 of \u00a30.42 per ordinary share was paid to shareholders on 11 July 2025.\nJ-J.

financial statements\nfor the six months ended 30 June 2025\n1 Nature of information\nThe financial information contained in this Interim Statement has been neither audited nor reviewed by the auditor and does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 has been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Group's published consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. The principal risks and uncertainties as disclosed in the year end accounts are considered to be consistent with those that are still applicable now.\nComparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been extracted from the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024, which have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The Independent Auditor's Report on those accounts was unqualified and did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph or any statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\n2 Basis of preparation\nThe preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n3 Earnings per share\nThe calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit on ordinary activities after taxation of \u00a38,685,000 (2024: \u00a39,590,000) and on 12,259,877 (2024: 12,259,877) ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.\nFor diluted earnings per ordinary share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. There was no difference in the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share as there are no potentially dilutive shares outstanding.\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nsix months\nsix months\nyear\nended\nended\nended\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n2025\n2024\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfit on ordinary activities after taxation\n8,685\n9,590\n21,665\nBasic earnings per ordinary share\n70.8p\n78.4p\n176.7p\n4 Actuarial valuation of the pension scheme\nAs permitted under IAS 19 the Group has not prepared an actuarial valuation of the pension scheme assets and liabilities for the Interim Statement 2025. In accordance with IAS 19 such a valuation will be prepared for the purposes of the Group's Annual Report and Accounts 2025.\nFor further information, please contact:\nLondon Security plc\nRichard Pollard\nCompany Secretary Tel : 01422 372852\nZeus Capital Limited\nDarshan Patel / George Duxberry Tel : 0203 829 5000\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nFinal Results for the Year Ended 31 December 2024\nChairman's statement\nJ.J. Murray, Chairman\nFinancial Highlights\nFinancial highlights of the audited\u00a0results for the year ended 31\u00a0December 2024 compared with the year ended 31 December 2023 are as follows:\n\u2022 revenue of \u00a3220.7\u00a0million (2023:\u00a0\u00a3219.7\u00a0million),\n\u2022 operating profit of \u00a329.7\u00a0million (2023: \u00a331.6\u00a0million),\n\u2022 profit for the year of \u00a321.7\u00a0million (2023: \u00a323.3\u00a0million),\n\u2022 cash of \u00a329.6\u00a0million (2023:\u00a0\u00a332.7\u00a0million),\n\u2022 earnings per share for the year of \u00a31.77 (2023: \u00a31.90) and\n\u2022 a dividend per share of \u00a31.22 (2023: \u00a31.24).\nTrading review\nThe financial highlights illustrate that the Group's revenue increased by \u00a31.0\u00a0million (0.5%) to \u00a3220.7\u00a0million and operating profit decreased by \u00a31.8\u00a0million (5.7%) to \u00a329.8 million. These results reflect:\n\u2022 The movement in the Euro to Sterling average exchange rate, which had an adverse effect of \u00a34.6\u00a0million on reported revenue and \u00a30.8\u00a0million on operating profit. A more detailed review of this year's performance is given in the Financial Review and the\u00a0Strategic Report.\n\u2022 2024 was a period of consolidation for the Group following the 16.2% increase in operating profit that was enjoyed in 2023. Whilst operating profit has decreased versus 2023, this still represents a 9.2% increase on 2022.\n\u2022 The core servicing business remains very consistent with a slight fall in special projects, the instance of which is unpredictable.\n\u2022 Although inflation has moderated since last year, we continue to experience upward input price pressures. These supply price increases have been passed on to our customers where possible. Business confidence is low and is depressing growth and reducing\nour customers' appetite to invest. All the countries in which we operate are experiencing low or no growth.\nAcquisitions\nIt remains a principal aim of the Group to grow through acquisition. Acquisitions are being sought throughout Europe and the Group will invest at prices where an adequate return is envisaged by the Board. In the year under review the Group completed the acquisition of service contracts from smaller well-established businesses for integration into the Group's existing subsidiaries and has grown its presence in Austria, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany.\nManagement and staff\n2024 was a year in which the staff performed well and, on behalf of the shareholders, I would like to express thanks and appreciation for their contribution. The Group recognises that we can only achieve our aims with talented and dedicated colleagues who provide outstanding customer service in every area of the business.\nDividends\nAn interim dividend in respect of 2024 of \u00a30.80 per ordinary share was paid to shareholders on 29 November 2024. The Board is recommending the payment of a final dividend in respect of 2024 of \u00a30.42 per ordinary share. This would be paid on 12 July 2025 to shareholders on the register on 13 June 2025 with the shares marked ex-dividend on 12 June 2025.\nFuture prospects\nThe markets in which we operate are entering what is likely to be a period of low growth. The London Security Group however has a healthy balance sheet, strong cash reserves and a track record for good cash generation. The Board therefore considers that the Group is well placed to weather any downturn. We will also continue to invest in our future and the Group plans to continue to grow through acquisitions.\nAnnual General Meeting\nThe Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\") will be held at 2 Jubilee Way, Elland, West Yorkshire HX5 9DY, on 25 June 2025 at 11.30 am. The Company confirms that shareholders are able to attend in person should they wish to do so. However, we strongly encourage shareholders to vote on all resolutions by completing the enclosed form of proxy for use at that Meeting, which you are requested to return in accordance with the instructions on the form.\nJ-J.
