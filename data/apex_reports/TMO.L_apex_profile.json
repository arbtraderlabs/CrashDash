The Company cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as \"aim\", \"anticipate\", \"target\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"goal\", \"believe\", or other words of similar meaning. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances, including, but not limited to, economic and business conditions, the effects of continued volatility in credit markets, market-related risks such as changes in the price of commodities or changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in legislation, the further development of standards and interpretations under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"\nIFRS\n\") applicable to past, current and future periods, evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of standards under IFRS, the outcome of pending and future litigation or regulatory investigations, the success of future explorations, acquisitions and other strategic transactions and the impact of competition. A number of these factors are beyond the Company's control. As a result, the Company's actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the Company's forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made in this Announcement by or on behalf of the Company speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required by the FCA, the London Stock Exchange or applicable law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this Announcement to reflect any changes in the Company's expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nThis Announcement is for information purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to buy, sell, issue, or subscribe for, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, sell, issue, or subscribe for any securities, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unauthorised or unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

This would require a surprise in the Q2 results or a new partnership announcement that materially changes the revenue outlook.",
      "bear_case": "The lack of market buzz, zero search interest, and a flat social media presence mean there is no organic demand for the stock. The company is still raising capital at a price that suggests it may not be able to generate sustainable cash flows, and the board is busy with regulatory filings rather than product milestones.",
      "risk_reward": "The risk is high\u2014any negative news could push the price back to zero\u2014while the upside is limited to a modest recovery if a revenue surprise occurs. Overall, the risk/reward is unattractive for a speculative trade."

      "if_watching": "Hold off until Q2 results are released. If the company reports any positive cash\u2011flow or a revenue print, consider entering on a dip but keep the position size minimal.",

    "bottom_line": "Pass for now\u2014there is no traction, no catalysts, and the stock is effectively a speculative ticket that would only pay off if a revenue surprise materialises."
