The Company cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as \"aim\", \"anticipate\", \"target\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"goal\", \"believe\", or other words of similar meaning. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances, including, but not limited to, economic and business conditions, the effects of continued volatility in credit markets, market-related risks such as changes in the price of commodities or changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in legislation, the further development of standards and interpretations under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"\nIFRS\n\") applicable to past, current and future periods, evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of standards under IFRS, the outcome of pen",

The Company will therefore be required to issue and allot a total of 102,207,069 new Ordinary Shares to satisfy the Capital Raising.\nThe Retail Offer is conditional on approval by the Company's Shareholders at a general meeting and Admission becoming effective at 8:00 am on 7 January 2026 (or such later date as the Company and its advisors may agree, but not later than 21 January 2026).\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement shall, unless defined in this announcement or unless the context provides otherwise, bear the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the 'Retail Offer' launch announcement or 'Firm Placing, Conditional Placing and Retail Offer' launch announcement released earlier today.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the 2,207,069 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM. Admission of the new Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Retail Offer is expected to take place and dealings in the new Ordinary Shares are expected to commence at 8.00 a.m. on 7 January 2026, at which time it is also expected that the new Ordinary Shares will be enabled for settlement in CREST.\nConcert Party Holding\nAs noted in the Company's 'Result of Firm and Conditional Placing' announcement released earlier today, following Second Admission, the Concert Party Group, consisting of Oakley Capital Investments Limited, Oakley Capital Limited and certain Directors, will hold 262,083,995 Ordinary Shares. In light of the number of Retail Offer Shares to be issued pursuant to the Retail Offer, the Company can now confirm that, upon Second Admission, the Concert Party Group's holding will represent 50.15 per cent. of the enlarged issued share capital.\nEnquiries:\nTime Out Group plc\nChris Ohlund, CEO\nMatt Pritchard, CFO\nSteven Tredget, Investor Relations Director\nTel: +44 (0) 207 813 3000\nRetailBook Limited\nMike Ward / James Deal\nc\napitalmarkets\n@retailbook.com\nPanmure Liberum (Nominated Adviser and Bookrunner\n)\nAndrew Godber / Edward Thomas / John More /\nPhoebe Bunce\n\u200b\nRupert Dearden / Rauf Munir\nTel: +44 (0) 203 100 2222\nFTI Consulting LLP\nEdward Bridges\nTel: +44 (0) 203 727 1000\nNotes:\nReferences to times in this Announcement are to London time unless otherwise stated.\nThe times and dates mentioned throughout this Announcement may be adjusted by the Company in which event the Company will make an appropriate announcement to a Regulatory Information Service giving details of any revised dates and the details of the new times and dates will be notified to London Stock Exchange plc (the \"\nLondon Stock Exchange\n\") and, where appropriate, Shareholders.

This also creates revenue synergies between Time Out Media and Market as advertisers can reach a valuable audience through both DOOH ('digital out of home') and in-person events - all under the trusted Time Out brand. Showcasing these unique opportunities, Time Out and Disney's\nThe Lion King\non Broadway announced a multi-month partnership with the hit stage production as the exclusive opening sponsor of the new Market.

The media business has seen a decline in traditional advertising revenue following a structural switch in consumer habits from Web to social media and AI - the Board expects this trend to continue, therefore Media opex has been materially reduced during H2 FY25, and into FY26, with \u00a34\nmillion\nof year-on year savings actioned FY26 vs FY25.\n\u00b7\nThe strategy review previously announced in May 2025 is progressing, with the evaluation of potential growth strategies to deliver sustainable Media division profitability through effective monetisation of unique content and growing global audience and driving customer visits and revenue to our Markets.\nOutlook\nThe Group remains focused on the growth that Markets will deliver with the objective of doubling Market EBITDA over the next two years, whilst improving the profitability of media, by converting a strong pipeline of potential new sites, driving like-for-like growth in existing Markets, out-of-home advertising, loyalty programmes and a growing and valuable customer database. The Group expects\nto announce the outcomes of the media review alongside the FY25 audited results this autumn.\nCommenting on the update, Chris Ohlund, CEO of Time Out Group plc, said:\n\"While Media and Market performance during June was softer than anticipated, our markets have since reverted to growth and we see considerable headroom, both through deepening our presence in existing locations and accelerating rollouts into new ones. The strategic review of Media is progressing well, with clear momentum emerging in high-value areas including social media, email engagement, and the delivery of scalable brand campaigns and live events. These strengths position us to drive sustainable revenue growth and enhanced returns for shareholders.\n\"Our audience is highly engaged and continues to seek out trusted human advice and recommendation.

This is the first time that a franchise partner in one country will not only operate Time Out Media but will also explore Time Out Market opportunities. This partnership comes at a time when we increasingly operate Media and Market -\u00a0an unmatched digital and real-life model - as one brand to cement Time Out as a unique proposition, both for consumers and commercial partners to connect with this valuable audience. We look forward to celebrating the best of India along with its vibrant cities with our curated content and experiences.\"\nRitu Kapur, Managing Director and CEO, QDL added:\n\"Urban India, especially its younger, always-curious crowd, is craving something fresh, bold, and out of the box when it comes to lifestyle and food. With Time Out, we're excited to bring a game-changing experience to the country.\n\"This partnership blends QDL's pulse on India's digital-first youth -\u00a0and also visitors to our country - with Time Out's global knack for spotlighting the best in culture, food, and city life.

Time Out Market New York, Union Square will offer\u00a0across 10,000 sq ft a curated mix of the city's top and up-and-coming culinary talents, all under one roof. There will be seven kitchens, a bar, a stage for cultural experiences and approximately 300 seats with around 70 of them on the terrace.\nThe pipeline of Markets under development consists of six Management Agreements under which the Group receives a share of revenues and profits (subject to a guaranteed consultancy fee) but does not contribute to the capital cost of the site. In contrast, Time Out Market New York, Union Square is a lease agreement and as a result will be an Owned & Operated Market, with Time Out receiving 100% of site profits. As the space previously housed a food hall and has a smaller footprint, construction capex - for which the Company raised funds last year - will be lower compared to other sites.\nChris Ohlund, CEO of Time Out Group plc said:\n\"Our medium target is 40 to 50 Market sites in top cities around the world -\u00a0this will not only enable us to generate substantial revenue growth, these Markets also offer the opportunity to become another big media channel for Time Out which currently has a global monthly brand reach of 184 million.\n\"As one of our focus areas are smaller sites in top cities, we are looking forward to opening in just a few months time our second Market in New York - this demonstrates our ability to accelerate our opening pace and the potential significant revenue synergies with our Time Out Media business.\"\nSpencer Levine, President at RAL Companies & Affiliates LLC\n:\n\"Zero Irving is an award-winning trophy asset with museum-quality office space that is 100% leased by industry-leading companies. The project is a case study in effective public/private collaboration as we worked hand-in-hand with the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) to create an ecosystem for job growth, tech innovation and a food hall. Time Out Market is a high-quality tenant perfectly positioned to run a successful operation that benefits the building's office tenants, the surrounding community, and New York City as a whole.\"\nThe existing Market portfolio and expected opening schedule based on calendar year is as follows:\nOpen Markets\nMarkets under development\nOwned & Operated\nManagement Agreements\nOwned & Operated\nManagement Agreements\n\u25cf Lisbon\n\u25cf New York, Brooklyn\n\u25cf Boston\n\u25cf Chicago\n\u25cf Porto\n\u25cf Barcelona\n\u25cf Montreal\n\u25cf Dubai\n\u25cf Cape Town\n\u25cf Bahrain\n2025\n\u25cf New York, Union Square\n2025\n\u25cf Osaka\n\u25cf Budapest\n\u25cf Vancouver\n\u25cf Abu Dhabi\n2027\n\u25cf Prague\n\u25cf Riyadh\n-ENDS-\nFor further information, please contact:\nTime Out Group plc\nTel: +44 (0) 207 813 3000\nChris Ohlund, CEO\nMatt Pritchard, CFO\nSteven Tredget, Investor Relations Director\nPanmure Liberum (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 203 100 2222\nAndrew Godber / Edward Thomas / Ailsa MacMaster / Joshua Borlant\nFTI Consulting LLP\nTel: +44 (0) 203 727 1000\nEdward Bridges / Shaliz Navab\nNotes to editors\nAbout Time Out Group\nTime Out Group is a global brand that inspires and enables people to experience the best of the city.

An initial \u00a32.1m of the instrument has been drawn to fund the Group's continued growth strategy, with potential for future further drawdowns.\nThe CLN has a maturity date of 31 December 2026 with a conversion price of 50 pence per ordinary share, a 16 per cent. premium to the closing share price as at 20 February 2025.

Post the election, there has been a material increase, with 3x more RFPs received in January than the monthly average for the previous three months.

We have already identified and actioned significant operational synergy efficiencies, which will benefit profitability in both H2 FY25 and FY26.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of the Time Out team for delivering this result.\"\nCurrent Trading and Outlook\nThe Group has a clear plan to drive like for like growth in existing Markets, whilst continuing to convert the strong pipeline of potential new Market sites and large media advertising deals and trading for FY25 remains in line with management expectations\n.\nHaving opened seven Markets in 10 years, we expect to open seven Markets in the period from November 2023 to November 2025 and reach a minimum of 16 Markets by 2027. When coupled with a continued pipeline of new opportunities, this growth can rapidly improve the operational gearing of our fixed cost base, meaning we have the potential to continue to grow profitability at a faster rate than sales. We continue to receive approaches from commercial parties keen to work with the Time Out brand and are increasingly confident in our global strategy.\n(1) This is a non-GAAP alternative performance measure (\"APM\") that management uses to aid understanding of the underlying business performance. See appendix Alternative Performance Measures for a reconciliation to the statutory numbers.\n(2) Like-for-like revenue is calculated for comparison using FY23 foreign exchange rates to convert both FY24 and FY23 foreign currency revenues, with FY23 revenues related to Miami excluded.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA is operating loss stated before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, share-based payments, exceptional items and profit/(loss) on the disposal of fixed assets.\n(4) Adjusted net debt excludes lease-related liabilities under IFRS 16.\n(5) Global monthly brand reach is the estimated monthly average in the year including all Owned & Operated cities and franchises.\n(6) Consistent with FY24, FY23 comparatives have been restated to present \u00a31.7m of group costs, previously recorded within Media, within corporate costs and exclude \u00a32.1m recharges between Media and Market to better represent the actual costs of the underlying segments.\n\u200b\nFor further information, please contact:\nTime Out Group plc\nTel: +44 (0)207 813 3000\nChris Ohlund, CEO\nMatt Pritchard, CFO\nSteven Tredget, Investor Relations Director\nPanmure Liberum (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)203 100 2222\nAndrew Godber / Edward Thomas\nFTI Consulting LLP\nTel: +44 (0)203 727 1000\nEdward Bridges / Fiona Walker\nNotes to editors\nAbout Time Out Group\nTime Out Group is a global media and hospitality business that inspire",
