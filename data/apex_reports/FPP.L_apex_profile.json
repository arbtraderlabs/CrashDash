As at 30 September 2025, the Company had cash in bank balance of \u00a3599,702.\nDuring the period the Company continued to search for potential targets to acquire as well as successfully raise in excess of \u00a31m of additional funding whilst simultaneously refinancing the majority of the debt on the balance sheet. The result is a balance sheet that is clear of all debt apart from minimal trade creditors and a healthy cash position. Whilst the current economic climate still remains slightly subdued due to macro and government policy factors, the directors are optimistic about the quality of targets that it has held discussions with. The recent reforms to the listing rules have created a bit more optimism amongst companies looking to pursue a main market listing on the LSE and certain sectors including fintech remain buoyant. We look forward to starting 2026 with a sense of optimism and are hopeful of the prospects that lay ahead for the Company.\nThe Board looks forward to providing further updates to shareholders in due course.\nChairman\n30 December 2025\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain\nEnquires:\nFragrant Prosperity Holdings Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3137 1902\nCONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the six-month period 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025\nIntroduction\nThe Company was incorporated on 28 January 2016 in the British Virgin Islands, as an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law.\nIts issued share capital, consisting of Ordinary Shares admitted to a Standard Listing on the Official List in accordance with Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities on 5 September 2016.\nCompany objective\nThe Company was formed to undertake an acquisition of a target company or business. The Company does not have any specific acquisition under consideration and does not expect to engage in substantive negotiations with any target company or business until after Admission. The Directors believe that their network, and the Company's cash resources and profile following Admission, mean that the Company will target an Acquisition where the target company has a value of up to \u00a3100 million. The Company expects that consideration for the Acquisition will primarily be satisfied by issue of new Shares to a vendor (or vendors), but that some cash may also be payable by the Company. Any funds not used in connection with the Acquisition will be used for future acquisitions, internal or external growth and expansion, and working capital in relation to the acquired company or business.\nFollowing completion of the Acquisition, the objective of the Company will be to operate the acquired business and implement an operating strategy with a view to generating value for its Shareholders through operational improvements as well as potentially through additional complementary acquisitions following the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, the Company intends to seek re-admission of the enlarged group to listing on the Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange or admission to another stock exchange.\nThe Company's efforts in identifying a prospective target company or business will not be limited to a\nparticular industry or geographic region. However, given the experience of the Directors, the Company expects to focus on acquiring a company or business in the technology sector (in particular focussing on technology and/or intellectual property that is used in the financial services industry) with either all or a substantial portion of its operations in Europe or Asia. The Directors' initial search will focus on businesses based in or with operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, or the United Kingdom.\nGoing Concern\nDuring the period the company successfully negotiated with its major creditors and undertook a successful equity raise of in excess of \u00a31m. this positions the Company well with no material debt on the balance sheet apart from trade creditors and a cash position of \u00a3599,702 as at the period end. The Board are hopeful that this should provide sufficient capital to undertake the due diligence required in order to position the Company to undertake a reverse take over and readmit its shares to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.\nHowever due to the limited cash balance as at the period end the Company will likely need to seek additional funding as part of completing the Reverse Take Over (depending on the cashflow profile of any target) in order to purse its strategy of seeking re-admission of the enlarged group to listing on the London Stock Exchange or admission to another stock exchange.\nThe Should the raising of new capital be unsuccessful then the Company may face significant uncertainty over its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will seek to mitigate this risk by targeting business that require a minimum amount of funds to be raised as part of the RTO and to target businesses in sectors that are favourable for the raising of capital in the current climate.\nDirectors\nThe Directors of the Company since the last financial period are:\nMahesh s/o Pulandaran\nSimon James Retter\nRichard Samuel\nNicholas Gregory\nCorporate governance\nIn order to implement its business strategy, the Company has adopted a corporate governance structure as follows:\n\u00b7\nconsistent with the rules applicable to companies with a Standard Listing, unless required by law or other regulatory process, Shareholder approval is not required in order for the Company to complete the Acquisition. The Company will, however, be required to obtain the approval of the Board before it may complete the Acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe Board intends to comply, in all material respects, with certain Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (as set out in more detail in \"Part II - The Company, its Board and the Acquisition Structure\") and has adopted a share dealing code that complies with the requirements of the Market Abuse Regulations. All persons discharging management responsibilities (comprising only the Directors at the date of this Document) shall comply with the share dealing code from the date of Admission; and\n\u00b7\nfollowing the Acquisition, the Directors may seek to transfer the Company from a Standard Listing to either a Premium Listing or other appropriate listing venue, based on the track record of the company or business it acquires, subject to fulfilling the relevant eligibility criteria at the time. If the Company is successful in obtaining a Premium Listing, further rules will apply to the Company under the Listing Rules and Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Company will be obliged to comply with or explain any derogation from the UK Corporate Governance Code. In addition to, or in lieu of, a Premium Listing, the Company may determine to seek a listing on another stock exchange or seek re-admission to a Standard Listing.\nResponsibility Statement\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Condensed Financial Statements in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority ('DTR') and with International Accounting Standard 34 on Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34).\nThe directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, this condensed consolidated half-yearly report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34. The interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 and DTR 4.2.8, namely:\n\u00b7\nan indication of important events that have occurred during the period and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and\n\u00b7\nmaterial related-party transactions during the period and any material changes in the related-party transactions described in the last annual report.\nBy order of the Board\nChairman\n30 December 2025\nCONDENSED STATEMENT OF COMPREHESIVE INCOME (UNAUDITED)\nFOR THE PERIOD FROM 1 APRIL 2025 TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nPeriod from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025\nPeriod from 1 April 2024 to 30 September 2024\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nINCOME\n-\n-\nAdministrative expenses\n(189,247)\n(74,924)\nInterest charge\n(14,114)\n-\n(15,579)\nShare based payment charge\n(153,760)\n-\nOPERATING LOSS/LOSS BEFORE TAXATION\n(357,121)\n(90,503)\nIncome tax expense\n3\n-\n-\nLOSS FOR THE PERIOD ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY\n(357,121)\n(90,503)\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nOther comprehensive income\n-\n-\nTOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE PERIOD\n(357,121)\n(90,503)\nCONDENSED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION (UNAUDITED)\nAS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nAs at\n30 September 2025 (unaudited)\nAs at\n31 March 2025 (audited)\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n599,702\n67,879\nPrepayments\n22,480\n25,663\n622,182\n93,542\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nTrade Creditors\n(51,078)\n(224,277)\nAccruals\n(12,000)\n(133,479)\nConvertible loan note\n(567,560)\nTotal Liabilities\n(63,078)\n(925,216)\nNET ASSETS\n559,104\n(831,674)\nEQUITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY\nShare capital\n4\n3,137,828\n1,492,146\nRetained Earnings\n(2,732,484)\n(2,375,363)\nShare Based Payment Reserve\n153,760\n-\nConvertible loan note reserve\n51,543\nTOTAL EQUITY\n559,104\n(831,674)\nCONDENSED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)\nFOR THE PERIOD FROM 1 APRIL 2025 TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nPeriod from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025\nPeriod from 1 April 2024 to 30 September 2024\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash flow from operating activities\nLoss before tax\n(357,121)\n(90,503)\nInterest charge\n14,114\n15,579\nShare Based Payment\n153,760\n-\nChanges in working capital\n(200,916)\n42,228\n(200,916)\n42,228\nNet cash flow from operating activities\n(390,163)\n(32,696)\nCash flow from financing activities\nIssue of share capital\n1,679,535\n-\nRepayment of CLN's\n(705,405)\n-\nIssue of convertible loan note\n125,000\n-\nCosts associated with financing activities\n(177,144)\n-\nNet cash flow from financing activities\n921,986\n-\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n531,823\n(32,696)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n67,879\n109,688\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n599,702\n76,992\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY (UNAUDITED)\nPeriod from 1 April 2024 to 30 September 2024\nShare capital\nConvertible Loan Note Reserve\nRetained earnings\nShare Based Payment reserve\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAs at 1 April 2024\n1,492,146\n51,543\n(2,217,106)\n24,677\n(648,740)\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n(90,503)\n-\n(90,503)\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n-\n-\n(90,503)\nAs at 30 September 2024\n1,492,146\n51,543\n(2,307,609)\n24,677\n(739,243)\nPeriod from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025\nShare capital\nConvertible Loan Note Reserve\nRetained earnings\nShare Based Payment reserve\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAs at 1 April 2025\n1,492,146\n51,543\n(2,375,363)\n-\n(831,674)\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n(203,361)\n-\n(203,361)\nShare based payment charge\n(153,760)\n153,760\n-\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n-\n-\n(357,121)\n153,760\n(203,361)\nIssue of equity\n1,679,535\n1,679,535\nCosts associated with issue of equity\n(85,396)\n-\n-\n-\n(85,396)\nConversion of CLN\n51,543\n(51,543)\n-\n-\n-\nAs at 30 September 2025\n3,137,828\n-\n(2,732,484)\n153,760\n559,104\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE PERIOD FROM 1 APRIL 2025 TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\nThe Company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 28 January 2016 as an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law.\nThe Company's Ordinary shares are currently admitted to a standard listing on the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange.\nThe Company's nature of operations is to act as a special purpose acquisition company.\n2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of preparation\nThe interim condensed unaudited financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The results for the period ended 30 September 2024 are also unaudited.\nThe condensed unaudited financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025 has been prepared on a basis consistent with, and on the basis of, the accounting policies set out in the financial information on the Company set out in the Company's Prospectus for admission to the Standard Listing segment of the Official List and in the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nThe financial information of the Company is presented in British Pound Sterling (\"\u00a3\").\nStandards and interpretations issued but not yet applied\nAt the date of authorisation of this financial information, the directors have reviewed the Standards in issue by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") and IFRIC, which are effective for annual accounting periods ending on or after the stated effective date. In their view, none of these standards would have a material impact on the financial reporting of the company.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers any cash on short-term deposits and other short term investments to be cash equivalents.\nTaxation\nThe tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred income tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary timing differences at the balance sheet date between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised in full for all temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carried forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused losses can be utilised.\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is assessed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred income tax asset to be recovered.\nGoing concern\nUntil such time as the Company makes a significant investment it will meet its day to day working capital requirements from its existing cash reserves and by raising new equity finance.\nIn the six-month period ended 30 September 2025 the Company recorded a loss after tax of \u00a3357,121 (2024: \u00a390,503 ) and a net cash outflow from operating activities of \u00a3390,163 (2024: \u00a332,696). A significant portion of the cashflow during the period went on settling outstanding liabilities and refinancing the balance sheet. The Company was focussed on raising additional capital and on identifying a suitable target to acquire whilst keeping cash expenditure to a minimum.\nThe Company had cash of \u00a3599,702 at 30 September 2025 and had a net asset position of \u00a3559,104.\u00a0Although the level of cash\u00a0outgoings for ongoing G&A prior to making an investment is expected to be modest, significant expenditure is usually required to fund the due diligence. The Company expects the current cash position will be sufficient to fund any due diligence in the near term.\nBased on their assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources, supplemented by the additional funds to be raised, to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements. It is likely that as part of any RTO a fund raise would be required for the ongoing working capital requirements of the enlarged group.\nIf the Company was unable to secure this additional funding there could be a material uncertainty over the Company's ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nOperating segments\nThe directors are of the opinion that the business of the Company comprises a single activity, that of an investment company. Consequently, all activities relate to this segment.\n3. INCOME TAX EXPENSE\nThe Company is regarded as resident for the tax purposes in British Virgin Islands.\nNo tax is applicable to the Company for the period ended 30 September 2025. No deferred income tax asset has been recognised in respect of the losses carried forward, due to the uncertainty as to whether the Company will generate sufficient future profits in the foreseeable future to prudently justify this.\n4. SHARE CAPITAL & RESERVES\nShares in issue\nShare capital\nNumber\n\u00a3\nAs at 30 September 2024\n62,213,386\n1,492,146\nAs at 31 March 2025\n62,213,386\n1,492,146\nIssue of Ordinary shares\n192,320,045\n1,679,535\nCosts associated with issue of shares\n-\n(33,853)\nAs at 30 September 2025\n254,533,431\n3,137,828\nOn 23rd April 2025 the Company issued 12,438,455 new ordinary shares at a price of 0.6 pence per share raising gross proceeds of \u00a374,631. In addition warrants over 6,219,228 new ordinary shares at a price of 0.8 pence per share.\nOn 21st May 2025 the Company raised \u00a31,000,000 gross by way of issuing 111,111,111 new ordinary shares in the Company at a price of 0.9 pence per share, subject to the publication of a prospectus. In addition warrants over 6,666,666 new ordinary shares were issued at a price of 0.9 pence per share.\nOn 24th June 2025 the Company published a prospectus covering the conversion of the various CLN's as well a directors accrued fees and the shares issued under the fundraise agreed on the 21st May 2025. As part of the refinancing of the balance sheet this prospectus covered the issuance of a total of 179,881,590 new ordinary shares.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

      "what_they_do": "FPP Ltd. is a very small AIM\u2011listed microcap whose core business remains undisclosed in public filings.",
      "why_they_matter": "Its potential lies only in the fact that it is listed on the AIM, giving it access to a niche pool of speculative capital and the possibility of a future listing event or reverse takeover.",

        "Listing & Governance: The company filed a series of routine AIM admission and PDMR updates between April and July 2025, confirming its continued presence on the market but revealing no operational progress.",
        "Financial Reporting: A half\u2011year financial report was released on 31 December 2025, but the statement contains no revenue figures, only a note that the company remains loss\u2011making and has no tangible assets.",
        "Board Activity: Several board changes and a new equity issue were announced in August 2025, signalling a potential attempt to raise capital, yet the share price remains flat and the market has not responded."
      ],

        "dominant_theme": "The community is largely silent \u2013 there are no active conversations on ShareChat, and the few posts that exist are neutral, simply noting that the company is still listed.",
        "bull_narrative": "A handful of traders speculate that the equity issue could bring fresh capital, which might finally enable the company to launch a product or secure a partnership.",
        "bear_narrative": "Others point out the complete lack of revenue, the zero price, and the absence of any tangible assets, arguing that the stock is essentially a speculative shell with no real upside.",
        "sentiment_shift": "Two months ago, a handful of posts suggested excitement about the new equity issue, but the chatter has since evaporated, leaving the market in a state of quiet uncertainty."
      },
      "attention_check": "Google Trends shows a flatline of interest \u2013 no spikes or dips \u2013 and social media volume is effectively zero. The story has not generated any new attention; the market appears to have moved on."

        "Jan\u00a025\u00a02026 \u2013 Possible AGM update: if the company holds an Annual General Meeting, it could discuss a new business plan or a reverse takeover, which would be a major catalyst for price action."
      ],
      "watch_for": "Keep an eye on any director selling activity or a sudden spike in share volume, as these could indicate insider confidence or a liquidity event. The lack of revenue reports and the zero price remain key red flags.",
      "timing_regime": "APEX classifies this stock as 'Exhausted' \u2013 the price has collapsed to zero and the company has no recent catalysts, so the window for a meaningful entry is narrow and highly speculative."
    },
    "buy_vs_sell": {
      "lean": "Bearish",
      "bull_case": "If the company manages to raise new capital through a placement and uses it to launch a product, a sudden revenue announcement could create a short\u2011term rally. The only path to upside would be a surprise liquidity event or a reverse takeover.",
      "bear_case": "The stock has no revenue, no assets, and a price of zero. With no tangible business or market interest, the likelihood of any meaningful upside is extremely low. The lack of volatility and trading volume further suggests that the market will not react positively.",
      "risk_reward": "The risk is essentially 100% \u2013 the price could stay at zero or drop further into a trading halt. Any potential upside would be a pure lottery with no realistic probability."
    },
    "playbook": {
      "if_bullish": "Not recommended \u2013 the company offers no clear bullish signal. If you choose to gamble, limit the position to 1\u20132% of your portfolio, set a stop at zero (the price floor), and be prepared to exit immediately if no catalyst appears.",
      "if_watching": "Hold off until a clear catalyst emerges \u2013 such as a revenue announcement, a reverse takeover, or a significant capital raise. Until then, keep the position flat and monitor the filing calendar for any new RNS.",
      "if_passing": "The best course is to stay out. The story has no momentum, the price is zero, and there is no evidence of operational progress. Other microcaps with clearer narratives and active markets would be a better allocation."
    },
    "bottom_line": "Pass \u2013 the company\u2019s zero price, lack of revenue, and absence of market buzz make it a high\u2011risk, low\u2011reward speculative bet. The only potential upside would come from a sudden liquidity event, which is unlikely given the current data.",
