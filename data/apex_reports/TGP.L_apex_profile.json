The Company will also host an investor presentation via Investor Meet Company on Thursday, 11 December 2025 at 10am GMT, with further details of this event provided below.\nSignificant \u20ac8m\nco\nntract award\nTekmar has been awarded a contract with an existing Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) customer for a major UK offshore wind farm. The project value is in excess of\n\u20ac8m\nand the scope of work includes the engineering and supply of Tekmar's 10th Generation Cable Protection System and associated cable ancillaries. The Group will deploy its in-house engineering expertise and holistic CPS design capabilities to deliver an optimised solution for the project's specific conditions. Delivery is scheduled for March 2027, with revenue recognition expected across the Group's FY26 and FY27 financial periods.\nUpdate on trading for FY25 - an improved second half performance\nThe Board expects to report revenue for the year-ended 30 September 2025 (\"FY25\") in the region of \u00a329m and above breakeven adjusted EBITDA. This is in-line with market expectations and reflects the anticipated profit weighting to the second half of FY25 (\"H2 25\"). A concerted effort was made through FY25 to develop a sustainably larger pipeline of work with a higher degree of both geographical and end market diversification. The benefit of this became increasingly apparent as the second half of FY25 progressed, with adjusted EBITDA for H2 25 showing a material improvement on the H1 25 adjusted EBITDA loss of \u00a30.7m.\nAs at 30 September 2025, net debt was \u00a32.8m.\nRecord order book and commercial momentum supports confident outlook\nSecuring higher volume and a balanced mix of work across Tekmar's end markets has been a primary objective for the business under the leadership of Richard Turner as CEO. The Board is very encouraged by the order book momentum the team is building and the progress being made.\nIncreasing order intake.\nSince 1 July 2025, Tekmar has secured new orders of c.\u00a329m. Order book as at the date of this release is 60 per cent higher than the equivalent period one year ago and a record order book for the Company since its admission to AIM in 2018. These orders will be delivered over the 2026 and 2027 financial years.\nSecuring high-quality work and a balanced portfolio.\nThe business is maintaining a disciplined commercial approach to projects and, as the volume of work grows, economies of scale give further opportunity for future margin development.\nA significant number of contract wins have been secured since the end of June 2025 that demonstrate the balanced growth Tekmar is achieving across its core energy markets including:\n-\nOffshore Wind -\nThe c.\n\u20ac8m\ncontract announced today builds on other milestone agreements announced in recent months. In October 2025, Tekmar announced a framework agreement with Jan De Nul, supporting TenneT's 2GW programme in Germany. This follows the framework agreement with Nexans, announced earlier in the year. These multi-year agreements reflect Tekmar's standing in the market and commitment to providing innovative, high-quality solutions that support the success of clients' complex projects.\n-\nOil & Gas -\nIn September 2025, Tekmar announced a US$10m contract award to provide cable protection technology for a major offshore energy project in the United Arab Emirates. This was followed by a \u20ac3.5m contract award in November 2025 with a leading global oilfield services provider in the Middle East. These contracts evidence Tekmar's successful focus on broadening its commercial activity in this very active region. Tekmar also delivered a \u00a32.0m contract in the Middle East announced in July 2025 to supply bespoke subsea infrastructure technology for a pipeline project. This also highlights the significant quick turnround work that is available to the Group.\n-\nPorts & Harbours -\nIn October 2025, Tekmar announced a $1.5m contract award for the provision of bespoke engineered scour protection and specialized deployment equipment for a new port development. The Board is anticipating further success in this growing market segment. Ports and Harbours is a significant growth opportunity for the Group, extending its asset protection expertise beyond offshore energy into wider marine infrastructure applications.\nMarket environment:\nTekmar's growth plans laid out in Project Aurora are underpinned by a prudent forecast of the growing aggregated demand between the three primary existing markets -\noffshore wind, oil & gas and port & harbour developments.\nThis conservative approach gives the business multiple routes to success in delivering growth in shareholder value.\nExcellence in Project Delivery:\nTekmar's leaner cost base and revised organisational structure is positioning the business to capture a sustainably higher volume of work, alongside increased focus and accountability for delivery. Having a larger and more diverse backlog is allowing the Group to utilize its existing available capacity and to deliver higher volumes without significant capital investment.\nCommenting on the contract award and the update on trading, Richard Turner, Chief Executive Officer of Tekmar Group, said:\n\"We are delighted to have been awarded the contract to support our long-standing relationship with a leading EPC customer through the award of another major UK offshore wind project. This contract reinforces Tekmar's position as the clear market leader in subsea asset protection, with our technologies protecting more than 50 GW of offshore wind capacity across over 120 projects worldwide.\nThis significant contract award helps to underline the momentum we have across our business. We exited FY25 with an improving financial performance and have started the new financial year with several significant contract wins resulting in a current order backlog of \u00a329m. This backlog and the commercial run rate places the Company on a much stronger footing than it was 12 months ago. We are driving greater volume with high-quality work and building a balanced order book across our core end markets. Our growing backlog supports significantly better utilisation and gives us an improved level of revenue visibility for the next 12 to 24 months. Importantly, we can deliver this backlog with our current resources, amplifying the benefits of our operational gearing.\nThe market environment supports growth across our technologies and services. Cable manufacturers, for example, are reporting strong financial performance with robust order books and this provides a very positive read-across for our growth and outlook. We are better organised to capture these opportunities with a disciplined approach to costs and cash management and an improving balance sheet. Overall, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making, and we look forward to making continued positive progress as we execute on our strategic plan.\"\n\u200b\nInvestor Presentation via Investor Meet Company\nRichard Turner, CEO, and Phil Lanigan, CFO, will host a live presentation via Investor Meet Company on\nThursday, 11 December 2025 at 10am GMT\n. The presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders. Questions can be submitted pre-event via your Investor Meet Company dashboard up until Wednesday, 10 December 2025 at 9am GMT, or at any time during the presentation.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add to meet Tekmar Group plc via:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/tekmar-group-plc/register\nInvestors who already follow Tekmar Group plc on the Investor Meet Company platform will automatically be invited.\nNote, the financial information relating to FY25 disclosed in this announcement remains subject to review and audit as part of Tekmar's year-end process for the 12 months to 30 September 2025.\nEnquiries:\nTekmar Group Plc\nRichard Turner, CEO\nPhil Lanigan, CFO\nc/o +44 (0)20 4582 3500\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nPeter Lynch\nNeil McDonald\nPearl Kellie\n+44 (0)131 220 9772\n+44 (0)131 220 9771\n+44 (0)131 220 9775\nGracechurch Group (Financial Media & Investor Relations)\nMurdo Montgomery\nAlexis Gore\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nAbout Tekmar Group plc\nTekmar Group plc collaborates with its partners to deliver robust and sustainable engineering led solutions that enable the world's energy transition.\nThrough our Offshore Energy and Marine Civils Divisions we provide a range of engineering services and technologies to support and protect offshore wind farms and other offshore energy assets and marine infrastructure.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is considered to be in the public domain.\nTekmar Group plc\n(\"Tekmar\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\n\u20ac8m Contract, Trading Update and Investor Meeting\nTekmar Group plc (AIM: TGP), a leading provider of asset protection technology and offshore energy services, is pleased to announce a significant contract award and an update on trading for FY25 and order book development. The Company will also host an investor presentation via Investor Meet Company on Thursday, 11 December 2025 at 10am GMT, with further details of this event provided below.\nSignificant \u20ac8m\nco\nntract award\nTekmar has been awarded a contract with an existing Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) customer for a major UK offshore wind farm. The project value is in excess of\n\u20ac8m\nand the scope of work includes the engineering and supply of Tekmar's 10th Generation Cable Protection System and associated cable ancillaries. The Group will deploy its in-house engineering expertise and holistic CPS design capabilities to deliver an optimised solution for the project's specific conditions. Delivery is scheduled for March 2027, with revenue recognition expected across the Group's FY26 and FY27 financial periods.\nUpdate on trading for FY25 - an improved second half performance\nThe Board expects to report revenue for the year-ended 30 September 2025 (\"FY25\") in the region of \u00a329m and above breakeven adjusted EBITDA. This is in-line with market expectations and reflects the anticipated profit weighting to the second half of FY25 (\"H2 25\"). A concerted effort was made through FY25 to develop a sustainably larger pipeline of work with a higher degree of both geographical and end market diversification. The benefit of this became increasingly apparent as the second half of FY25 progressed, with adjusted EBITDA for H2 25 showing a material improvement on the H1 25 adjusted EBITDA loss of \u00a30.7m.\nAs at 30 September 2025, net debt was \u00a32.8m.\nRecord order book and commercial momentum supports confident outlook\nSecuring higher volume and a balanced mix of work across Tekmar's end markets has been a primary objective for the business under the leadership of Richard Turner as CEO. The Board is very encouraged by the order book momentum the team is building and the progress being made.\nIncreasing order intake.\nSince 1 July 2025, Tekmar has secured new orders of c.\u00a329m. Order book as at the date of this release is 60 per cent higher than the equivalent period one year ago and a record order book for the Company since its admission to AIM in 2018. These orders will be delivered over the 2026 and 2027 financial years.\nSecuring high-quality work and a balanced portfolio.\nThe business is maintaining a disciplined commercial approach to projects and, as the volume of work grows, economies of scale give further opportunity for future margin development.\nA significant number of contract wins have been secured since the end of June 2025 that demonstrate the balanced growth Tekmar is achieving across its core energy markets including:\n-\nOffshore Wind -\nThe c.\n\u20ac8m\ncontract announced today builds on other milestone agreements announced in recent months. In October 2025, Tekmar announced a framework agreement with Jan De Nul, supporting TenneT's 2GW programme in Germany. This follows the framework agreement with Nexans, announced earlier in the year. These multi-year agreements reflect Tekmar's standing in the market and commitment to providing innovative, high-quality solutions that support the success of clients' complex projects.\n-\nOil & Gas -\nIn September 2025, Tekmar announced a US$10m contract award to provide cable protection technology for a major offshore energy project in the United Arab Emirates. This was followed by a \u20ac3.5m contract award in November 2025 with a leading global oilfield services provider in the Middle East. These contracts evidence Tekmar's successful focus on broadening its commercial activity in this very active region. Tekmar also delivered a \u00a32.0m contract in the Middle East announced in July 2025 to supply bespoke subsea infrastructure technology for a pipeline project. This also highlights the significant quick turnround work that is available to the Group.\n-\nPorts & Harbours -\nIn October 2025, Tekmar announced a $1.5m contract award for the provision of bespoke engineered scour protection and specialized deployment equipment for a new port development. The Board is anticipating further success in this growing market segment. Ports and Harbours is a significant growth",

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is considered to be in the public domain.\nTekmar Group plc\n(\"Tekmar\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nTrading Update\nTekmar Group plc (AIM: TGP), a leading provider of asset protection technology and offshore energy services globally, provides a trading update for the year ending 30 September 2025 (\"\nFY2025\n\")\n.\nCurrent Trading and FY2025 Outlook\nIn the interim results announced on 26 June 2025, Tekmar highlighted the increasing strength of its visible pipeline, with in excess of \u00a350m of\nprojects scheduled for award in the second half of the calendar year to December 2025. Subject to these anticipated awards being converted and the timing of these awards, the Board expected \"EBITDA generation to be improved in the second half such that a reasonable expectation is for adjusted EBITDA for FY2025 to be broadly consistent with FY2024.\"1\nThe bidding pipeline has remained strong in the second half of FY2025 and the fourth quarter, in particular, has been strong for new awards. However, the conversion to orders has been slower than anticipated with customers' procurement decisions taking longer than expected. These delays have had a corresponding impact\non the expected financial outturn for the second half of FY2025 with some forecasted revenue moving into FY2026. The Board continues to expect improved revenue and EBITDA generation in the second half of the year, albeit at a lower level than previously anticipated. Accordingly, the Board's expectation is that the Group will achieve an adjusted EBITDA\n2\nbreak-even position for the full year. This represents a material improvement in second half trading from the \u00a30.7m EBITDA loss for the first half of the year with higher margins being delivered.\nStrategic Progress\nUnder the leadership of Richard Turner as CEO, who joined in September 2024, the business has been aligned to deliver on Project Aurora - the Board's medium-term value creation strategy to deliver true scale and record financial performance for the Group. Successful execution of the plan will achieve a\nfundamental change in the scale and mix of revenue and deliver significant profitability gains driven by the benefit of operational gearing.\nDespite short term trading challenges, Tekmar continues to make good progress on the key initiatives within Project Aurora:\n\u200b\nIncrease order intake.\nThis has been a primary objective for FY2025, establishing the platform for sustained growth in FY2026 and beyond. The healthy current pipeline and order intake in Q42025 supports an anticipated strong starting backlog for FY2026, with these projects well balanced between sectors and geography. Tekmar has also strengthened and realigned its Sales organisation within 2025 in order to increase collaboration with customers, and providing them with efficient access to the full breadth of the Group's asset protection technology and offshore energy services. The focus remains on Tekmar outperforming an improving market with continued long-term growth forecast across all sectors.\nMaintain tight control over cash.\nFY2025 run-rate capex is expected to be less than \u00a30.5m. There has also been significant progress over the last 12 months in improving the Company's aged debt position, including the agreed payment plan for \u00a32.1m of China aged debt, with \u00a30.6m received in June 2025.\n\u200b\nLaunch new business verticals\n. Tekmar is now organised across two verticals - Asset Protection Technology and Offshore Energy Services. This creates a leaner cost base with greater level of operational efficiency.\nGrow offshore Energy Services division.\nThis vertical is achieving a materially higher sales run-rate in FY2025 than in FY2024, consistent with the mid-term objective to scale this division to 25% of Group revenue (from 6% in FY2024).\n\u200b\nResolve legacy warranty claims\n. Commercial settlement agreements have been announced this year with two customers.\nBoth with no admission of liability and no conclusion of defect with the Company's products and were\nfully covered by the insurance monies already received by Tekmar with nil cash impact for the Group.\nExecute M&A.\nThere is\nan active acquisition pipeline in place\nwith discussions ongoing with selected targets. The Board continues to adopt a disciplined approach to assessing acquisition opportunities to ensure value for shareholders.\nNet debt\n3\nas at 30 June 2025 was \u00a32.6m and the Group's existing loan facilities provide adequate cash resources to support the Group's working capital requirements and the repayment of the CBILs loan",

Tekmar has agreed settlement terms with the Customer with no admission of liability and no conclusion of defect with the Company's products.\nThe financial impact of the settlement is fully covered by insurance proceeds already received by Tekmar and will therefore have no cash impact. The agreement draws a line under all known defect claims with the Customer and does not affect Tekmar's ongoing commercial relationships with the Customer or, in Tekmar's view, the wider industry.\nWith matters fully concluded with this Customer, and the announcement by Tekmar on 20 March 2025 relating to a commercial settlement concluded with a different customer, commercial discussions remain ongoing regarding the resolution of the remaining notifications related to legacy matters as set out in the FY24 Annual Report.\nRichard Turner, CEO of Tekmar Group, commented:\n\"Resolving these legacy matters is an important step as we continue to move forward from historic industry-wide challenges. We are pleased to have reached this agreement, fully supported by insurance proceeds, and to maintain a strong and positive relationship with a leading offshore wind developer.

FY24 includes an impairment charge of \u00a31.5m, a provision of \u00a30.5m in respect of an aged debt balance and \u00a30.7m provision in respect of warranty claims. The prior year includes a \u00a34.7m impairment charge.\n\u00b7\nThe Group held \u00a34.6m of cash as at 30 September 2024 with net debt of \u00a31.6m. This cash position excludes the SCF Capital Partners \u00a318m convertible loan note facility which remains undrawn and is available to drive growth through acquisitions.\n\u00b7\nDuring the year, the Group completed the divestment of its subsidiary, Subsea Innovation Limited for a total cash consideration of \u00a31.9m. This divestment aligns with Tekmar's strategy to drive profitable growth and improve its financial performance. As at the year end, \u00a30.2m cash was received with \u00a31.7m being deferred.\n\u00b7\nOrder book as at the end of January 2025 of \u00a316.4m and net debt of \u00a30.4m.\nStrategic plan in place to achieve a step-change in scale and transformation\n\u00b7\nRefreshed three-year strategy in-place under new CEO, Richard Turner, who was appointed in September 2024. The plan focuses on achieving greater scale through accelerated profitable organic growth and complementary M&A.\n\u00b7\nRobust M&A pipeline developed and the Board is actively assessing M&A opportunities.\n\u00b7\nWarranty claims in relation to alleged CPS defects have progressed. The Group has recognised a net charge of \u00a30.7m in FY24 from a \u00a35.8m provision which is largely offset by insurance monies received post year end of \u00a35.2m.\nFinancial KPIs\nAudited 12M\nended\nSep-24\n\u00a3m\nAudited 12M\nended\nSep-23\n\u00a3m\nRestated\nAudited 12M\nended\nSep-22\n\u00a3m\nRestated\nRevenue1\n32.8\n35.6\n33.2\nAdjusted EBITDA2\n1.7\n0.6\n(2.3)\nGross profit %\n32%\n23%\n23%\nNet cash/(debt)3\n(1.6)\n(1.4)\n1.5\nCommercial KPIs\n12M\nended\nSep-24\n\u00a3m\n12M\nended\nSep-23\n\u00a3m\n12M\nended\nSep-22\n\u00a3m\nOrder Book4\n16.4\n16.7\n15.0\nOrder intake5\n32.4\n37.4\n33.2\nNotes:\n(1)\nRevenue is the value of sales recognised in the financial statements in the year.\n(2)\nAdjusted Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and significant one-off items, as defined in CFO review.\n(3)\nNet cash / (debt) represents total cash less banking facilities.\n(4)\nOrder Book is defined as signed and committed contracts with clients.\n(5)\nOrder intake is the value of contracts awarded in the in the year.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nThe Board is encouraged that the market environment is improving and supports sustained demand for Tekmar's technology and engineering services across our markets. Moreover, we believe Tekmar's differentiated technology positions the Group to outperform this improving market. This is supported by the Group's developing sales pipeline, which the Board expects will convert to orders and revenue over time.\nAccordingly, we believe a reasonable expectation is for EBITDA for FY25 to be consistent with FY24, and for the phasing of EBITDA generation to be second half weighted. This is aligned with our primary focus on increasing order intake through 2025 to position the Group for improved performance in 2026 and beyond.\nThe Company continues to maintain tight controls on managing the cash requirements of the business to support growth and working capital, including disciplined capex and targeted investment in products and services that represent the greatest opportunity for near-term growth.\nRichard Turner, CEO, commented:\n\"Overall, these results demonstrate we now have a stronger platform from which we can execute our medium-term plan to deliver true scale and diversification. FY24 was a transitionary year for Tekmar, where we focused on the basics - providing high-quality engineering, delivering on time and maintaining consistent commercial discipline. This supported the Group reporting its highest level of Adjusted EBITDA since FY20, and a material improvement in gross margin to 32%. Looking ahead, our markets are aligned for growth like never before. Our strategy looks to capitalise on our industry pedigree to drive organic growth across all revenue streams, leverage our operational gearing to enhance our returns on sales, drive value through strategic M&A and generate cash to build our reserves and fuel our growth.\"\nEnquiries:\nTekmar Group plc\nRichard Turner, CEO\nLeanne Wilkinson, ",

This represents the highest full-year Adjusted EBITDA reported by the Group since FY20.\n\u00b7\nThe expected increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily a result of significant improvement in gross profit margin, which is expected to be in excess of 30% for FY24 (FY23: 23%)(2).\n\u00b7\nThe Board has established a three-year plan to increase market share in an improving and growing market with a view to delivering record financial performance. Achieving greater scale is central to the plan through driving higher order intake across the Group's existing portfolio of products and services.\n\u00b7\nSuccessful execution of the organic growth plan achieves a fundamental change in the scale and quality of revenue and delivers significant profitability gains driven by the benefit of operational gearing.\n\u00b7\nThis step-change in profit performance, improved cash flows and stronger returns on capital is central to the Board's value creation strategy to deliver exceptional investment returns for shareholders.\n\u00b7\nThe value creation strategy is further supported by the Board's ambitious M&A strategy with an active acquisition pipeline in place.\n\u00b7\nThe focus for FY25 will be on order book development to position the Group for sustained revenue growth in FY26 and beyond.\nRichard Turner, CEO of Tekmar Group plc, said:\n\"Having worked across the oil and gas and offshore wind markets for more than 15 years, my enthusiasm for the opportunity we have ahead of us at Tekmar has only been strengthened by my initial weeks as CEO. We have differentiated technology that sets us apart in the market. Our holistic offering is a key enabler across the full lifecycle of offshore energy projects from front end engineering and design, installation, operation and decommissioning. We have delivered over 340,000 geotechnical engineering and analysis hours, supplied over 10,000 cable protection systems to over 40GW of offshore wind projects globally and lead the way in subsea stabilisation technology with more than 100,000 products in service. Our know-how and industry expertise are hard-earned and our technology is without equal in the industry.\nLike many others in our industry, our capability has not borne satisfactory results in recent years, evident by sub-scale order intake, earnings and weak cash flow. Market conditions have been challenging, in particular across the offshore wind sector as developers struggled to contend with systemic design issues, escalating material costs and higher interest rates - factors that were incompatible with historic low strike prices.\nDespite the obvious toll of this period on our business, we have used this time wisely, taking the opportunity to realign and refocus our teams, whilst working proactively with customers to understand their evolving needs. Through doing so we have developed next generation protection and assurance technology that will be crucial in ensuring security and certainty of supply from offshore assets forming the backbone of future energy supply.\nMany of the headwinds in offshore renewables and conventional energy markets are subsiding and there is a higher volume of projects now being sanctioned than ever before. We remain cautious on how this market recovery will translate to backlog in the short-term, but we believe that market demand is set to increase steadily into 2025 and beyond. This provides us with real enthusiasm about the role we can play in supporting energy transition whist maximising shareholder value.\n2024 has been a transitionary year for Tekmar, where we have focused on the basics - providing high-quality engineering, delivering on time and maintaining consistent commercial discipline. Looking forward, we now have a structured organic growth plan which aims to progressively build a business with true strength and resilience. Resilience afforded to us by larger",

The Board is very encouraged by the order book momentum the team is building and the progress being made. Increasing order intake. Since 1 July 2025, Tekmar has secured new orders of c.\u00a329m. Order book as at the date of this release is 60 per cent higher than the equivalent period one year ago and a record order book for the Company since its admission to AIM in 2018. These orders will be delivered over the 2026 and 2027 financial years. Securing high-quality work and a balanced portfolio. The business is maintaining a disciplined commercial approach to projects and, as the volume of work grows, economies of scale give further opportunity for future margin development.

          "content": "From Hybridan in an update last week FYI: \"Tekmar\u2019s Offshore Energy and Marine Civils Divisions supply a range of engineering services and technologies that support and protect offshore wind energy production. The Company announced a significant new contract on 10 September worth more than $10m. It is with an international Engineering Procurement & Construction (EPC) contractor for the design and manufacture of Tekmar's polyurethane cable protection system, TekDuct. The ultimate client is a major offshore energy project in the United Arab Emirates. Work on the contract will commence immediately, with final delivery scheduled for Q1 2026. The CEO reports there is a pipeline of good quality orders suggesting sustained growth for 2026 and beyond. At the Trading update for FY 30 September 2025, announced on 2 September, the Board continued to expect improved revenue to \u00a329.7m (taken from Alpha Terminal) and EBITDA albeit at a lower level than previously anticipated but still representing a material improvement. Net debt at the end of June 2025 was \u00a32.6m, and the Group's existing loan facilities should provide adequate working capital as well as the repayment of the CBILs loan which is due on 31 October 2025. In addition, the Group holds the former Subsea Innovation Limited freehold premises as an asset held for sale with a book value of \u00a32.8m. We calculate that the TekDuct order is around 26% of revenue forecast (taken from Alpha Terminal) of \u00a338.6m for 2026, giving a substantial lift in EBITDA to \u00a32.9m (taken from Alpha Terminal) from \u00a30.1m in 2025. Hybridan Comment: The $10m contract was a reminder of the large market opportunity, although the price rally attracted selling pressure, but the increasing EBITDA could attract new investors.\"",

          "content": "From Hybridan in an update last week FYI: \"Tekmar\u2019s Offshore Energy and Marine Civils Divisions supply a range of engineering services and technologies that support and protect offshore wind energy production. The Company announced a significant new contract on 10 September worth more than $10m. It is with an international Engineering Procurement & Construction (EPC) contractor for the design and manufacture of Tekmar's polyurethane cable protection system, TekDuct. The ultimate client is a major offshore energy project in the United Arab Emirates. Work on the contract will commence immediately, with final delivery scheduled for Q1 2026. The CEO reports there is a pipeline of good quality orders suggesting sustained growth for 2026 and beyond. At the Trading update for FY 30 September 2025, announced on 2 September, the Board continued to expect improved revenue to \u00a329.7m (taken from Alpha Terminal) and EBITDA albeit at a lower level than previously anticipated but still representing a material improvement. Net debt at the end of June 2025 was \u00a32.6m, and the Group's existing loan facilities should provide adequate working capital as well as the repayment of the CBILs loan which is due on 31 October 2025. In addition, the Group holds the former Subsea Innovation Limited freehold premises as an asset held for sale with a book value of \u00a32.8m. We calculate that the TekDuct order is around 26% of revenue forecast (taken from Alpha Terminal) of \u00a338.6m for 2026, giving a substantial lift in EBITDA to \u00a32.9m (taken from Alpha Terminal) from \u00a30.1m in 2025. Hybridan Comment: The $10m contract was a reminder of the large market opportunity, although the price rally attracted selling pressure, but the increasing EBITDA could attract new investors.\"",

The business is maintaining a disciplined commercial approach to projects and, as the volume of work grows, economies of scale give further opportunity for future margin development.

The Board is very encouraged by the order book momentum the team is building and the progress being made. Increasing order intake. Since 1 July 2025, Tekmar has secured new orders of c.\u00a329m. Order book as at the date of this release is 60 per cent higher than the equivalent period one year ago and a record order book for the Company since its admission to AIM in 2018.

The business is maintaining a disciplined commercial approach to projects and, as the volume of work grows, economies of scale give further opportunity for future margin development.

The Board is very encouraged by the order book momentum the team is building and the progress being made. Increasing order intake. Since 1 July 2025, Tekmar has secured new orders of c.\u00a329m. Order book as at the date of this release is 60 per cent higher than the equivalent period one year ago and a record order book for the Company since its admission to AIM in 2018. These orders will be delivered over the 2026 and 2027 financial years. Securing high-quality work and a balanced portfolio. The business is maintaining a disciplined commercial approach to projects and, as the volume of work grows, economies of scale give further opportunity for future margin development.

The Board is very encouraged by the order book momentum the team is building and the progress being made. Increasing order intake. Since 1 July 2025, Tekmar has secured new orders of c.\u00a329m.
