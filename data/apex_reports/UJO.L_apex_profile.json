          "content": "15 Dec 2025 12:15\nRNS Number : 5983L\nUnion Jack Oil PLC\n15 December 2025\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/201\nas it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"MAR\"), and is disclosed\nin accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\n15 December\n2025\nUnion Jack Oil\nplc\n(\"Union Jack\" or the\n\"Company\")\nBiscathorpe Planning Update - PEDL253\nUnion Jack Oil plc (AIM: UJO, OTCQB: UJOGF) a UK and USA focused onshore hydrocarbon production, development, exploration, and investment company advises that the joint venture partnership has made the decision to withdraw the planning appeal in relation to the refusal of planning consent for a side-track drilling operation and oilfield development at Biscathorpe, contained within PEDL253. The appeal was due to be heard at a public inquiry scheduled to take place in April 2026. Subsequently, the joint venture will fulfil its regulatory obligations and relinquish the licence in due course.\nUnion Jack holds a 45% non-operated interest in PEDL253.\nThe licence operator, Egdon Resources U.K. Limited (\"Egdon\"), had previously secured planning consent in December 2023 for the appraisal and production of hydrocarbon resources from its Biscathorpe wellsite. A subsequent legal challenge in the High Court (July 2024) based on the\nFinch\ndecision, quashed the 2023 planning consent. In September 2024, Egdon requested the Planning Inspectorate (\"PINS\") to redetermine the appeal by written representations. Egdon submitted an addendum to its environmental statement which documented an assessment of the expected downstream greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated from an oil development at Biscathorpe.\nAt the request of PINS, supplementary information was provided during 2025 that included an updated Statement of Case, an updated Statement of Common Ground, and a Climate Change Assessment. In October, PINS unexpectedly advised that a new Planning Inspector had been appointed and that he had concluded that the appeal should be conducted as a four-to-six-day inquiry, rather than by Egdon's preference for written representations.\nHaving considered the commercial aspects, prevailing tax regime and the continued lack of clear case law in respect of oil and gas projects in the UK post-\nFinch\n, the PEDL253 joint venture partnership has concluded that it could no longer justify its continued investment in the Biscathorpe project, and that it should therefore withdraw its appeal. This collective decision was augmented by a strengthened legislative duty applying to National Landscapes (formerly AONBs) introduced in late 2024.\nDavid Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack Oil, commented\n: \"With a backdrop of a changing macro-economic environment, along with the continued regulatory uncertainty in relation to how downstream emissions will be considered, we have concluded that this is the correct decision for the Company's wider objectives, which includes the future development of Wressle and the planned drilling programme in Oklahoma.\n\"A comprehensive review of all of Union Jack's projects in the UK and USA will be issued in January 2026.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nUnion Jack Oil plc\nDavid Bramhill\ninfo@unionjackoil.com\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nMatthew Johnson\nRichard Hail\nJen Clarke\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nZeus Capital Limited\nJoint Broker\nAntonio Bossi\nSimon Johnson\nGeorge Duxberry\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nHarbour Access\nUSA Investor Relations\nJonathan Paterson\n+1 (475) 477 9402\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Union Jack holds a 53% interest in Sark.\nSark was drilled to a Total Depth of 5,391 feet and the Prue interval was highlighted on electric logs as hydrocarbon bearing following evaluation.\nTemporary production facilities were installed and a 30-day test programme was undertaken. The production test of the Prue Sandstone failed to produce commercial hydrocarbons.\nPost well analysis indicates the Sark well encountered a valid structural closure, however, the trap was subsequently breached.\nDavid Bramhill, Executive Chairman of Union Jack, commented:\n\"Following the drilling of four successful discoveries in Oklahoma to date, this is an unexpected and disappointing result. Our US interests, with income from Moccasin, the Andrews Field and Mineral Royalties, continue to be profitable and we look forward to continuing our Oklahoma drilling programme.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nUnion Jack Oil plc\ninfo@unionjackoil.com\nDavid Bramhill\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nMatthew Johnson\nRichard Hail\nJen Clarke\nZeus\n+44 (0)20 3829 5000\nJoint Broker\nAntonio Bossi\nSimon Johnson\nGeorge Duxberry\nGneiss Energy Limited\n+ 44 (0)20 3983 9263\nFinancial Adviser\nJon Fitzpatrick\nPaul Weidman\nHarbour Access\n+1 (475) 477 9402\nUSA Investor Relations\nJonathan Paterson\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
