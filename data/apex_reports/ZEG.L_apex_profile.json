But we believe that the second half of the transformation will be just as exciting. And there are three reasons for this. The first is that once we have reduced the number of Zegona shares by 70%, our current market capitalization is below the multiples of our competitors. We are trading at around 9 times cash flow, when we should be trading at around 13 times. Therefore, we are currently undervalued. If we close the gap with our competitors, such as Telef\u00f3nica and Orange, our share price should be around \u00a325. The second reason is that we will be able to slightly increase revenue, and there is still room to further reduce costs in the business. The combination of both should allow us to generate even more cash flow. When we acquired the business, cash flow was \u20ac400 million. Last year, we reached \u20ac600 million. This fiscal year, which ends in March, we will be close to \u20ac800 million. And we aim to reach \u20ac1 billion in the coming years. And the third reason why investors will be interested in the second half of our transformation plan is RANco, a joint venture with another operator that provides wholesale mobile network services.\" hxxps://www.expansion.com/empresas/tecnologia/2026/01/26/6973ab17468aebd1418b4590.html",

The strong run to 750p was underpinned by the prospect of a larger stake sale and indeed it could have moved higher again on that news. A smaller stake sale could drive ZEG down to 570p or less. My own view is that Trump does brinkmanship and then pulls back to lurch onto the next project. So any uncertainty in investment terms will soon dissipate as it surely did in the recent rebound after the sell-off. This will make ZEG a compulsive buy in investing terms.",

          "content": "The Spanish publication, Expansion.com, has interviewed Zegona's CEO, Eamonn O'Hare, in which he says: \"In that period of time, 20 months, we have multiplied Zegona 's share price by almost 12. But we believe that the second half of the transformation will be just as exciting. And there are three reasons for this. The first is that once we have reduced the number of Zegona shares by 70%, our current market capitalization is below the multiples of our competitors. We are trading at around 9 times cash flow, when we should be trading at around 13 times. Therefore, we are currently undervalued. If we close the gap with our competitors, such as Telef\u00f3nica and Orange, our share price should be around \u00a325. The second reason is that we will be able to slightly increase revenue, and there is still room to further reduce costs in the business. The combination of both should allow us to generate even more cash flow. When we acquired the business, cash flow was \u20ac400 million. Last year, we reached \u20ac600 million. This fiscal year, which ends in March, we will be close to \u20ac800 million. And we aim to reach \u20ac1 billion in the coming years. And the third reason why investors will be interested in the second half of our transformation plan is RANco, a joint venture with another operator that provides wholesale mobile network services.\" hxxps://www.expansion.com/empresas/tecnologia/2026/01/26/6973ab17468aebd1418b4590.html",

The strong run to 750p was underpinned by the prospect of a larger stake sale and indeed it could have moved higher again on that news. A smaller stake sale could drive ZEG down to 570p or less. My own view is that Trump does brinkmanship and then pulls back to lurch onto the next project. So any uncertainty in investment terms will soon dissipate as it surely did in the recent rebound after the sell-off. This will make ZEG a compulsive buy in investing terms.",

          "content": "The Spanish publication, Expansion.com, has interviewed Zegona's CEO, Eamonn O'Hare, in which he says: \"In that period of time, 20 months, we have multiplied Zegona 's share price by almost 12. But we believe that the second half of the transformation will be just as exciting. And there are three reasons for this. The first is that once we have reduced the number of Zegona shares by 70%, our current market capitalization is below the multiples of our competitors. We are trading at around 9 times cash flow, when we should be trading at around 13 times. Therefore, we are currently undervalued. If we close the gap with our competitors, such as Telef\u00f3nica and Orange, our share price should be around \u00a325. The second reason is that we will be able to slightly increase revenue, and there is still room to further reduce costs in the business. The combination of both should allow us to generate even more cash flow. When we acquired the business, cash flow was \u20ac400 million. Last year, we reached \u20ac600 million. This fiscal year, which ends in March, we will be close to \u20ac800 million. And we aim to reach \u20ac1 billion in the coming years. And the third reason why investors will be interested in the second half of our transformation plan is RANco, a joint venture with another operator that provides wholesale mobile network services.\" hxxps://www.expansion.com/empresas/tecnologia/2026/01/26/6973ab17468aebd1418b4590.html",

The strong run to 750p was underpinned by the prospect of a larger stake sale and indeed it could have moved higher again on that news. A smaller stake sale could drive ZEG down to 570p or less. My own view is that Trump does brinkmanship and then pulls back to lurch onto the next project. So any uncertainty in investment terms will soon dissipate as it surely did in the recent rebound after the sell-off. This will make ZEG a compulsive buy in investing terms.",

But we believe that the second half of the transformation will be just as exciting. And there are three reasons for this. The first is that once we have reduced the number of Zegona shares by 70%, our current market capitalization is below the multiples of our competitors. We are trading at around 9 times cash flow, when we should be trading at around 13 times. Therefore, we are currently undervalued. If we close the gap with our competitors, such as Telef\u00f3nica and Orange, our share price should be around \u00a325. The second reason is that we will be able to slightly increase revenue, and there is still room to further reduce costs in the business. The combination of both should allow us to generate even more cash flow. When we acquired the business, cash flow was \u20ac400 million. Last year, we reached \u20ac600 million. This fiscal year, which ends in March, we will be close to \u20ac800 million. And we aim to reach \u20ac1 billion in the coming years. And the third reason why investors will be interested in the second half of our transformation plan is RANco, a joint venture with another operator that provides wholesale mobile network services.\" hxxps://www.expansion.com/empresas/tecnologia/2026/01/26/6973ab17468aebd1418b4590.html",

The strong run to 750p was underpinned by the prospect of a larger stake sale and indeed it could have moved higher again on that news. A smaller stake sale could drive ZEG down to 570p or less. My own view is that Trump does brinkmanship and then pulls back to lurch onto the next project. So any uncertainty in investment terms will soon dissipate as it surely did in the recent rebound after the sell-off. This will make ZEG a compulsive buy in investing terms.",

But we believe that the second half of the transformation will be just as exciting. And there are three reasons for this. The first is that once we have reduced the number of Zegona shares by 70%, our current market capitalization is below the multiples of our competitors. We are trading at around 9 times cash flow, when we should be trading at around 13 times. Therefore, we are currently undervalued. If we close the gap with our competitors, such as Telef\u00f3nica and Orange, our share price should be around \u00a325. The second reason is that we will be able to slightly increase revenue, and there is still room to further reduce costs in the business. The combination of both should allow us to generate even more cash flow. When we acquired the business, cash flow was \u20ac400 million. Last year, we reached \u20ac600 million. This fiscal year, which ends in March, we will be close to \u20ac800 million. And we aim to reach \u20ac1 billion in the coming years. And the third reason why investors will be interested in the second half of our transformation plan is RANco, a joint venture with another operator that provides wholesale mobile network services.\" hxxps://www.expansion.com/empresas/tecnologia/2026/01/26/6973ab17468aebd1418b4590.html",

The strong run to 750p was underpinned by the prospect of a larger stake sale and indeed it could have moved higher again on that news. A smaller stake sale could drive ZEG down to 570p or less. My own view is that Trump does brinkmanship and then pulls back to lurch onto the next project. So any uncertainty in investment terms will soon dissipate as it surely did in the recent rebound after the sell-off. This will make ZEG a compulsive buy in investing terms.",

          "content": "The Spanish publication, Expansion.com, has interviewed Zegona's CEO, Eamonn O'Hare, in which he says: \"In that period of time, 20 months, we have multiplied Zegona 's share price by almost 12. But we believe that the second half of the transformation will be just as exciting. And there are three reasons for this. The first is that once we have reduced the number of Zegona shares by 70%, our current market capitalization is below the multiples of our competitors. We are trading at around 9 times cash flow, when we should be trading at around 13 times. Therefore, we are currently undervalued. If we close the gap with our competitors, such as Telef\u00f3nica and Orange, our share price should be around \u00a325. The second reason is that we will be able to slightly increase revenue, and there is still room to further reduce costs in the business. The combination of both should allow us to generate even more cash flow. When we acquired the business, cash flow was \u20ac400 million. Last year, we reached \u20ac600 million. This fiscal year, which ends in March, we will be close to \u20ac800 million. And we aim to reach \u20ac1 billion in the coming years. And the third reason why investors will be interested in the second half of our transformation plan is RANco, a joint venture with another operator that provides wholesale mobile network services.\" hxxps://www.expansion.com/empresas/tecnologia/2026/01/26/6973ab17468aebd1418b4590.html",

The strong run to 750p was underpinned by the prospect of a larger stake sale and indeed it could have moved higher again on that news. A smaller stake sale could drive ZEG down to 570p or less. My own view is that Trump does brinkmanship and then pulls back to lurch onto the next project. So any uncertainty in investment terms will soon dissipate as it surely did in the recent rebound after the sell-off. This will make ZEG a compulsive buy in investing terms.",
