          "content": "23 Dec 2025 15:39\nRNS Number : 7149M\nIronveld PLC\n23 December 2025\n23 December 2025\nIronveld PLC\nOperational Update,\nDelay to the publication of FY25 Accounts\nand Temporary suspension\nIronveld PLC (\"Ironveld\" or the \"Company\"), the mining development company focused on producing high-value strategic metals, is pleased to provide an operational update on Ironveld's joint-venture DMS-grade magnetite processing facility in Limpopo, South Africa (the \"Plant\"). The Company also confirms that there has been a delay to the preparation of its audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 (\"FY25 Accounts\") and the FY25 Accounts will therefore not be published by 31 December 2025, the deadline under AIM Rule 19. Consequently, the Company's shares will be temporarily suspended from trading on AIM as of 7.30 a.m. on 2 January 2026, pending publication of the FY25 Accounts.\nOperational Update\nSecured Commercial Milestone: Initial Pre-Paid Trial Order\nThe Company has secured its first, client pre-paid, trial order for Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") grade magnetite for its joint venture. This initial commercial transaction, which involves pre-payment prior to collection, is a critical step in the product qualification process. Successful completion is intended to lead to a larger 12-month offtake contract with this client.\nAdvanced Offtake Discussions: Major Market Opportunity Progress\nIronveld is pleased to report that discussions with a blue-chip mining house for DMS grade magnetite have progressed substantially. The prospective partner has expressed a clear intention to procure a\u00a01,000-tonne trial order in the first quarter of 2026 (\"Q1\"). This trial is anticipated to serve as a precursor to a significant annual offtake agreement, with a potential scale in the region of\u00a0ZAR 180 million per annum. While not yet finalised, these advanced talks demonstrate the strong market demand and validation for the DMS grade magnetite material.\nExpanding Sales Pipeline & Product Diversification\nThe Company, working closely with Daemaneng Minerals (Pty) Ltd (\"Daemaneng\"), is engaged in discussions with a number of additional counterparties in relation to potential contracts for its DMS-grade magnetite and Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore. The ROM product represents a prospective new revenue stream, with initial revenues from Lapon Mining (Pty) Ltd (\"Lapon Mining\") expected to commence in early 2026. The continued expansion of the Company's sales pipeline reflects increasing market interest and supports the Company's strategy to diversify its revenue base. The opportunity to sell our ROM product has advanced to the final stages of negotiation for a trial order of approximately 25,000 tonnes, which is anticipated to be delivered in early 2026. Subject to the successful completion of this trial and agreement on final commercial terms, the parties intend to consider a longer-term, consistent offtake arrangement.\nStrategic Marketing Partnership to Drive Growth\nThe Company's operating partner, Daemaneng, is in the final stages of concluding a strategic marketing agreement with an established German trading house with a longstanding presence in Southern Africa. The proposed partnership is intended to leverage the trading house's extensive regional networks to accelerate commercial development, with a focus on securing new customers across South Africa, Botswana and other Southern African jurisdictions. Subject to finalisation, initial business contributions are anticipated to commence in Q1.\nThe partnership is expected to support an expansion of the planned DMS plant to accommodate increased throughput, with capacity envisaged to approximately double relative to the currently planned configuration.\nIn addition, access to Asian end-markets is expected to underpin increased demand for ROM product, including the potential for regular, vessel-sized shipments.\nOperational Readiness: Plant Optimisation on Track / Mining Operations\nConcurrently, Daemaneng continues to make steady progress on planned plant improvements and optimisation initiatives. These works are strategically focused on ensuring operational reliability and capacity and product quality align seamlessly with the anticipated demand growth through 2026 and beyond. Daemaneng has assumed full operational responsibility for the DMS plant operations as well as Mining Operations at Lapon Mining.\nDelay to Publication of FY25 Accounts\nDespite the best efforts of all parties, Ironveld requires further time for its auditors to complete certain procedures relating to the audit of the Company's FY25 Accounts, with the delay primarily related to completion of audit-related procedures in South Africa. The Directors have provided the information requested to the Company's advisers in South Africa and are working with its audit advisers to complete the audit process as soon as possible.\nThe Company anticipates that it will publish the FY25 Accounts during January 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored. A further announcement will be made in due course.\nNotwithstanding the temporary suspension of trading in the Company's shares, Ironveld will continue to make announcements as and when there are any developments that require to be notified under the AIM Rules\u00a0for Companies.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"This update demonstrates meaningful momentum across commercial, strategic, and operational fronts. The secured, pre-paid trial order is our first tangible market validation, and the advanced discussions for a landmark contract signal the scale of the opportunity before us. Daemaneng's new strategic marketing partnership provides a robust platform for growth. Ironveld remains focused on executing its strategy to become a significant supplier of high-quality magnetite products. We will update shareholders on further material developments.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"UK MAR\"), which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

Key commissioning and readiness activities have been completed, including confirming the Plant's power draw and procuring a new containerised Caterpillar generator, with the existing unit now designated as a backup. The new generator, along with diesel fuel, was effectively delivered to the Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") site yesterday.\nDaemaneng is also engaged in advanced and developing offtake discussions with several counterparties for the Plant's future production.\nThe planned schedule leading up to the formal operational handover to Daemaneng, in their capacity as sub-contractor of the Plant,\u00a0includes the following scheduled workstreams:\n\u00b7\nThe new generator will be connected to the Plant, followed by comprehensive mechanical and electrical inspections, including greasing, oil fill-ups and live testing of all equipment. Final manpower allocations for the operational phase will also be completed.\n\u00b7\nThe focus will then shift to critical process optimisations. This includes the delivery of a 30-tonne screen, one excavator, one front-end loader and other supporting equipment as production ramps up in the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nOn the DMS site, the replacement of essential pipework and adjustments to the crushers, mill trommel and magnetic separation units will take place. The Plant is then scheduled to begin processing stockpiled material through the circuit.\n\u00b7\nTo further support operational readiness,\nthree storage containers, which are equipped with a comprehensive suite of spare parts, maintenance equipment and tools\nwill also arrive on site.\n\u00b7\nThe establishment of prefabricated on-site office facilities and the finalisation of product shedding procedures will complete the preparatory phase scheduled for this week.\nThis structured approach ensures all safety and compliance protocols are addressed, with relevant Certificates of Compliance being reviewed and documentation for high-risk activities prepared and validated.\nStructured Community Engagement\nAlongside this structured approach to safety, Daemaneng has appointed its HR Manager, Mrs. Bongiwe Nkosi, as a dedicated community liaison. Under the direct oversight of Ironveld's Group Compliance Manager, Mr. Bernard Ntuli, Mrs. Nkosi will support initiatives related to local employment, supplier development and the procurement of services. Mr. Ntuli remains the official and sole point of contact for all formal communication. An introductory meeting was held yesterday with the Lekhureng community, which is in the closest proximity to our operations and was very well-received. Further meetings with other relevant communities are scheduled for the remainder of the week. Mr. Ntuli reports directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson.\nOperational Oversight and Control\nIronveld, as the appointed operator, retains full operational oversight and control of the DMS plant and mining operations. This is managed through Mr. Tebogo Phetla, who acts as Ironveld's senior on-site representative, providing direct oversight and serving as the primary liaison with the Daemaneng operational team. In this capacity, Mr. Phetla is responsible for monitoring all activities, collecting and compiling operational reports from Plant Manager, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, and reporting these directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson. Mr. Phetla's extensive project management experience and long-standing involvement with the project since its inception are key to this role.\nDMS Plant Expertise to Lead Operations and to Drive Plant Performance\nAs mentioned, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, from the Daemaneng team, will be the Plant Manager overseeing the DMS Plant operations. Mr. Mkhaliphi brings extensive and directly relevant experience to this critical role, including:\n\u00b7\nProven Leadership in DMS Operation: Recently led the full construction and commissioning of a large-scale 200 tonnes-per-hour DMS plant.\n\u00b7\nDemonstrated Record in Process Optimisation: Has a demonstrated history of improving DMS plant performance, including achieving a 12% reduction in magnetite losses at a coal DMS plant and increasing diamond recovery by 7% across multiple diamond DMS plants.\n\u00b7\nExtensive DMS Technical Knowledge: His background as a Senior Metallurgical Engineer involved designing and reviewing DMS plants, auditing DMS units and implementing process control models to enhance efficiency.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"We are very pleased with the commitment and progress demonstrated by the Daemaneng team. The project remains on schedule and in line with our previously communicated milestones, and it is particularly encouraging that Daemaneng will be running material through the Plant later this week. This marks a significant and tangible step forward in moving from preparation into early production.\n\"I am confident we can achieve our production targets, leveraging the dedicated work and support of the Ironveld team alongside Victor's hands-on DMS expertise in both commissioning and optimising DMS plants combined with the additional experience and leadership of the wider Daemaneng team, provides us with a significant advantage as we ramp up operations.\n\"Overall, this phase represents a clear demonstration of the partnership's capability to deliver results, and we are now well-positioned for continued operational progress. We look forward to providing further updates on key milestones as they are achieved.\"\nFigure 1\n- The Ironveld and Daemaneng leadership teams at the plant and mine site (on 6 November, 2025, from left to right\n): Bernard Ntuli (Ironveld Group Compliance Manager), Kris Andersson (Ironveld CEO), Glenn Norton (Daemaneng CEO), Victor Mkhaliphi (Daemaneng Plant Manager) and Tebogo Phetla (Ironveld Operations Manager).\nFigure 2 -\nCaterpillar\ngenerator offloaded at DMS site (on 10 November, 2025)\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope\n+44 20 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray\n+44 20 7138 3204\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

Revenues will be distributed according to a transparent profit-sharing waterfall between Altona, Sable and Daemaneng, with a guaranteed\u00a0base revenue per tonne\u00a0for Altona and Sable in equal parts.\nNo Capex or Opex for Ironveld, Sable or the Joint-Venture\nAll operating and capital costs are borne entirely by Daemaneng, allowing both Ironveld and Sable to benefit directly from production upside while fully de-risking the joint-venture and their respective balance sheets.\nAlignment of Interests and Operational Transparency\nThe arrangement operates on an open-book basis, ensuring full visibility of Plant performance and financial results, with Daemaneng's upside entirely linked to efficiency, optimisation, and market performance.\n\u00b7\nKey Obligations of\nDaemaneng include\n:\no\nFund all capital and operational expenditures (Capex and Opex).\no\nOptimise and expand Plant production to a minimum of 15,000 tonnes per month.\no\nAct as the exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced.\no\nAssume full responsibility for ore supply, quality, and logistics.\n\u00b7\nCommercial Model\n: The revenue distribution for each tonne of DMS-grade magnetite sold is as follows:\no\nThe base revenue per tonne is allocated for the benefit of Altona and Sable in a 50:50 ratio.\no\nDaemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the Actual Sales Price.\no\nAny remaining Additional Profit (Actual Sales Price minus Base Revenue and Commission) is shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng.\nThis arrangement is designed to ensure the Plant's rapid expansion and operational efficiency while securing a stable and attractive revenue stream for the joint venture.\nPrepayment Commitment:\nDaemaneng will provide an initial prepayment of ZAR 1.6 million, split equally between Altona and Sable, further demonstrating commitment to near-term cash-flow support.\nMobilisation and Operational Start Up\nDaemaneng is set to deploy its fleet and operational equipment to the DMS Plant and mine site by the end of next week. On-site teams will commence mobilisation and early commissioning immediately thereafter, leading to the full handover of management of operations by mid-November 2025.\nKris Andersson, Chief Executive Officer of Ironveld PLC, commented:\n\"This binding term sheet marks another significant milestone in Ironveld's ongoing transformation into a lean, agile, and revenue-generating business. It represents the next major step in establishing a fully integrated and self-sustaining operating model across our mining and processing activities. By once again partnering with Daemaneng Minerals, now also at the DMS Plant level, we are achieving true vertical integration from mine to magnetite concentrate, creating a capital-light structure that fully de-risks Ironveld's financial exposure while maintaining direct participation in future operational upside.\n\"This partnership is built on alignment and accountability. It brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of our assets and deliver tangible production growth to 15,000 tonnes per month.\n\"The dedication and sustained effort of our team over recent months has delivered the tangible progress we have all been working toward. At the end of the day, success is always a team effort, and this achievement reflects the collective hard work, determination, and commitment of everyone involved.\n\"I want to congratulate the entire team on the significant progress made in developing and advancing the DMS Plant, which has directly enabled the conclusion of this highly attractive technical and commercial agreement\n\"We look forward to updating the market more frequently as the results of these agreements begin to bear fruit and the real potential of our operations unfolds.\"\nGlenn Norton, Chief Executive Officer of Daemaneng Minerals (Pty) Ltd, added:\n\"We are very pleased to strengthen our partnership with Ironveld through this binding term sheet, which formalises Daemaneng's role as the exclusive manager of operations at the JV DMS Plant. Our immediate focus will be on optimisation, operational excellence, and achieving a rapid production ramp-up leading to sustained growth.\n\"Daemaneng is fully committed to funding, managing, and optimising the Plant's operations to realise its full commercial potential and ensure production reaches and maintains 15,000 tonnes per month on a consistent basis.\n\"I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to Kris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld PLC, and Ulrich Bester, CEO of Sable Platinum Holdings, for their trust and confidence in Daemaneng.\n\"We have already established a strong and collaborative working relationship with Ironveld, which we view as long-term and founded on trust, mutual respect, and shared values. We also see significant potential for future collaboration and additional commercial opportunities with Ironveld across diversified areas, as our organisations continue to align operationally and strategically.\"\nOutlook\nThe execution of this binding term sheet builds directly on the\u00a0Mining Operations Agreement\u00a0signed earlier in October 2025, collectively forming a unified framework across Ironveld's upstream and downstream operations.\nWith mining, logistics, marketing and processing now under Daemaneng's operational leadership, the Company anticipates an accelerated ramp-up of production and cash-flow generation across the value chain.\nDaemaneng's optimisation programme includes enhancements to crushing efficiency, water recovery systems, and throughput reliability.\nFull-scale production of 15,000 tonnes per month is targeted for March / April 2026 according to Daemaneng's projections.\nTimeline and Implementation\nDaemaneng has confirmed that it will mobilise its fleet and operational equipment to the DMS Plant and to the mine site by the end of next week, with personnel deployment and initial commissioning activities commencing immediately thereafter. The parties expect the handover of on-site management and operational control to be completed by mid-November 2025.\nProduction ramp-up targets, as agreed under the Binding Term Sheet, are as follows:\nMonth\nTarget Production (Tonnes)\nStatus\nDecember 2025\n4,000\nRamp-up\nJanuary 2026\n6,000\nRamp-up\nFebruary 2026\n7,500\nRamp-up\nMarch 2026\n10 - 15,000\nFull Production\nApril 2026 onwards\n15,000\nSustained Production\nFurther announcements will be made as key milestones are achieved, and production volumes progressively increase through Q4 2025 and into 2026.\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope\n+44 20 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray\n+44 20 7138 3204\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
