          "content": "3 Feb 2026 17:34\nRNS Number : 5917R\nIronveld PLC\n03 February 2026\n3 February 2026\nIronveld PLC\nUpdate on Operations & Publication of FY25 Accounts\nIronveld PLC (\"Ironveld\" or the \"Company\"), the mining development company focused on producing high-value strategic metals, provides the following update regarding the Company's audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 (\"FY25 Accounts\").\nThe audit of the FY25 Accounts is now substantially complete and the Company's UK auditor will shortly be commencing its review procedures. Consequently, the Board of Ironveld now expects the FY25 Accounts to be published by the end of February 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored.\nNotwithstanding the ongoing suspension of trading in the Company's shares, Ironveld will continue to make announcements as and when there are any developments that require to be notified under the AIM Rules\u00a0for Companies.\nOperational Update\nThe widely reported regional flooding in Limpopo, South Africa has temporarily impacted site access and operational activities at the Lapon Mine and the Company's Dense Media Separation (DMS) processing plant, which is held through a joint venture (\"JV\") with\nSable Platinum Holdings (Pty) Ltd and\nmanaged by contractor Daemaneng. Daemaneng is preparing to mobilise resources to commence dewatering of the pit and will perform the necessary repairs to restore full site accessibility. Subject to weather conditions, which are forecast to improve, operations are expected to return to normal within one month.\nTo mitigate the risk of extreme weather events on the Company's future operations, the design process for comprehensive water management infrastructure has been completed, and it is expected that this infrastructure will be operational during Q2, 2026.\nDMS Off-take\nOn 23 December 2025, the Company confirmed that it was in advanced discussions with a client regarding an offtake agreement for DMS grade magnetite. These discussions remain active and are progressing positively, with the intention being to formalise an agreement for an initial 1,000-tonne (\"t\") trial of DMS magnetite. Due to the operational impact of regional flooding, it has been agreed with the client that the trial will now be scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2026. The potential for this trial to lead to a substantial annual offtake agreement, as previously indicated, remains unchanged.\nIn addition, the Company's contractor, Daemaneng, has successfully completed a second fully paid trial delivery of DMS-grade magnetite to an established South African client, who has indicated a potential off-take capacity of 5,000 tonnes per month (\"tpm\").\nRun-of-Mine Off-take\n\u200b\nThe Company is pleased to confirm that Daemaneng has now concluded key commercial terms for a significant off-take agreement with a South African client for an initial 25,000t trial of Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore from the Lapon Mine, supported by an agreed ZAR 3 million (approx. GBP138,000) prepayment. The agreement is expected to be formally executed imminently, with the potential to evolve into a 12-month contract.\nDaemaneng Strategic Partnership\nIronveld's operating partner, Daemaneng, continues to be in advanced and exclusive discussions regarding a strategic marketing agreement with an established German trading house with a longstanding presence in Southern Africa.\nThe prospective off-take partner has expressed a clear intent to secure the entirety of Lapon's ROM output. The envisaged arrangement would follow a phased implementation plan, with off-take volumes scaling progressively to a target of up to 300,000tpm. Furthermore, the group has proposed financial and strategic support to facilitate the operational scale-up to achieve these targeted volumes.\nConcurrently, the group has expressed significant commercial interest in the Company's DMS-grade magnetite product, with an indicated demand profile that substantially exceeds the current planned production capacity of the DMS plant.\nCommercial Pipeline\nThe Company, together with Daemaneng, is encouraged by the levels of inbound enquiries and maintains active negotiations regarding potential off-take agreements for its DMS-grade magnetite and ROM products with other potential clients.\nIt should be noted that the Company's and Daemaneng's commercial negotiations on certain DMS and ROM products remain subject to further negotiation and no binding terms have been agreed. While the progress and level of interest are highly encouraging, there can be no certainty that final agreements will be reached.\nFurther updates will be provided in due course.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"While the immediate logistical and operational impact of the recent flooding is acknowledged, our strategic outlook for the business is overwhelmingly positive. Our focus is firmly on capturing the significant opportunities we see across our product portfolio.\n\"The advanced discussions for our entire projected ROM output highlight a commercial opportunity greater than initially anticipated. The proposed long-term off-take framework envisions a\u00a0gradual, multi-phased ramp-up\u00a0to a target volume of 300,000 tonnes per month,\u00a0which would be achieved over time.\u00a0The specific proposal to provide both strategic and financial backing to Daemaneng for the operational scale-up demonstrates a high degree of commitment and validates the strategic value of the magnetite ore from Lapon.\n\"Alongside this, the sustained interest in the DMS grade magnetite, which exceeds our JV's projected maximum plant capacity, highlights the strong market demand as well as providing clear commercial validation for our assets.\n\"Our priority is now to advance these parallel discussions to formal agreements. We look forward to updating shareholders on the progress being made to commercialise both our ROM and DMS product streams, which together form a compelling and diversified growth strategy for Ironveld.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"UK MAR\"), which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The Company also confirms that there has been a delay to the preparation of its audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 (\"FY25 Accounts\") and the FY25 Accounts will therefore not be published by 31 December 2025, the deadline under AIM Rule 19. Consequently, the Company's shares will be temporarily suspended from trading on AIM as of 7.30 a.m. on 2 January 2026, pending publication of the FY25 Accounts.\nOperational Update\nSecured Commercial Milestone: Initial Pre-Paid Trial Order\nThe Company has secured its first, client pre-paid, trial order for Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") grade magnetite for its joint venture. This initial commercial transaction, which involves pre-payment prior to collection, is a critical step in the product qualification process. Successful completion is intended to lead to a larger 12-month offtake contract with this client.\nAdvanced Offtake Discussions: Major Market Opportunity Progress\nIronveld is pleased to report that discussions with a blue-chip mining house for DMS grade magnetite have progressed substantially. The prospective partner has expressed a clear intention to procure a\u00a01,000-tonne trial order in the first quarter of 2026 (\"Q1\"). This trial is anticipated to serve as a precursor to a significant annual offtake agreement, with a potential scale in the region of\u00a0ZAR 180 million per annum. While not yet finalised, these advanced talks demonstrate the strong market demand and validation for the DMS grade magnetite material.\nExpanding Sales Pipeline & Product Diversification\nThe Company, working closely with Daemaneng Minerals (Pty) Ltd (\"Daemaneng\"), is engaged in discussions with a number of additional counterparties in relation to potential contracts for its DMS-grade magnetite and Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore. The ROM product represents a prospective new revenue stream, with initial revenues from Lapon Mining (Pty) Ltd (\"Lapon Mining\") expected to commence in early 2026. The continued expansion of the Company's sales pipeline reflects increasing market interest and supports the Company's strategy to diversify its revenue base. The opportunity to sell our ROM product has advanced to the final stages of negotiation for a trial order of approximately 25,000 tonnes, which is anticipated to be delivered in early 2026. Subject to the successful completion of this trial and agreement on final commercial terms, the parties intend to consider a longer-term, consistent offtake arrangement.\nStrategic Marketing Partnership to Drive Growth\nThe Company's operating partner, Daemaneng, is in the final stages of concluding a strategic marketing agreement with an established German trading house with a longstanding presence in Southern Africa. The proposed partnership is intended to leverage the trading house's extensive regional networks to accelerate commercial development, with a focus on securing new customers across South Africa, Botswana and other Southern African jurisdictions. Subject to finalisation, initial business contributions are anticipated to commence in Q1.\nThe partnership is expected to support an expansion of the planned DMS plant to accommodate increased throughput, with capacity envisaged to approximately double relative to the currently planned configuration.\nIn addition, access to Asian end-markets is expected to underpin increased demand for ROM product, including the potential for regular, vessel-sized shipments.\nOperational Readiness: Plant Optimisation on Track / Mining Operations\nConcurrently, Daemaneng continues to make steady progress on planned plant improvements and optimisation initiatives. These works are strategically focused on ensuring operational reliability and capacity and product quality align seamlessly with the anticipated demand growth through 2026 and beyond. Daemaneng has assumed full operational responsibility for the DMS plant operations as well as Mining Operations at Lapon Mining.\nDelay to Publication of FY25 Accounts\nDespite the best efforts of all parties, Ironveld requires further time for its auditors to complete certain procedures relating to the audit of the Company's FY25 Accounts, with the delay primarily related to completion of audit-related procedures in South Africa. The Directors have provided the information requested to the Company's advisers in South Africa and are working with its audit advisers to complete the audit process as soon as possible.\nThe Company anticipates that it will publish the FY25 Accounts during January 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored. A further announcement will be made in due course.\nNotwithstanding the temporary suspension of trading in the Company's shares, Ironveld will continue to make announcements as and when there are any developments that require to be notified under the AIM Rules\u00a0for Companies.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"This update demonstrates meaningful momentum across commercial, strategic, and operational fronts. The secured, pre-paid trial order is our first tangible market validation, and the advanced discussions for a landmark contract signal the scale of the opportunity before us. Daemaneng's new strategic marketing partnership provides a robust platform for growth. Ironveld remains focused on executing its strategy to become a significant supplier of high-quality magnetite products.

Key commissioning and readiness activities have been completed, including confirming the Plant's power draw and procuring a new containerised Caterpillar generator, with the existing unit now designated as a backup. The new generator, along with diesel fuel, was effectively delivered to the Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") site yesterday.\nDaemaneng is also engaged in advanced and developing offtake discussions with several counterparties for the Plant's future production.\nThe planned schedule leading up to the formal operational handover to Daemaneng, in their capacity as sub-contractor of the Plant,\u00a0includes the following scheduled workstreams:\n\u00b7\nThe new generator will be connected to the Plant, followed by comprehensive mechanical and electrical inspections, including greasing, oil fill-ups and live testing of all equipment. Final manpower allocations for the operational phase will also be completed.\n\u00b7\nThe focus will then shift to critical process optimisations. This includes the delivery of a 30-tonne screen, one excavator, one front-end loader and other supporting equipment as production ramps up in the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nOn the DMS site, the replacement of essential pipework and adjustments to the crushers, mill trommel and magnetic separation units will take place. The Plant is then scheduled to begin processing stockpiled material through the circuit.\n\u00b7\nTo further support operational readiness,\nthree storage containers, which are equipped with a comprehensive suite of spare parts, maintenance equipment and tools\nwill also arrive on site.\n\u00b7\nThe establishment of prefabricated on-site office facilities and the finalisation of product shedding procedures will complete the preparatory phase scheduled for this week.\nThis structured approach ensures all safety and compliance protocols are addressed, with relevant Certificates of Compliance being reviewed and documentation for high-risk activities prepared and validated.\nStructured Community Engagement\nAlongside this structured approach to safety, Daemaneng has appointed its HR Manager, Mrs. Bongiwe Nkosi, as a dedicated community liaison. Under the direct oversight of Ironveld's Group Compliance Manager, Mr. Bernard Ntuli, Mrs. Nkosi will support initiatives related to local employment, supplier development and the procurement of services. Mr. Ntuli remains the official and sole point of contact for all formal communication. An introductory meeting was held yesterday with the Lekhureng community, which is in the closest proximity to our operations and was very well-received. Further meetings with other relevant communities are scheduled for the remainder of the week. Mr. Ntuli reports directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson.\nOperational Oversight and Control\nIronveld, as the appointed operator, retains full operational oversight and control of the DMS plant and mining operations. This is managed through Mr. Tebogo Phetla, who acts as Ironveld's senior on-site representative, providing direct oversight and serving as the primary liaison with the Daemaneng operational team. In this capacity, Mr. Phetla is responsible for monitoring all activities, collecting and compiling operational reports from Plant Manager, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, and reporting these directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson. Mr. Phetla's extensive project management experience and long-standing involvement with the project since its inception are key to this role.\nDMS Plant Expertise to Lead Operations and to Drive Plant Performance\nAs mentioned, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, from the Daemaneng team, will be the Plant Manager overseeing the DMS Plant operations. Mr. Mkhaliphi brings extensive and directly relevant experience to this critical role, including:\n\u00b7\nProven Leadership in DMS Operation: Recently led the full construction and commissioning of a large-scale 200 tonnes-per-hour DMS plant.\n\u00b7\nDemonstrated Record in Process Optimisation: Has a demonstrated history of improving DMS plant performance, including achieving a 12% reduction in magnetite losses at a coal DMS plant and increasing diamond recovery by 7% across multiple diamond DMS plants.\n\u00b7\nExtensive DMS Technical Knowledge: His background as a Senior Metallurgical Engineer involved designing and reviewing DMS plants, auditing DMS units and implementing process control models to enhance efficiency.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"We are very pleased with the commitment and progress demonstrated by the Daemaneng team. The project remains on schedule and in line with our previously communicated milestones, and it is particularly encouraging that Daemaneng will be running material through the Plant later this week. This marks a significant and tangible step forward in moving from preparation into early production.\n\"I am confident we can achieve our production targets, leveraging the dedicated work and support of the Ironveld team alongside Victor's hands-on DMS expertise in both commissioning and optimising DMS plants combined with the additional experience and leadership of the wider Daemaneng team, provides us with a significant advantage as we ramp up operations.\n\"Overall, this phase represents a clear demonstration of the partnership's capability to deliver results, and we are now well-positioned for continued operational progress. We look forward to providing further updates on key milestones as they are achieved.\"\nFigure 1\n- The Ironveld and Daemaneng leadership teams at the plant and mine site (on 6 November, 2025, from left to right\n): Bernard Ntuli (Ironveld Group Compliance Manager), Kris Andersson (Ironveld CEO), Glenn Norton (Daemaneng CEO), Victor Mkhaliphi (Daemaneng Plant Manager) and Tebogo Phetla (Ironveld Operations Manager).\nFigure 2 -\nCaterpillar\ngenerator offloaded at DMS site (on 10 November, 2025)\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope\n+44 20 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray\n+44 20 7138 3204\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company also confirms that there has been a delay to the preparation of its audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 (\"FY25 Accounts\") and the FY25 Accounts will therefore not be published by 31 December 2025, the deadline under AIM Rule 19. Consequently, the Company's shares will be temporarily suspended from trading on AIM as of 7.30 a.m. on 2 January 2026, pending publication of the FY25 Accounts.\nOperational Update\nSecured Commercial Milestone: Initial Pre-Paid Trial Order\nThe Company has secured its first, client pre-paid, trial order for Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") grade magnetite for its joint venture. This initial commercial transaction, which involves pre-payment prior to collection, is a critical step in the product qualification process. Successful completion is intended to lead to a larger 12-month offtake contract with this client.\nAdvanced Offtake Discussions: Major Market Opportunity Progress\nIronveld is pleased to report that discussions with a blue-chip mining house for DMS grade magnetite have progressed substantially. The prospective partner has expressed a clear intention to procure a\u00a01,000-tonne trial order in the first quarter of 2026 (\"Q1\"). This trial is anticipated to serve as a precursor to a significant annual offtake agreement, with a potential scale in the region of\u00a0ZAR 180 million per annum. While not yet finalised, these advanced talks demonstrate the strong market demand and validation for the DMS grade magnetite material.\nExpanding Sales Pipeline & Product Diversification\nThe Company, working closely with Daemaneng Minerals (Pty) Ltd (\"Daemaneng\"), is engaged in discussions with a number of additional counterparties in relation to potential contracts for its DMS-grade magnetite and Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore. The ROM product represents a prospective new revenue stream, with initial revenues from Lapon Mining (Pty) Ltd (\"Lapon Mining\") expected to commence in early 2026. The continued expansion of the Company's sales pipeline reflects increasing market interest and supports the Company's strategy to diversify its revenue base. The opportunity to sell our ROM product has advanced to the final stages of negotiation for a trial order of approximately 25,000 tonnes, which is anticipated to be delivered in early 2026. Subject to the successful completion of this trial and agreement on final commercial terms, the parties intend to consider a longer-term, consistent offtake arrangement.\nStrategic Marketing Partnership to Drive Growth\nThe Company's operating partner, Daemaneng, is in the final stages of concluding a strategic marketing agreement with an established German trading house with a longstanding presence in Southern Africa. The proposed partnership is intended to leverage the trading house's extensive regional networks to accelerate commercial development, with a focus on securing new customers across South Africa, Botswana and other Southern African jurisdictions. Subject to finalisation, initial business contributions are anticipated to commence in Q1.\nThe partnership is expected to support an expansion of the planned DMS plant to accommodate increased throughput, with capacity envisaged to approximately double relative to the currently planned configuration.\nIn addition, access to Asian end-markets is expected to underpin increased demand for ROM product, including the potential for regular, vessel-sized shipments.\nOperational Readiness: Plant Optimisation on Track / Mining Operations\nConcurrently, Daemaneng continues to make steady progress on planned plant improvements and optimisation initiatives. These works are strategically focused on ensuring operational reliability and capacity and product quality align seamlessly with the anticipated demand growth through 2026 and beyond. Daemaneng has assumed full operational responsibility for the DMS plant operations as well as Mining Operations at Lapon Mining.\nDelay to Publication of FY25 Accounts\nDespite the best efforts of all parties, Ironveld requires further time for its auditors to complete certain procedures relating to the audit of the Company's FY25 Accounts, with the delay primarily related to completion of audit-related procedures in South Africa. The Directors have provided the information requested to the Company's advisers in South Africa and are working with its audit advisers to complete the audit process as soon as possible.\nThe Company anticipates that it will publish the FY25 Accounts during January 2026, following which trading ",

Key commissioning and readiness activities have been completed, including confirming the Plant's power draw and procuring a new containerised Caterpillar generator, with the existing unit now designated as a backup. The new generator, along with diesel fuel, was effectively delivered to the Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") site yesterday.\nDaemaneng is also engaged in advanced and developing offtake discussions with several counterparties for the Plant's future production.\nThe planned schedule leading up to the formal operational handover to Daemaneng, in their capacity as sub-contractor of the Plant,\u00a0includes the following scheduled workstreams:\n\u00b7\nThe new generator will be connected to the Plant, followed by comprehensive mechanical and electrical inspections, including greasing, oil fill-ups and live testing of all equipment. Final manpower allocations for the operational phase will also be completed.\n\u00b7\nThe focus will then shift to critical process optimisations. This includes the delivery of a 30-tonne screen, one excavator, one front-end loader and other supporting equipment as production ramps up in the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nOn the DMS site, the replacement of essential pipework and adjustments to the crushers, mill trommel and magnetic separation units will take place. The Plant is then scheduled to begin processing stockpiled material through the circuit.\n\u00b7\nTo further support operational readiness,\nthree storage containers, which are equipped with a comprehensive suite of spare parts, maintenance equipment and tools\nwill also arrive on site.\n\u00b7\nThe establishment of prefabricated on-site office facilities and the finalisation of product shedding procedures will complete the preparatory phase scheduled for this week.\nThis structured approach ensures all safety and compliance protocols are addressed, with relevant Certificates of Compliance being reviewed and documentation for high-risk activities prepared and validated.\nStructured Community Engagement\nAlongside this structured approach to safety, Daemaneng has appointed its HR Manager, Mrs. Bongiwe Nkosi, as a dedicated community liaison. Under the direct oversight of Ironveld's Group Compliance Manager, Mr. Bernard Ntuli, Mrs. Nkosi will support initiatives related to local employment, supplier development and the procurement of services. Mr. Ntuli remains the official and sole point of contact for all formal communication. An introductory meeting was held yesterday with the Lekhureng community, which is in the closest proximity to our operations and was very well-received. Further meetings with other relevant communities are scheduled for the remainder of the week. Mr. Ntuli reports directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson.\nOperational Oversight and Control\nIronveld, as the appointed operator, retains full operational oversight and control of the DMS plant and mining operations. This is managed through Mr. Tebogo Phetla, who acts as Ironveld's senior on-site representative, providing direct oversight and serving as the primary liaison with the Daemaneng operational team. In this capacity, Mr. Phetla is responsible for monitoring all activities, collecting and compiling operational reports from Plant Manager, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, and reporting these directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson. Mr. Phetla's extensive project management experience and long-standing involvement with the project since its inception are key to this role.\nDMS Plant Expertise to Lead Operations and to Drive Plant Performance\nAs mentioned, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, from the Daemaneng team, will be the Plant Manager overseeing the DMS Plant operations. Mr. Mkhaliphi brings extensive and directly relevant experience to this critical role, including:\n\u00b7\nProven Leadership in DMS Operation: Recently led the full construction and commissioning of a large-scale 200 tonnes-per-hour DMS plant.\n\u00b7\nDemonstrated Record in Process Optimisation: Has a demonstrated history of improving DMS plant performance, including achieving a 12% reduction in magnetite losses at a coal DMS plant and increasing diamond recovery by 7% across multiple diamond DMS plants.\n\u00b7\nExtensive DMS Technical Knowledge: His background as a Senior Metallurgical Engineer involved designing and reviewing DMS plants, auditing DMS ",

Revenues will be distributed according to a transparent profit-sharing waterfall between Altona, Sable and Daemaneng, with a guaranteed\u00a0base revenue per tonne\u00a0for Altona and Sable in equal parts.\nNo Capex or Opex for Ironveld, Sable or the Joint-Venture\nAll operating and capital costs are borne entirely by Daemaneng, allowing both Ironveld and Sable to benefit directly from production upside while fully de-risking the joint-venture and their respective balance sheets.\nAlignment of Interests and Operational Transparency\nThe arrangement operates on an open-book basis, ensuring full visibility of Plant performance and financial results, with Daemaneng's upside entirely linked to efficiency, optimisation, and market performance.\n\u00b7\nKey Obligations of\nDaemaneng include\n:\no\nFund all capital and operational expenditures (Capex and Opex).\no\nOptimise and expand Plant production to a minimum of 15,000 tonnes per month.\no\nAct as the exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced.\no\nAssume full responsibility for ore supply, quality, and logistics.\n\u00b7\nCommercial Model\n: The revenue distribution for each tonne of DMS-grade magnetite sold is as follows:\no\nThe base revenue per tonne is allocated for the benefit of Altona and Sable in a 50:50 ratio.\no\nDaemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the Actual Sales Price.\no\nAny remaining Additional Profit (Actual Sales Price minus Base Revenue and Commission) is shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng.\nThis arrangement is designed to ensure the Plant's rapid expansion and operational efficiency while securing a stable and attractive revenue stream for the joint venture.\nPrepayment Commitment:\nDaemaneng will provide an initial prepayment of ZAR 1.6 million, split equally between Altona and Sable, further demonstrating commitment to near-term cash-flow support.\nMobilisation and Operational Start Up\nDaemaneng is set to deploy its fleet and operational equipment to the DMS Plant and mine site by the end of next week. On-site teams will commence mobilisation and early commissioning immediately thereafter, leading to the full handover of management of operations by mid-Nov",

The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n7 October 2025\nIronveld PLC\n(\"Ironveld\" or the \"Company\")\nIronveld PLC Signs Mining Operations Agreement\nAgreement provides for a GBP 21.6 million capital and operational expenditure commitment, removing Ironveld's mining cost exposure and establishing new ROM-related revenue streams\n.\nIronveld PLC (AIM: IRON) is pleased to announce that its 74%-owned subsidiary, Lapon Mining (Pty) Ltd (\"Lapon Mining\"), has entered into a binding Mining Operations Agreement with Daemaneng Minerals (Pty) Ltd (\"Daemaneng\" or the \"Contractor\") through which Daemaneng will assume full responsibility for all mining operations, including all capital and operational expenditure, at the Lapon site over a five year period.\nUnder the Agreement, Daemaneng will assume full responsibility for all mining operations at the Lapon site - including all capital investment, operating costs, logistics, labour, compliance, and the establishment of on-site processing infrastructure - thereby eliminating any future mining-related expenditure for Lapon Mining.\nThe arrangement effectively transfers operating and funding obligations to Daemaneng, de-risking Ironveld's cost base while allowing Ironveld to retain its full ownership and control of the mining licence and governance oversight.\nBased on currently anticipated production levels, Daemaneng is expected to fund approximately ZAR 500 million (GBP21.6 million) of capital and operational costs at Lapon and will recover verified expenditure from the proceeds from realised sales of mined material, ensuring that returns are aligned with production performance.\nNo equity participation or ownership interest in Lapon Mining or any other Ironveld entity will accrue to Daemaneng under the Agreement.\nKey Highlights\n\u00b7\nIronveld to Incur No Operating or Capital Expenditure:\nThe Agreement transfers all mining-related operating and capital expenditure to Daemaneng, enabling Ironveld to maintain full exposure to production upside while eliminating direct cost risk and enhancing capital efficiency.\n\u00b7\nThree-Year Term and Five-Year Exclusivity:\nThe Agreement provides for an initial three-year operational term, with Daemaneng expected to fund approximately ZAR 500 million (equivalent to GBP 21.6 million) in total capital and operational expenditure over the five-year period. This investment commitment is based on Daemaneng's projected average monthly mining cost of approximately ZAR 8.3 million and is recoverable solely through realised sales of mined material.\nThe Contractor has been granted exclusive operating rights for five years, conditional upon maintaining full compliance with all agreed investment, production, and performance obligations. All ore supply and marketing activities will be conducted on a transparent, open-book basis, ensuring complete accountability, governance oversight, and alignment of interests between the parties.\n\u00b7\nGuaranteed Ore Supply to the JV DMS Plant:\nDaemaneng is contractually obligated to supply all ore required by Ironveld's JV DMS plant, irrespective of volume or demand levels with no upper limit on supply volumes. The Operator must meet all ore requirements necessary to sustain continuous production, ensuring a fully reliable and scalable supply chain to support Ironveld's downstream processing operations and future production growth.\n\u00b7\nNew and Additional Revenue Stream:\nThe partnership establishes an additional and strategically valuable income channel through the commercialisation of Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") material, complementing Ironveld's DMS-grade magnetite production. Under the terms of the Agreement, Daemaneng is contractually obligated to secure and manage all offtake agreements for the ROM material, ensuring continuous market access and sustainable revenue generation from the Lapon operations.\n\u00b7\nCommencement of Operations and Proven Track Record:\nMining operations under Daemaneng will commence shortly, with Daemaneng now fully responsible for achieving all production volumes and quality standards in line with market requirements, contractual obligations, and agreed performance parameters. Having successfully mined material from Lapon in 2018, Daemaneng brings proven operational familiarity with the deposit and its infrastructure, positioning the project for immediate mobilisation, efficient execution, and scalable growth.\nCommenting on the Agreement, Kris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld PLC, said:\n\"This agreement marks ",

Approximately 1.5 tons of heavy ANFO (emulsion) explosives were used to establish the initial production bench and create a free face for the continuation of mining activities.This initial waste blast is expected to have exposed approximately 3,000 tons of unweathered magnetite ore, which will be subsequently blasted and transported to the JV DMS processing plant for conversion into dense media separation (DMS) grade magnetite.Over the coming week, the overlying Gabro Norite waste rock will be removed to the designated waste stockpile, enabling blasting of the exposed magnetite ore into the pit and the commencement of consistent ore delivery to the DMS JV plant, located just 2 kilometres from the Lapon mine site.Lapon Mining is targeting production ramp-up to 20,000 tons of unweathered magnetite ore per month. This will be achieved by extending the current bench to 100 metres and establishing a second contiguous 100-metre bench, both of which have already had topsoil and free-dig overburden removed and are ready for the next phase of drilling and blasting.Ironveld CEO, Kris Andersson, commented:\n\"We are very pleased to have completed our first blast successfully, and safely. This represents a major step forward in developing a consistent and scalable ore supply from the Lapon Mining operation. I commend the entire mining team for their professionalism and efficient execution of this milestone. With mining now underway and ore sales to the DMS plant set to commence, we are well positioned to ramp up production and meet growing demand. These developments reflect the success of our strategic investment and development initiatives, which are now delivering tangible, value-accretive results. I am extremely proud of the dedication and teamwork demonstrated across both our mining and processing operations. We are operating with strong positive momentum, and I am confident in our ability to continue delivering and capitalising on the significant opportunities ahead.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee / Adam Rae\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope\n+44 20 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray\n+44 20 7138 3204\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

(SEAM) has been concluded; final legal documentation is in progress and expected to be finalised in the next few weeks. Further details were notified by the Company on 6 March 2025.\n\u00b7\nOfftake agreements for the DMS grade magnetite product are at an advanced stage, and we have potential to sell significant quantities into Mozambique, as well as locally in South Africa, where we are currently in the bidding process for a tender as previously communicated on\nFebruary 12, 2025.\nMining Operations\n\u00b7\nOverburden clearance of the first mining bench has been completed.\n\u00b7\nThe drilling plan has been developed and finalised, and drilling for the first blast is scheduled to be completed imminently by a third-party contractor.\n\u00b7\nThe first blast of fresh ore is scheduled to take place immediately following the completion of drilling, utilising the same contractor engaged for the drilling operations.\n\u00b7\nDiscussions with potential offtake partners for ore sales are progressing positively, with strong interest from multiple parties targeting export markets.\nSmelting Development\n\u00b7\nAn initial engineering study for a small-scale, water-based atomiser plant to produce high-purity iron powder has been completed.\n\u00b7\nA comprehensive design data pack including engineering drawings, proposed procurement strategies, and a list of recommended suppliers for the pilot water-atomised high-purity iron powder plant is currently being reviewed\u00a0by Ironveld's team and its consultants.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"I am very pleased with the progress being made on the ground. We are now entering a pivotal phase as we transition into revenue generation, with\nsales of our DMS-grade magnetite, under the existing offtake agreement with Sable Platinum Pty Ltd., expected to commence shortly.\nEncouragingly, demand for our material has exceeded expectations, with new enquiries and requests for product coming in on a consistent basis.\n\"The emerging opportunity to sell ore directly adds an exciting dimension to our revenue streams and further reinforces the international demand for vanadium, titanium, and iron. This is particularly promising for our future smelting operations, which are expected to deliver high-margin products and play a central role in unlocking the full value of our asset base.\n\"Over the coming months, we anticipate a fundamental shift in Ironveld's trajectory, from a development-stage company to a fully operational, revenue-generating business with positive cash flow. It is an exceptionally exciting time for the Company, and the team and I remain fully committed to executing our strategy and delivering long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nFurther updates will be provided in due course as the Company continues to make progress across all aspects of its operations.\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee / Adam Rae\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope\n+44 20 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray\n+44 20 7138 3204\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

While the year under review was relatively quiet operationally, I am pleased to report significant progress made during and post-period in securing funding and advancing key strategic initiatives.\nDuring the Period, several important changes to our leadership were implemented to support our evolving strategy. In October 2023, I assumed the role of Executive Chairman, succeeding Giles Clarke, who transitioned to a Non-Executive Director role. Giles's experience and commitment over the years have been invaluable to Ironveld, and I was grateful for his continued support during this transition. In May 2024, we were delighted to welcome Kristoffer Andersson as Chief Executive Officer. Kris's experience in mining, renewable energy, and commodities, along with his international experience, brings a fresh perspective to the Company as we advance our strategic goals. Post period, in November 2024, Giles retired from the Board. His leadership and insight have played a pivotal role in shaping Ironveld, and we extend our sincere thanks for his contribution. Following this change, I transitioned to the role of Non-Executive Chairman to ensure continuity as we embark on the next stage of growth.\nFinancial stability has been a key focus throughout the year. During the Period, we raised vital funds through a combination of equity placements and working capital facilities, including a premium fundraising of \u00a31.0 million in October 2023 and additional working capital facilities of \u00a3375,000 in February 2024 and \u00a3125,000 in April 2024. These measures were essential in supporting the Company's operational requirements and ensuring stability while we progressed discussions on broader funding initiatives.\nHowever, the most transformative development came post-period, with the successful completion of a \u00a32.5 million fundraising and proposed capital reorganisation in October 2024. This funding will enable the Company to complete the DMS plant in Limpopo and also make essential upgrades to our smelter complex, allowing us to achieve profitable production capacity and advance towards revenue generation and cash flow positivity by the end of Q2 2025. As part of our short-term goals, we aim to produce market samples of water-atomised high-purity iron powders at our smelter facility in Rustenburg, supported by the construction of a pilot plant to validate product quality and market acceptance. Production trials have already demonstrated operational capability, and securing offtake agreements for these products is expected to facilitate further funding opportunities to scale up operations. A third-party consultant with extensive experience in water-based atomisation has made significant progress on the design phase of a pilot plant for producing market samples and has completed an initial layout. Final design specifications and cost estimates are expected by the end of April 2025. The agreement for the acquisition of Ferrochrome Furnaces (Pty) Limited (\"FCF\") remains in place under unchanged terms. The Board continues to regard the transaction as a highly attractive opportunity, taking into account, among other factors, the favourable terms agreed, the significant tax losses available within FCF, and the strong potential to successfully produ",

Production trials have already demonstrated operational capability, and securing offtake agreements for these products is expected to facilitate further funding opportunities to scale up operations.\n\"Thank you for your continued support and we\nlook forward to sharing further positive updates with you in the near future.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nJohn Wardle, Chairman\nc/o BlytheRay\n020 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee / Adam Rae\nTurner Pope (Joint Broker)\nAndy Thacker/James Pope\n0131 220 6939\n020 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nMegan Ray/Tim Blythe\n020 7138 3204\nNotes to Editors:\nIronveld (IRON.LN) is the owner of Mining Rights over approximately 28 kilometres of outcropping Bushveld magnetite with a SAMREC compliant ore resource of some 56 million tons of ore grading 1,12% V2O5, 68,6% Fe2O3 and 14,7% TiO2.\nIn 2022 Ironveld agreed to acquire and refurbish a smelter facility in Rustenburg, South Africa, in which it can process its magnetite ore into the marketable products of high purity iron, titanium slag and vanadium slag. This transaction became unconditional in March 2023.\nIronveld is an AIM traded company. For further information on Ironveld please refer to\nwww.ironveld.com\n.\nChairman's Statement:\nIronveld completed a successful fund raise at the end of October 2024. This allowed the continued execution of the Company's business plan which is primarily to complete the DMS Magnetite plant and bring it into profitable production. At the smelter, the plan is to construct a demonstration scale water-based atomiser to produce market samples of the Company's high purity atomised powders in order to secure offtakes and funding for the development of the smelter project. Detailed design and costing studies for the initial plant are currently underway.\nThe DMS plant has made strong progress and remains on track to commence first commercial production in April 2025. With\nrobust operational plans and growing market demand, I am confident that Ironveld's strategic positioning will enable the Company to generate sustainable growth through the production of DMS Magnetite, iron powders, vanadium slag, and titanium slag. With considerable growth potential within the Project, as well as opportunities to further increase DMS Magnetite production, followed by a transition to higher-value products, I am excited about what the future holds for the Company.\nFinancial\nThe Group recorded a loss before tax of \u00a3689,000 (H1 2023: loss of \u00a3385,000) in the Period. The Company does not plan to pay a dividend for the six months ended 31 December 2024.\nPost Period End Events\nThe Company was able to renegotiate the DMS JV agreement with Sable Platinum Holdings (Pty) Ltd s",

(\"SEAM\") regarding the Company's joint venture at the Lapon magnetite plant in Limpopo Province, South Africa (the \"Plant\").\nFollowing successful renegotiations, Ironveld has revived the agreement with SEAM and has committed to funding the completion of the beneficiation plant, from the funds raised from the capital raise completed in November 2024. Commissioning of the Plant is expected to take place within the coming weeks, with the Plant set to process, produce, market, and sell DMS-grade magnetite.\nFollowing completion of the Plant, the joint venture will be structured as a 50/50 partnership between Altona Processing (Pty) Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ironveld Holdings, and SEAM's wholly owned subsidiary, Lapon Plant (Pty) Ltd. As part of the renegotiated agreement, SEAM has also committed to a prepayment of R5,000,000 for DMS grade magnetite material.\nThe revised joint venture agreement remains subject to signing of the final contract and therefore the terms expected to be agreed remain subject to change.\nIronveld is pleased to report that, despite heavy rainfall in Limpopo Province, construction of the DMS plant remains on track. Commissioning of the Plant and first magnetite production is expected in March 2025, with the first commercial production scheduled for April 2025. Management anticipates that the Plant will reach full operational capacity by the end of April 2025.\nIronveld Mining is actively clearing the mine site following the heavy rains and preparing to deliver ore for the DMS plant's commissioning. Community engagements continue, and the company has made its first contribution towards the academic requirements of the Social Labour Program.\nIronveld Smelting has made significant progress on the design of the water-based atomizer for producing market samples, with consultants having completed an initial layout. The final design and cost estimates are expected by the end of April.\nAccounts Update\nThe Company continues to work towards publication of its\u00a0annual accounts, which is now expected to occur by the end of March 2025, at which point trading of shares is expected to resume.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"The renegotiated agreement with SEAM significantly enhances Ironveld's position, increasing our equity stake in the DMS project from 25% to 50%. We are excited to collaborate with SEAM on this strategic partnership and look forward to advancing the project together.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee / Adam Rae\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope\n+44 20 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray\n+44 20 7138 3204\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Following initial sample production, the plant will ramp up to\u00a024-hour operations, targeting an initial output of 5,000 tonnes (\"t\") per month. Capacity will increase to\u00a015,000t per month\u00a0after installation and commissioning of a second, larger ball mill in March/April 2025.\nIronveld's mining team has now been mobilised to site, where stockpiles of pre-mined ore will be used for commissioning and initial production work, following which mining of fresh ore for continuing production will be undertaken.\nOfftake Agreements\n\u00b7\nA\u00a0firm initial offtake agreement\u00a0has been secured for\u00a0500t per month, with demand from this end user estimated at\u00a0around 1,000t per month.\n\u00b7\nA\u00a0tender bid is currently being prepared for an additional\u00a05,000t - 7,500t per month, with strong confidence in securing this contract due to the significantly lower logistical costs versus competitors, enabled by the close proximity of Ironveld's plant to the buyer.\n\u00b7\nOther strong expressions of interest are currently being reviewed from both DMS traders and end users.\nSmelter Activities\nTechnical work is underway relating to the detailed design of the Water Atomised Powder pilot plant at the Rustenburg smelter. This work is being performed by a third party with extensive experience of the process, including producing water atomised iron and platinum powders. It is expected that the design work will be completed on schedule in March 2025.\nAccounts Update\nOn 2 January 2025, following a delay to the publication of the Company's audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2024 (\"FY24 Accounts\"), the Company's shares were temporarily suspended from trading on AIM in accordance with AIM Rule 19. Since this time the Company and its advisers have advanced the workstreams required to complete the audit process, although these remain in progress. The Company is working to publish the FY24 Accounts as soon as possible, following which trading in Ironveld's shares is expected to resume.\nFurther updates will be provided as required.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented\n: \"\nI am very pleased with the progress that we have made on all operational fronts. The successful completion of the DMS plant is expected soon and will begin to generate cash flow for the Company shortly thereafter. The plant is designed to initially produce 5,000 tonnes per month of finished product, but with future improvements that we have planned, we will be able to triple production to 15,000 tonnes. We are also making good progress on the Water Atomised Powder designs, which will offer exciting further upsides\n.\nWe are making good progress towards the completion of our report and accounts. Our structure in South Africa involves 7 subsidiary companies, which optimises the administration of our wide-ranging operations, from mining through mineral processing to smelting and sale of final products. Our engagement of new auditors, refreshing our local audit team after 12 years, has been good and, whilst it has taken longer than we had anticipated, we anticipate being in a position to publish our accounts soon. In the meantime, I would like to thank shareholders for their patience and support.\nI look forward to keeping the market updated on what is an exciting period for the Company.\n\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee / Adam Rae\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope",

A circular containing further details on the proposed transaction and Capital Reorganisation (\"Circular\") and notice of meeting to convene the General Meeting, which is to be held at the offices of Cavendish, One Bartholomew Close, London EC1A 7BL at 10.00 a.m. on 20 November 2024, will be sent to Shareholders today. Following its publication, the Circular will be available on the Company's website at www.ironveld.com.\nThe fundraise will provide the capital required for Ironveld to advance its key strategic initiatives and unlock the significant value inherent in its assets. The Board believes that the current market capitalisation does not accurately reflect the true potential of the Company's assets, and the new funds will enable the Company to continue driving forward on several fronts, including:\n\u00b7\nCompletion of essential upgrades at the smelter complex to achieve profitable production capacity.\n\u00b7\nProgression towards revenue generation and cash flow positivity, anticipated by end of Q2 2025.\n\u00b7\nEstablishing Ironveld as the first producer of high-purity water-atomised iron in the Southern Hemisphere, opening new market opportunities.\n\u00b7\nCapitalising on our significant untapped asset value, which remains under appreciated in the current market valuation.\nIronveld has secured long-term, renewable Mining Licenses extending to 2045 and 2047, with a range of potential revenue streams from HPI, vanadium, and titanium products. In addition, the Company is also actively exploring new opportunities to diversify its asset portfolio, ensuring long-term growth and value creation.\nThe Company will maintain its focus on operational improvements and the production of high-quality coarse and water-atomised HPI powders. These efforts are designed to generate revenue, achieve profitability, and ultimately deliver long-term growth and increased shareholder value.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, said:\n\"We are incredibly grateful for the strong support from both our new and existing investors. This fundraise provides us with the capital needed to advance our strategic initiatives and address key operational objectives.\n\"These funds will allow us to complete the necessary smelter upgrades and work to address the disparity between our assets' inherent value and their reflection in the Company's market cap. We are confident this will position us for accelerated growth, value realisation, and enhanced shareholder returns.\n\"I would like to sincerely thank our shareholders for their continued belief in the Company's vision and for standing by us during this critical phase.\"\nFurther details of the proposed transaction and Capital Reorganisation have been extracted from the Circular and are set out below.\nDefined terms in this announcement are set out at the end of ",

The Facility Agreement enables the Company to draw down up to \u00a3125,000 on equivalent terms to the existing loan facilities with Tracarta (see announcement released on 2 February 2024) and has a term of six months.\nThe funds drawn down under the Facility Agreement will be used to strengthen the Company's working capital position.

As indicated in the Company's interim results announcement (released on 28 March 2024), the Board is assessing the Company's current funding requirements which will likely require the Company to raise additional capital, potentially through the issue of new equity.\nThe Facility Agreement has the following key terms:\nFacility Amount:\n\u00a3125,000\nTerm:\n6 months\nInterest:\n11% per annum\nFee:\n2.5%\nRepayment and Conversion:\nRepayment of any funds drawn down plus interest immediately upon receipt of funds drawn down from any replacement institutional debt facility or conversion at the issue price in the event of any future equity placing during the loan term\nWarrants:\nNone\nRelated Party Transaction\nJohn Wardle has a beneficial interest in Tracarta and, as such, the provision of the facility by Tracarta constitutes a related party transaction pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies.

That facility is currently fully drawn.\n\u00b7\nReceipt of a non-binding term sheet from a South African based financial institution regarding the asset level financing of mining and smelting activities, including the transition to production. The transaction is subject to further due diligence\n\u00b7\nMartin Eales stepped down from the Board, with Executive Chairman, Dr. John Wardle, taking over his CEO duties on an interim basis\n\u00b7\nIronveld is assessing current funding requirements until a transaction can be completed\n\u00b7\nThe Company currently has cash of circa \u00a325,000 (as of 27 March 2024)\nJohn Wardle, Executive Chairman, said:\n\"The Period saw Ironveld undergo significant changes at Board and Management level. These changes were necessary to continue to develop the Group operations towards unlocking the significant value in our assets. The receipt of a Term Sheet from a South African based financial institution in order to support the financing of mining and smelting activities at the Project is an important step in that direction. However the confirmation, quantum and timing of that potential funding is not yet certain.\n\"Thank you for your continued support and we look forward to sharing more positive news flow.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nJohn Wardle, Executive Chairman\nc/o BlytheRay\n020 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee / Adam Rae\nTurner Pope (Joint Broker)\nAndy Thacker/James Pope\n020 7220 0500\n020 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nMegan Ray/Tim Blythe\n020 7138 3204\nNotes to Editors:\nIronveld (IRON.LN) is the owner of Mining Rights over approximately 28 kilometres of outcropping Bushveld magnetite with a SAMREC compliant ore resource of some 56 million tons of ore grading 1,12% V2O5, 68,6% Fe2O3 and 14,7% TiO2.\nIn 2022 Ironveld agreed to acquire and refurbish a smelter facility in Rustenburg, South Africa, in which it can process its magnetite ore into the marketable products of high purity iron, titanium slag and vanadium slag. This transaction became unconditional in March 2023.\nIronveld is an AIM traded company. For further information on Ironveld please refer to\nwww.ironveld.com\n.\nChairman's Statement:\nI took over as Chairman from Giles Clarke towards the end of the Period, and as one of my first points of action, I was tasked with undertaking a full Group wide review of everything Ironveld related, including strategy, overhead costs and priorities. Some months later, and having completed this comprehensive review, I see many areas for improvement within the Company which must be resolved before sustainable, profitable production can be achieved.\nThe Period was one of necessary change, given the failures in delivery we have experienced over the last year or more. However, it also saw the Company begin to show the initial signs of positive things to come, as it took its first steps from developer to producer. This was best demonstrated in late June when the Company announced first sales of metal products from the Rustenburg s",

The market is wanting to see no raise in the meantime down here. Seeing as cash will start hitting Ironveld's accounts very soon plus should be cash over from June placing and the ~$0.5m upfront prepayment received already from Daemaneng i'm encouraged to think no placing will be forthcoming and once that's clear to the market and the positive newsflow rolls in we'll see a rerate... and then let the 0.072p warrants add to the cash pile rather than any extra subscription.",

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma. Valuations have resurged of late, and almost brought the country back in line with\u00a0other emergents...",

Speaking at the inaugural Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg this week, he promised to adopt a new fiscal anchor. This won\u2019t be straightforward. The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

Daemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the actual sales price, with any remaining profit (i.e., actual sales price less base revenue and commission) being shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng. This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive. And at the moment there is no sign of a fund raise and I would be surprised if there was. Anything positive to say for a change?",

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts.

The new RNS' were complementary in that the first transferred mining obligations to Daemaneng (up to \u00a321.6m worth) so as to supply all the ore for the DMS processing facility + add in another revenue stream in ROM. The second RNS gives Daemaneng charge of the DMS facility too, including mining logistics, marketing and processing. Essentially Ironveld are now a capital lite, royalty owner that isn't burdened with the risk that comes with such upstream and downstream activities but is subject to meaningful percentages of the profit. Also it's happening straight away, no delays. Daemaneng already on-site in Lapon with production and first ore deliveries to DMS plant expected any day (30 days from 7th Oct but can't say if we'll get updated immediately) and similarly commissioning will already be happening at the DMS plant with full handover of operations in the coming weeks. I consider it the two rns' combined as a major derisking that will be reflected in the  share price as the activity at mine site picks up and is reported to the market over the coming weeks and months.",

My belief is that mining should be starting either this week or early next week, subject to weather as it is the rainy season and the equipment is heavy stuff! The. Hoping for steady progress through to 2026 when things should really ramp up and be at full production early Q2. If our sums are right this should produce healthy returns and a strong re rating of the shares. Iron have stated that they expect to give more regular updates once things are in action and proven to be happening (nice change from the old regime!) so I would hope to hear a progress update within the next two weeks. Starting to come together and looking really exciting from where I sit. Views??",

Teams are totally aligned, and if there are any issues they will tackle them together and with speed. Within weeks we should have a good throughput and by Q2 I expect full production (if not before). By my sums we will soon be on a P/E of 2.5, which means every two and a half years we could buy back the whole company at the current SP (LT I know your figures are a lot better than mine!). So money will flow when people wake up and smell the magnetite. Also a share capitalisation should be on the cards once we are producing. Looking good IMHO and of course DYO research",

It shows they have pushed at least around \u00a31m into the market. The break even is .036 so they are still selling at a profit at these levels, although hopefully it will start to dry up soon! The idea of a capitalisation is a good one although probably when the SP is on a stronger footing with known figures etc. Anyone got any more info?",

However, you are right, I am hoping most sellers have done so and a few holders are left at TPI, although each day more sales seem to appear. We would need to get the daily share registers to see the movement and I am not bothered to do so as I know what is happening and hope I k ow what will happen!! GLA",

          "content": "With a little help from my friend AI. Ironveld PLC has made significant progress in de-risking and operationalising its Lapon mining site and associated Dense Media Separation (DMS) magnetite processing plant through partnerships with Daemaneng Minerals. The collaboration shifts capital and operational burdens to Daemaneng while preserving Ironveld's ownership, licence control, and revenue upside. Below is a contextual summary of the two prior updates in October and today's RNS (Nov 11, 2025), highlighting the progression toward integrated, low-cost production October 7th - Binding Mining Operations Agreement (Lapon Site). Key Details - Ironveld's 74%-owned subsidiary, Lapon Mining signed a five-year agreement with Daemaneng, making Daemaneng fully responsible for all mining activities at the Lapon site. This includes funding ~ZAR 500 million (approx. \u00a321.6 million) in capital and operational expenditure (e.g., equipment, logistics, labor, compliance, and on-site infrastructure). Daemaneng recovers costs from sales of run-of-mine (ROM) material, with no equity stake in Lapon Mining. Ironveld's Benefits: Eliminates Ironveld's direct mining costs and risks; guarantees ore supply to the DMS plant; introduces new revenue from ROM sales (managed by Daemaneng). Production ramp-up targeted within 30 days, with initial ROM offtake sales to generate near-term cash flow.  This \"defining moment\" (per CEO Kris Andersson) revives stalled operations at Lapon (previously mined in 2018) and aligns with Ironveld's capital-light strategy. October 30th - Binding Term Sheet for DMS Plant Operations. Key Details - Building on the mining agreement, Ironveld's subsidiary Altona  (operator of the JV DMS plant with Sable Exploration) signed a term sheet appointing Daemaneng as exclusive sub-contractor for plant management. Daemaneng handles all operations, logistics, and sales of DMS-grade magnetite, with revenues shared via a profit waterfall (guaranteed base per tonne for Altona/Sable). No capex/opex for Ironveld or partners. Ironveld's Benefits - Fully integrates mining-to-processing chain under Daemaneng's oversight; Daemaneng acts as sales agent, ensuring market access without Ironveld's financial exposure. Targets rapid mobilization leveraging Daemaneng's site familiarity. Complements the October 7 deal to create a \"performance-driven, capital-light\" model, positioning Ironveld for scalable growth and profitability without upfront costs. Today's news - Operational Progress Update. Key Details - follows the October agreements, confirming on-schedule preparations for DMS plant restart. Highlights include - Delivery of a new Caterpillar generator to the site on November 10, 2025, for power reliability. Phased handover, processing of stockpiled material to begin \"later this week\"; full inspections, pipework/crusher optimizations, and additional equipment (e.g., screens, excavators) deliveries imminent. /1",

CEO Andersson noted the \"commitment and progress\" of Daemaneng, aligning with prior timelines for rapid ramp-up.

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma. Valuations have resurged of late, and almost brought the country back in line with\u00a0other emergents...",

Speaking at the inaugural Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg this week, he promised to adopt a new fiscal anchor. This won\u2019t be straightforward. The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

Daemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the actual sales price, with any remaining profit (i.e., actual sales price less base revenue and commission) being shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng. This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive. And at the moment there is no sign of a fund raise and I would be surprised if there was. Anything positive to say for a change?",

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January. With a large shareholding I am really excited at the opportunity they now have and the last RNS showed how serious they are in really getting this going",

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive.

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January. With a large shareholding I am really excited at the opportunity they now have and the last RNS showed how serious they are in really getting this going",

And whilst a few \u00a3100k is nothing in the grand scheme of things I still think it would be a negative to accept dilution at .5p when there's been so much progress since the .45p raise. So I am hoping that (i) there's no need for cash but if there is (ii) they are able to defer certain payments until further derisking updates can be released to market allowing for decent share price appreciation first. Ps looking forward to some snippets from the TP note - have they given a broker target in the past?",

Will they be exercised and sold into the market at 1p and above? Sure but it won't be in holders benefit to tank the market so should be able to see appreciation consistently if operations keep delivering warrants or not.... There's 200m broker warrants from last raise and ~10B from the previous raise so there will be an eventual 26B total share count if all those warrants are eventually exercised and it will bring in around \u00a38m cash. 0.25p would be a 5X return from here and still only be a filly diluted mcap of \u00a352m, miniscule compared to the potential profits here. There's some workings from the weekend where LT  comes up with a ~\u00a3150m camp, that would be 0.75p even with every single warrant exercised which is 15X today's share price. And that's assuming little to no upside from HPI/smelter back in action.",

The new RNS' were complementary in that the first transferred mining obligations to Daemaneng (up to \u00a321.6m worth) so as to supply all the ore for the DMS processing facility + add in another revenue stream in ROM. The second RNS gives Daemaneng charge of the DMS facility too, including mining logistics, marketing and processing. Essentially Ironveld are now a capital lite, royalty owner that isn't burdened with the risk that comes with such upstream and downstream activities but is subject to meaningful percentages of the profit. Also it's happening straight away, no delays. Daemaneng already on-site in Lapon with production and first ore deliveries to DMS plant expected any day (30 days from 7th Oct but can't say if we'll get updated immediately) and similarly commissioning will already be happening at the DMS plant with full handover of operations in the coming weeks. I consider it the two rns' combined as a major derisking that will be reflected in the  share price as the activity at mine site picks up and is reported to the market over the coming weeks and months.",

Hoping for steady progress through to 2026 when things should really ramp up and be at full production early Q2. If our sums are right this should produce healthy returns and a strong re rating of the shares. Iron have stated that they expect to give more regular updates once things are in action and proven to be happening (nice change from the old regime!) so I would hope to hear a progress update within the next two weeks.

Teams are totally aligned, and if there are any issues they will tackle them together and with speed. Within weeks we should have a good throughput and by Q2 I expect full production (if not before). By my sums we will soon be on a P/E of 2.5, which means every two and a half years we could buy back the whole company at the current SP (LT I know your figures are a lot better than mine!). So money will flow when people wake up and smell the magnetite. Also a share capitalisation should be on the cards once we are producing. Looking good IMHO and of course DYO research",

          "content": "With a little help from my friend AI. Ironveld PLC has made significant progress in de-risking and operationalising its Lapon mining site and associated Dense Media Separation (DMS) magnetite processing plant through partnerships with Daemaneng Minerals. The collaboration shifts capital and operational burdens to Daemaneng while preserving Ironveld's ownership, licence control, and revenue upside. Below is a contextual summary of the two prior updates in October and today's RNS (Nov 11, 2025), highlighting the progression toward integrated, low-cost production October 7th - Binding Mining Operations Agreement (Lapon Site). Key Details - Ironveld's 74%-owned subsidiary, Lapon Mining signed a five-year agreement with Daemaneng, making Daemaneng fully responsible for all mining activities at the Lapon site. This includes funding ~ZAR 500 million (approx. \u00a321.6 million) in capital and operational expenditure (e.g., equipment, logistics, labor, compliance, and on-site infrastructure). Daemaneng recovers costs from sales of run-of-mine (ROM) material, with no equity stake in Lapon Mining. Ironveld's Benefits: Eliminates Ironveld's direct mining costs and risks; guarantees ore supply to the DMS plant; introduces new revenue from ROM sales (managed by Daemaneng). Production ramp-up targeted within 30 days, with initial ROM offtake sales to generate near-term cash flow.  This \"defining moment\" (per CEO Kris Andersson) revives stalled operations at Lapon (previously mined in 2018) and aligns with Ironveld's capital-light strategy. October 30th - Binding Term Sheet for DMS Plant Operations. Key Details - Building on the mining agreement, Ironveld's subsidiary Altona  (operator of the JV DMS plant with Sable Exploration) signed a term sheet appointing Daemaneng as exclusive sub-contractor for plant management. Daemaneng handles all operations, logistics, and sales of DMS-grade magnetite, with revenues shared via a profit waterfall (guaranteed base per tonne for Altona/Sable). No capex/opex for Ironveld or partners. Ironveld's Benefits - Fully integrates mining-to-processing chain under Daemaneng's oversight; Daemaneng acts as sales agent, ensuring market access without Ironveld's financial exposure. Targets rapid mobilization leveraging Daemaneng's site familiarity. Complements the October 7 deal to create a \"performance-driven, capital-light\" model, positioning Ironveld for scalable growth and profitability without upfront costs. Today's news - Operational Progress Update. Key Details - follows the October agreements, confirming on-schedule preparations for DMS plant restart. Highlights include - Delivery of a new Caterpillar generator to the site on November 10, 2025, for power reliability. Phased handover, processing of stockpiled material to begin \"later this week\"; full inspections, pipework/crusher optimizations, and additional equipment (e.g., screens, excavators) deliveries imminent. /1",

CEO Andersson noted the \"commitment and progress\" of Daemaneng, aligning with prior timelines for rapid ramp-up.

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January. With a large shareholding I am really excited at the opportunity they now have and the last RNS showed how serious they are in really getting this going",

The exact extent I don\u2019t know, but it will be several weeks at least and probably delay our mining progress.

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive.

Daemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the actual sales price, with any remaining profit (i.e., actual sales price less base revenue and commission) being shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng. This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma. Valuations have resurged of late, and almost brought the country back in line with\u00a0other emergents...",

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January. With a large shareholding I am really excited at the opportunity they now have and the last RNS showed how serious they are in really getting this going",

But they had raised cash just prior, this time I think they do a raise during suspension - but let\u2019s see what happens eh, just my best guess.

The flooding is awful and I am sure the mine and surrounding roads are affected. Although the forecast for next week is dry and 30 degrees, there will be a large cleanup and mending of infrastructure needed.  The exact extent I don\u2019t know, but it will be several weeks at least and probably delay our mining progress. It won\u2019t stop us gaining new customers and continuing to promote the mine, but will delay meaningful output. The article was a good find, albeit disappointing info! SD",

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive. And at the moment there is no sign of a fund raise and I would be surprised if there was. Anything positive to say for a change?",

Daemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the actual sales price, with any remaining profit (i.e., actual sales price less base revenue and commission) being shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng. This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

Speaking at the inaugural Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg this week, he promised to adopt a new fiscal anchor. This won\u2019t be straightforward. The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma. Valuations have resurged of late, and almost brought the country back in line with\u00a0other emergents...",

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January. With a large shareholding I am really excited at the opportunity they now have and the last RNS showed how serious they are in really getting this going",

Consequently, the Board of Ironveld now expects the FY25 Accounts to be published by the end of February 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored.\nNotwithstanding the ongoing suspension of trading in the Company's shares, Ironveld will continue to make announcements as and when there are any developments that require to be notified under the AIM Rules\u00a0for Companies.\nOperational Update\nThe widely reported regional flooding in Limpopo, South Africa has temporarily impacted site access and operational activities at the Lapon Mine and the Company's Dense Media Separation (DMS) processing plant, which is held through a joint venture (\"JV\") with\nSable Platinum Holdings (Pty) Ltd and\nmanaged by contractor Daemaneng. Daemaneng is preparing to mobilise resources to commence dewatering of the pit and will perform the necessary repairs to restore full site accessibility. Subject to weather conditions, which are forecast to improve, operations are expected to return to normal within one month.\nTo mitigate the risk of extreme weather events on the Company's future operations, the design process for comprehensive water management infrastructure has been completed, and it is expected that this infrastructure will be operational during Q2, 2026.\nDMS Off-take\nOn 23 December 2025, the Company confirmed that it was in advanced discussions with a client regarding an offtake agreement for DMS grade magnetite. These discussions remain active and are progressing positively, with the intention being to formalise an agreement for an initial 1,000-tonne (\"t\") trial of DMS magnetite. Due to the operational impact of regional flooding, it has been agreed with the client that the trial will now be scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2026. The potential for this trial to lead to a substantial annual offtake agreement, as previously indicated, remains unchanged.\nIn addition, the Company's contractor, Daemaneng, has successfully completed a second fully paid trial delivery of DMS-grade magnetite to an established South African client, who has indicated a potential off-take capacity of 5,000 tonnes per month (\"tpm\").\nRun-of-Mine Off-take\n\u200b\nThe Company is pleased to confirm that Daemaneng has now concluded key commercial terms for a significant off-take agreement with a South African client for an initial 25,000t trial of Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore from the Lapon Mine, supported by an agreed ZAR 3 million (approx. GBP138,000) prepayment. The agreement is expected to be formally executed imminently, with the potential to evolve into a 12-month contract.\nDaemaneng Strategic Partnership\nIronveld's operating partner, Daemaneng, continues to be in advanced and exclusive discussions regarding a strategic marketing agreement with an established German trading house with a longstanding presence in Southern Africa.\nThe prospective off-take partner has expressed a clear intent to secure the entirety of Lapon's ROM output. The envisaged arrangement would follow a phased implementation plan, with off-take volumes scaling progressively to a target of up to 300,000tpm. Furthermore, the group has proposed financial and strategic support to facilitate the operational scale-up to achieve these targeted volumes.\nConcurrently, the group has expressed significant commercial interest in the Company's DMS-grade magnetite product, with an indicated demand profile that substantially exceeds the current planned production capacity of the DMS plant.\nCommercial Pipeline\nThe Company, together with Daemaneng, is encouraged by the levels of inbound enquiries and maintains active negotiations regarding potential off-take agreements for its DMS-grade magnetite and ROM products with other potential clients.\nIt should be noted that the Company's and Daemaneng's commercial negotiations on certain DMS and ROM products remain subject to further negotiation and no binding terms have been agreed. While the progress and level of interest are highly encouraging, there can be no certainty that final agreements will be reached.\nFurther updates will be provided in due course.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"While the immediate logistical and operational impact of the recent flooding is acknowledged, our strategic outlook for the business is overwhelmingly positive. Our focus is firmly on capturing the significant opportunities we see across our product portfolio.\n\"The advanced discussions for our en",

Potential offtake agreement with this partner to 300,000tpm! Alongside this the client has expressed interest in the DMS-grade magnetite 'exceeding the current planned production capacity of the DMS plant' - Completed a second fully paid trial delivery of magnetite who has indicated an interest in taking 5000tpm. Some disappointments but a genuine excuse with the severe flooding at such an inauspicious time - overall i'm quite comforted by this update and whilst it's never ideal to be suspended for months it sounds like later this quarter we could well have seen significant operational progress and shares trading again.",

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive. And at the moment there is no sign of a fund raise and I would be surprised if there was. Anything positive to say for a change?",

Daemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the actual sales price, with any remaining profit (i.e., actual sales price less base revenue and commission) being shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng. This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

Speaking at the inaugural Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg this week, he promised to adopt a new fiscal anchor. This won\u2019t be straightforward. The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma. Valuations have resurged of late, and almost brought the country back in line with\u00a0other emergents...",

          "content": "The audit of the FY25 Accounts is now substantially complete and the Company's UK auditor will shortly be commencing its review procedures. Consequently, the Board of Ironveld now expects the FY25 Accounts to be published by the end of February 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored. The widely reported regional flooding in Limpopo, South Africa has temporarily impacted site access and operational activities at the Lapon Mine and the Company's Dense Media Separation (DMS) processing plant, which is held through a joint venture (\"JV\") with Sable Platinum Holdings (Pty) Ltd and managed by contractor Daemaneng. Daemaneng is preparing to mobilise resources to commence dewatering of the pit and will perform the necessary repairs to restore full site accessibility. Subject to weather conditions, which are forecast to improve, operations are expected to return to normal within one month. To mitigate the risk of extreme weather events on the Company's future operations, the design process for comprehensive water management infrastructure has been completed, and it is expected that this infrastructure will be operational during Q2, 2026. DMS Off-take On 23 December 2025, the Company confirmed that it was in advanced discussions with a client regarding an offtake agreement for DMS grade magnetite. These discussions remain active and are progressing positively, with the intention being to formalise an agreement for an initial 1,000-tonne (\"t\") trial of DMS magnetite. Due to the operational impact of regional flooding, it has been agreed with the client that the trial will now be scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2026. The potential for this trial to lead to a substantial annual offtake agreement, as previously indicated, remains unchanged. In addition, the Company's contractor, Daemaneng, has successfully completed a second fully paid trial delivery of DMS-grade magnetite to an established South African client, who has indicated a potential off-take capacity of 5,000 tonnes per month (\"tpm\"). Run-of-Mine Off-take \u200b The Company is pleased to confirm that Daemaneng has now concluded key commercial terms for a significant off-take agreement with a South African client for an initial 25,000t trial of Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore from the Lapon Mine, supported by an agreed ZAR 3 million (approx. GBP138,000) prepayment. The agreement is expected to be formally executed imminently, with the potential to evolve into a 12-month contract.",

This is the one quoted as being worth $11.5m annually). - The 25000t ROM trial has concluded with a prepayment (\u00a3138k) so this is better news. Potential offtake agreement with this partner to 300,000tpm! Alongside this the client has expressed interest in the DMS-grade magnetite 'exceeding the current planned production capacity of the DMS plant' - Completed a second fully paid trial delivery of magnetite who has indicated an interest in taking 5000tpm. Some disappointments but a genuine excuse with the severe flooding at such an inauspicious time - overall i'm quite comforted by this update and whilst it's never ideal to be suspended for months it sounds like later this quarter we could well have seen significant operational progress and shares trading again.",

The exact extent I don\u2019t know, but it will be several weeks at least and probably delay our mining progress.

Truth is accounts are delayed a few weeks (like last year), which is poor but not a game changer in any shape or form. Cash is going to start flowing in early in 2026, and deals are being agreed. They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive. And at the moment there is no sign of a fund raise and I would be surprised if there was. Anything positive to say for a change?",

This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

Speaking at the inaugural Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg this week, he promised to adopt a new fiscal anchor. This won\u2019t be straightforward. The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma.

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January. With a large shareholding I am really excited at the opportunity they now have and the last RNS showed how serious they are in really getting this going",

Consequently, the Board of Ironveld now expects the FY25 Accounts to be published by the end of February 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored. The widely reported regional flooding in Limpopo, South Africa has temporarily impacted site access and operational activities at the Lapon Mine and the Company's Dense Media Separation (DMS) processing plant, which is held through a joint venture (\"JV\") with Sable Platinum Holdings (Pty) Ltd and managed by contractor Daemaneng. Daemaneng is preparing to mobilise resources to commence dewatering of the pit and will perform the necessary repairs to restore full site accessibility. Subject to weather conditions, which are forecast to improve, operations are expected to return to normal within one month. To mitigate the risk of extreme weather events on the Company's future operations, the design process for comprehensive water management infrastructure has been completed, and it is expected that this infrastructure will be operational during Q2, 2026. DMS Off-take On 23 December 2025, the Company confirmed that it was in advanced discussions with a client regarding an offtake agreement for DMS grade magnetite. These discussions remain active and are progressing positively, with the intention being to formalise an agreement for an initial 1,000-tonne (\"t\") trial of DMS magnetite. Due to the operational impact of regional flooding, it has been agreed with the client that the trial will now be scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2026. The potential for this trial to lead to a substantial annual offtake agreement, as previously indicated, remains unchanged. In addition, the Company's contractor, Daemaneng, has successfully completed a second fully paid trial delivery of DMS-grade magnetite to an established South African client, who has indicated a potential off-take capacity of 5,000 tonnes per month (\"tpm\"). Run-of-Mine Off-take \u200b The Company is pleased to confirm that Daemaneng has now concluded key commercial terms for a significant off-take agreement with a South African client for an initial 25,000t trial of Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore from the Lapon Mine, supported by an agreed ZAR 3 million (approx. GBP138,000) prepayment. The agreement is expected to be formally executed imminently, with the potential to evolve into a 12-month contract.",

          "content": "- Accounts delayed til end of February. - As expected there's been some impact from the flooding in Limpopo, a month away from operations fully resuming. - The 1000t DMS magnetite trial in q1 has been shifted to q2. This is the one quoted as being worth $11.5m annually). - The 25000t ROM trial has concluded with a prepayment (\u00a3138k) so this is better news. Potential offtake agreement with this partner to 300,000tpm! Alongside this the client has expressed interest in the DMS-grade magnetite 'exceeding the current planned production capacity of the DMS plant' - Completed a second fully paid trial delivery of magnetite who has indicated an interest in taking 5000tpm. Some disappointments but a genuine excuse with the severe flooding at such an inauspicious time - overall i'm quite comforted by this update and whilst it's never ideal to be suspended for months it sounds like later this quarter we could well have seen significant operational progress and shares trading again.",

The exact extent I don\u2019t know, but it will be several weeks at least and probably delay our mining progress. It won\u2019t stop us gaining new customers and continuing to promote the mine, but will delay meaningful output. The article was a good find, albeit disappointing info! SD",

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive.

Daemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the actual sales price, with any remaining profit (i.e., actual sales price less base revenue and commission) being shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng. This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

Speaking at the inaugural Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg this week, he promised to adopt a new fiscal anchor. This won\u2019t be straightforward. The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma. Valuations have resurged of late, and almost brought the country back in line with\u00a0other emergents...",

Also from my own experience, reading between the lines, extensive research and Turner Pope briefings. I believe I am probably 80% plus correct on this. Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January. With a large shareholding I am really excited at the opportunity they now have and the last RNS showed how serious they are in really getting this going",

Consequently, the Board of Ironveld now expects the FY25 Accounts to be published by the end of February 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored. The widely reported regional flooding in Limpopo, South Africa has temporarily impacted site access and operational activities at the Lapon Mine and the Company's Dense Media Separation (DMS) processing plant, which is held through a joint venture (\"JV\") with Sable Platinum Holdings (Pty) Ltd and managed by contractor Daemaneng. Daemaneng is preparing to mobilise resources to commence dewatering of the pit and will perform the necessary repairs to restore full site accessibility. Subject to weather conditions, which are forecast to improve, operations are expected to return to normal within one month. To mitigate the risk of extreme weather events on the Company's future operations, the design process for comprehensive water management infrastructure has been completed, and it is expected that this infrastructure will be operational during Q2, 2026. DMS Off-take On 23 December 2025, the Company confirmed that it was in advanced discussions with a client regarding an offtake agreement for DMS grade magnetite. These discussions remain active and are progressing positively, with the intention being to formalise an agreement for an initial 1,000-tonne (\"t\") trial of DMS magnetite. Due to the operational impact of regional flooding, it has been agreed with the client that the trial will now be scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2026. The potential for this trial to lead to a substantial annual offtake agreement, as previously indicated, remains unchanged. In addition, the Company's contractor, Daemaneng, has successfully completed a second fully paid trial delivery of DMS-grade magnetite to an established South African client, who has indicated a potential off-take capacity of 5,000 tonnes per month (\"tpm\"). Run-of-Mine Off-take \u200b The Company is pleased to confirm that Daemaneng has now concluded key commercial terms for a significant off-take agreement with a South African client for an initial 25,000t trial of Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore from the Lapon Mine, supported by an agreed ZAR 3 million (approx. GBP138,000) prepayment. The agreement is expected to be formally executed imminently, with the potential to evolve into a 12-month contract.",

Potential offtake agreement with this partner to 300,000tpm! Alongside this the client has expressed interest in the DMS-grade magnetite 'exceeding the current planned production capacity of the DMS plant' - Completed a second fully paid trial delivery of magnetite who has indicated an interest in taking 5000tpm. Some disappointments but a genuine excuse with the severe flooding at such an inauspicious time - overall i'm quite comforted by this update and whilst it's never ideal to be suspended for months it sounds like later this quarter we could well have seen significant operational progress and shares trading again.",

They take time and Demang only started on site end of Nov so give them a few weeks to agree concrete deals man, they don\u2019t happen overnight. Delayed accounts change nothing about the fundamentals, the business is moving forward and will soon be cashflow positive. And at the moment there is no sign of a fund raise and I would be surprised if there was. Anything positive to say for a change?",

Daemaneng receives a commission of 6% of the actual sales price, with any remaining profit (i.e., actual sales price less base revenue and commission) being shared equally in three parts between Altona, Sable, and Daemaneng. This is expected to rise sharply as the scale of production is ramped up. \" \"it will assume full responsibility for ore supply, quality and logistics, while acting as the JV\u2019s exclusive marketing and sales agent for all DMS-grade magnetite produced\". \"agreement brings together complementary expertise and shared ambition to unlock the full operational potential of Ironveld\u2019s assets, projects DMS-grade output reaching 15,000 tonnes/month by April 2026, while eliminating all mining capital and operating cost exposure for both Ironveld and its JV partners\". \"Ironveld is equipped to support all operations between now and the JV achieving sustained DSM-grade production in just six or so months from now\"",

Speaking at the inaugural Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg this week, he promised to adopt a new fiscal anchor. This won\u2019t be straightforward. The ruling coalition is fragile, and this is likely to face political opposition. Still, he\u2019s determined to push through the reform to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio this fiscal year. That will hinge on a spending restraint that\u2019s likely to upset voters. But inflation, which accelerated less than expected, remains within the central bank\u2019s comfort zone, possibly mitigating the painful effects of fiscal consolidation.  Consumer prices rose 3.6% in October, compared with 3.4% a month earlier. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 Yvonne Mhango sees inflation climbing to 3.9% by year-end, although she expects a stronger rand and faster-than-expected fiscal tightening to help contain the rise.  It remains in South Africa\u2019s interest to keep Washington at arm\u2019s length.",

          "content": "Nice write up on Bberg, especially re market sentiment improving and reduction in corruption and energy cuts: \"In May, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa arrived at the White House hoping to dislodge Trump\u2019s allegations of a so-called \u201cwhite genocide\u201d that the administration used to levy punitive tariffs on imports from the country. Ramaphosa received a dressing-down and left Washington empty-handed.  The meeting worsened already frayed ties, culminating in Trump\u2019s boycott of this week\u2019s G-20 summit in Johannesburg. The 30% tariff remains in place, threatening to derail the economy just as painstaking reforms were beginning to take hold. And yet South African assets are thriving in ways few in Washington or Pretoria anticipated.   Last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered an impressive budget update in which revenue exceeded previous projections, prompting the National Treasury to double down on its fiscal-consolidation plans. Inflation\u2019s trajectory has turned, enabling the central bank to target 3% inflation rather than a 3% to 6% band. Another vote of confidence came from S&P Global Ratings, which upgraded South Africa\u2019s credit assessment for the first time since 2005 and kept a positive outlook. Few would have predicted such an endorsement in the immediate aftermath of Washington\u2019s tariff shock. The weak dollar has helped. The rand gained almost 10% this year, while South African 10-year credit default swaps are at their lowest since 2014 as the cost of financing dollar-denominated debt eases. Equities have widened their lead against emerging market peers. With the US row still casting a long shadow, the market activity suggests a deeper confidence in reform momentum. A serious breakdown in relations with Washington isn\u2019t trivial. Trade and investment ties remain vital. But the gains from Pretoria\u2019s policy overhaul are hard to ignore. This is most evident in the near-elimination of the crippling power shortages that had been a defining symbol of economic malaise. For now, as yields on the country\u2019s benchmark bonds plunge, bullish sentiments are their highest in two decades. These green shoots are encouraging for an economy long hobbled by entrenched corruption and brazen, violent crime. The reforms are encouraging private investment in ailing state-owned enterprises in energy and logistics. Land reforms that draw the ire of Elon Musk, a former Trump ally, are also ongoing.  And there was the vintage selloff ahead of last year\u2019s elections which created great a chance to buy. The surprising stability since the vote also helped to expand the multiples that investors are prepared to pay for South African stocks. It\u00a0long commanded a premium to the rest of the emerging world, which was wiped out under former President Jacob Zuma. Valuations have resurged of late, and almost brought the country back in line with\u00a0other emergents...",

Remember D\u2019mang have invested a lot into this and will be wanting to utilise their machinery to produce ore and DMS as quickly as possible once they have got the  calibration correct, which should be around now. They then need to find buyers, and the last RNS showed how quickly we are moving towards trials and then contracts. The market in SA for ore and magnetite is strong, so I expect them to really push ahead from the mid/ end of January.
