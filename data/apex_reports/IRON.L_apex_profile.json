          "content": "3 Feb 2026 17:34\nRNS Number : 5917R\nIronveld PLC\n03 February 2026\n3 February 2026\nIronveld PLC\nUpdate on Operations & Publication of FY25 Accounts\nIronveld PLC (\"Ironveld\" or the \"Company\"), the mining development company focused on producing high-value strategic metals, provides the following update regarding the Company's audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 (\"FY25 Accounts\").\nThe audit of the FY25 Accounts is now substantially complete and the Company's UK auditor will shortly be commencing its review procedures. Consequently, the Board of Ironveld now expects the FY25 Accounts to be published by the end of February 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored.\nNotwithstanding the ongoing suspension of trading in the Company's shares, Ironveld will continue to make announcements as and when there are any developments that require to be notified under the AIM Rules\u00a0for Companies.\nOperational Update\nThe widely reported regional flooding in Limpopo, South Africa has temporarily impacted site access and operational activities at the Lapon Mine and the Company's Dense Media Separation (DMS) processing plant, which is held through a joint venture (\"JV\") with\nSable Platinum Holdings (Pty) Ltd and\nmanaged by contractor Daemaneng. Daemaneng is preparing to mobilise resources to commence dewatering of the pit and will perform the necessary repairs to restore full site accessibility. Subject to weather conditions, which are forecast to improve, operations are expected to return to normal within one month.\nTo mitigate the risk of extreme weather events on the Company's future operations, the design process for comprehensive water management infrastructure has been completed, and it is expected that this infrastructure will be operational during Q2, 2026.\nDMS Off-take\nOn 23 December 2025, the Company confirmed that it was in advanced discussions with a client regarding an offtake agreement for DMS grade magnetite. These discussions remain active and are progressing positively, with the intention being to formalise an agreement for an initial 1,000-tonne (\"t\") trial of DMS magnetite. Due to the operational impact of regional flooding, it has been agreed with the client that the trial will now be scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2026. The potential for this trial to lead to a substantial annual offtake agreement, as previously indicated, remains unchanged.\nIn addition, the Company's contractor, Daemaneng, has successfully completed a second fully paid trial delivery of DMS-grade magnetite to an established South African client, who has indicated a potential off-take capacity of 5,000 tonnes per month (\"tpm\").\nRun-of-Mine Off-take\n\u200b\nThe Company is pleased to confirm that Daemaneng has now concluded key commercial terms for a significant off-take agreement with a South African client for an initial 25,000t trial of Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore from the Lapon Mine, supported by an agreed ZAR 3 million (approx. GBP138,000) prepayment. The agreement is expected to be formally executed imminently, with the potential to evolve into a 12-month contract.\nDaemaneng Strategic Partnership\nIronveld's operating partner, Daemaneng, continues to be in advanced and exclusive discussions regarding a strategic marketing agreement with an established German trading house with a longstanding presence in Southern Africa.\nThe prospective off-take partner has expressed a clear intent to secure the entirety of Lapon's ROM output. The envisaged arrangement would follow a phased implementation plan, with off-take volumes scaling progressively to a target of up to 300,000tpm. Furthermore, the group has proposed financial and strategic support to facilitate the operational scale-up to achieve these targeted volumes.\nConcurrently, the group has expressed significant commercial interest in the Company's DMS-grade magnetite product, with an indicated demand profile that substantially exceeds the current planned production capacity of the DMS plant.\nCommercial Pipeline\nThe Company, together with Daemaneng, is encouraged by the levels of inbound enquiries and maintains active negotiations regarding potential off-take agreements for its DMS-grade magnetite and ROM products with other potential clients.\nIt should be noted that the Company's and Daemaneng's commercial negotiations on certain DMS and ROM products remain subject to further negotiation and no binding terms have been agreed. While the progress and level of interest are highly encouraging, there can be no certainty that final agreements will be reached.\nFurther updates will be provided in due course.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"While the immediate logistical and operational impact of the recent flooding is acknowledged, our strategic outlook for the business is overwhelmingly positive. Our focus is firmly on capturing the significant opportunities we see across our product portfolio.\n\"The advanced discussions for our entire projected ROM output highlight a commercial opportunity greater than initially anticipated. The proposed long-term off-take framework envisions a\u00a0gradual, multi-phased ramp-up\u00a0to a target volume of 300,000 tonnes per month,\u00a0which would be achieved over time.\u00a0The specific proposal to provide both strategic and financial backing to Daemaneng for the operational scale-up demonstrates a high degree of commitment and validates the strategic value of the magnetite ore from Lapon.\n\"Alongside this, the sustained interest in the DMS grade magnetite, which exceeds our JV's projected maximum plant capacity, highlights the strong market demand as well as providing clear commercial validation for our assets.\n\"Our priority is now to advance these parallel discussions to formal agreements. We look forward to updating shareholders on the progress being made to commercialise both our ROM and DMS product streams, which together form a compelling and diversified growth strategy for Ironveld.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"UK MAR\"), which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The Company also confirms that there has been a delay to the preparation of its audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025 (\"FY25 Accounts\") and the FY25 Accounts will therefore not be published by 31 December 2025, the deadline under AIM Rule 19. Consequently, the Company's shares will be temporarily suspended from trading on AIM as of 7.30 a.m. on 2 January 2026, pending publication of the FY25 Accounts.\nOperational Update\nSecured Commercial Milestone: Initial Pre-Paid Trial Order\nThe Company has secured its first, client pre-paid, trial order for Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") grade magnetite for its joint venture. This initial commercial transaction, which involves pre-payment prior to collection, is a critical step in the product qualification process. Successful completion is intended to lead to a larger 12-month offtake contract with this client.\nAdvanced Offtake Discussions: Major Market Opportunity Progress\nIronveld is pleased to report that discussions with a blue-chip mining house for DMS grade magnetite have progressed substantially. The prospective partner has expressed a clear intention to procure a\u00a01,000-tonne trial order in the first quarter of 2026 (\"Q1\"). This trial is anticipated to serve as a precursor to a significant annual offtake agreement, with a potential scale in the region of\u00a0ZAR 180 million per annum. While not yet finalised, these advanced talks demonstrate the strong market demand and validation for the DMS grade magnetite material.\nExpanding Sales Pipeline & Product Diversification\nThe Company, working closely with Daemaneng Minerals (Pty) Ltd (\"Daemaneng\"), is engaged in discussions with a number of additional counterparties in relation to potential contracts for its DMS-grade magnetite and Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") unprocessed ore. The ROM product represents a prospective new revenue stream, with initial revenues from Lapon Mining (Pty) Ltd (\"Lapon Mining\") expected to commence in early 2026. The continued expansion of the Company's sales pipeline reflects increasing market interest and supports the Company's strategy to diversify its revenue base. The opportunity to sell our ROM product has advanced to the final stages of negotiation for a trial order of approximately 25,000 tonnes, which is anticipated to be delivered in early 2026. Subject to the successful completion of this trial and agreement on final commercial terms, the parties intend to consider a longer-term, consistent offtake arrangement.\nStrategic Marketing Partnership to Drive Growth\nThe Company's operating partner, Daemaneng, is in the final stages of concluding a strategic marketing agreement with an established German trading house with a longstanding presence in Southern Africa. The proposed partnership is intended to leverage the trading house's extensive regional networks to accelerate commercial development, with a focus on securing new customers across South Africa, Botswana and other Southern African jurisdictions. Subject to finalisation, initial business contributions are anticipated to commence in Q1.\nThe partnership is expected to support an expansion of the planned DMS plant to accommodate increased throughput, with capacity envisaged to approximately double relative to the currently planned configuration.\nIn addition, access to Asian end-markets is expected to underpin increased demand for ROM product, including the potential for regular, vessel-sized shipments.\nOperational Readiness: Plant Optimisation on Track / Mining Operations\nConcurrently, Daemaneng continues to make steady progress on planned plant improvements and optimisation initiatives. These works are strategically focused on ensuring operational reliability and capacity and product quality align seamlessly with the anticipated demand growth through 2026 and beyond. Daemaneng has assumed full operational responsibility for the DMS plant operations as well as Mining Operations at Lapon Mining.\nDelay to Publication of FY25 Accounts\nDespite the best efforts of all parties, Ironveld requires further time for its auditors to complete certain procedures relating to the audit of the Company's FY25 Accounts, with the delay primarily related to completion of audit-related procedures in South Africa. The Directors have provided the information requested to the Company's advisers in South Africa and are working with its audit advisers to complete the audit process as soon as possible.\nThe Company anticipates that it will publish the FY25 Accounts during January 2026, following which trading in Ironveld's shares will be restored. A further announcement will be made in due course.\nNotwithstanding the temporary suspension of trading in the Company's shares, Ironveld will continue to make announcements as and when there are any developments that require to be notified under the AIM Rules\u00a0for Companies.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"This update demonstrates meaningful momentum across commercial, strategic, and operational fronts. The secured, pre-paid trial order is our first tangible market validation, and the advanced discussions for a landmark contract signal the scale of the opportunity before us. Daemaneng's new strategic marketing partnership provides a robust platform for growth. Ironveld remains focused on executing its strategy to become a significant supplier of high-quality magnetite products.

Key commissioning and readiness activities have been completed, including confirming the Plant's power draw and procuring a new containerised Caterpillar generator, with the existing unit now designated as a backup. The new generator, along with diesel fuel, was effectively delivered to the Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\") site yesterday.\nDaemaneng is also engaged in advanced and developing offtake discussions with several counterparties for the Plant's future production.\nThe planned schedule leading up to the formal operational handover to Daemaneng, in their capacity as sub-contractor of the Plant,\u00a0includes the following scheduled workstreams:\n\u00b7\nThe new generator will be connected to the Plant, followed by comprehensive mechanical and electrical inspections, including greasing, oil fill-ups and live testing of all equipment. Final manpower allocations for the operational phase will also be completed.\n\u00b7\nThe focus will then shift to critical process optimisations. This includes the delivery of a 30-tonne screen, one excavator, one front-end loader and other supporting equipment as production ramps up in the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nOn the DMS site, the replacement of essential pipework and adjustments to the crushers, mill trommel and magnetic separation units will take place. The Plant is then scheduled to begin processing stockpiled material through the circuit.\n\u00b7\nTo further support operational readiness,\nthree storage containers, which are equipped with a comprehensive suite of spare parts, maintenance equipment and tools\nwill also arrive on site.\n\u00b7\nThe establishment of prefabricated on-site office facilities and the finalisation of product shedding procedures will complete the preparatory phase scheduled for this week.\nThis structured approach ensures all safety and compliance protocols are addressed, with relevant Certificates of Compliance being reviewed and documentation for high-risk activities prepared and validated.\nStructured Community Engagement\nAlongside this structured approach to safety, Daemaneng has appointed its HR Manager, Mrs. Bongiwe Nkosi, as a dedicated community liaison. Under the direct oversight of Ironveld's Group Compliance Manager, Mr. Bernard Ntuli, Mrs. Nkosi will support initiatives related to local employment, supplier development and the procurement of services. Mr. Ntuli remains the official and sole point of contact for all formal communication. An introductory meeting was held yesterday with the Lekhureng community, which is in the closest proximity to our operations and was very well-received. Further meetings with other relevant communities are scheduled for the remainder of the week. Mr. Ntuli reports directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson.\nOperational Oversight and Control\nIronveld, as the appointed operator, retains full operational oversight and control of the DMS plant and mining operations. This is managed through Mr. Tebogo Phetla, who acts as Ironveld's senior on-site representative, providing direct oversight and serving as the primary liaison with the Daemaneng operational team. In this capacity, Mr. Phetla is responsible for monitoring all activities, collecting and compiling operational reports from Plant Manager, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, and reporting these directly to Ironveld PLC CEO, Kris Andersson. Mr. Phetla's extensive project management experience and long-standing involvement with the project since its inception are key to this role.\nDMS Plant Expertise to Lead Operations and to Drive Plant Performance\nAs mentioned, Mr. Victor Mkhaliphi, from the Daemaneng team, will be the Plant Manager overseeing the DMS Plant operations. Mr. Mkhaliphi brings extensive and directly relevant experience to this critical role, including:\n\u00b7\nProven Leadership in DMS Operation: Recently led the full construction and commissioning of a large-scale 200 tonnes-per-hour DMS plant.\n\u00b7\nDemonstrated Record in Process Optimisation: Has a demonstrated history of improving DMS plant performance, including achieving a 12% reduction in magnetite losses at a coal DMS plant and increasing diamond recovery by 7% across multiple diamond DMS plants.\n\u00b7\nExtensive DMS Technical Knowledge: His background as a Senior Metallurgical Engineer involved designing and reviewing DMS plants, auditing DMS units and implementing process control models to enhance efficiency.\nKris Andersson, CEO of Ironveld, commented:\n\"We are very pleased with the commitment and progress demonstrated by the Daemaneng team. The project remains on schedule and in line with our previously communicated milestones, and it is particularly encouraging that Daemaneng will be running material through the Plant later this week. This marks a significant and tangible step forward in moving from preparation into early production.\n\"I am confident we can achieve our production targets, leveraging the dedicated work and support of the Ironveld team alongside Victor's hands-on DMS expertise in both commissioning and optimising DMS plants combined with the additional experience and leadership of the wider Daemaneng team, provides us with a significant advantage as we ramp up operations.\n\"Overall, this phase represents a clear demonstration of the partnership's capability to deliver results, and we are now well-positioned for continued operational progress. We look forward to providing further updates on key milestones as they are achieved.\"\nFigure 1\n- The Ironveld and Daemaneng leadership teams at the plant and mine site (on 6 November, 2025, from left to right\n): Bernard Ntuli (Ironveld Group Compliance Manager), Kris Andersson (Ironveld CEO), Glenn Norton (Daemaneng CEO), Victor Mkhaliphi (Daemaneng Plant Manager) and Tebogo Phetla (Ironveld Operations Manager).\nFigure 2 -\nCaterpillar\ngenerator offloaded at DMS site (on 10 November, 2025)\nFor further information, please contact:\nIronveld plc\nKristoffer Andersson, Chief Executive Officer\nc/o BlytheRay\n+44 20 7138 3204\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Nomad and Broker)\nDerrick Lee\n+44 20 7220 0500\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Thacker / James Pope\n+44 20 3657 0050\nBlytheRay\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray\n+44 20 7138 3204\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

      "bear_case": "If the project stalls or the funding falls through, the price could slide a bit further, but the 70\u201195% drop has already removed the bulk of weak hands. The worst that could happen is a modest additional decline.",
