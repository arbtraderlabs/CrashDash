Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nQuarterly Activities Report\nFor the period ending 31 December 2025\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nArtemis Resources Limited ('\nArtemis'\nor the\n'Company\n') (\nASX:\nARV\n) is pleased to provide its Quarterly Activities Report for the period ended 31 December 2025 (the quarter).\nDuring the quarter, the Company delivered a significant exploration breakthrough at the Titan East prospect within the Karratha Gold-Copper Project, advanced development studies at Carlow, and expanded its copper growth pipeline through the execution of a new earn-in and joint venture agreement in the Madura Province. Artemis also entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to collaboratively assess processing options for the Elizabeth Hill Silver mine and positioned its technical team for drilling programs scheduled in early 2026.\nQuarter Highlights (December 2025)\n\u00b7\nTitan East discovery breakthrough:\nConfirmation of a new shear-hosted gold system with high-grade results of\n5m @ 13.1g/t Au\n(25ARRC006) and\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au\n(25ARRC025), supporting an emerging mineralised trend over approximately\n600m strike\nand triggering follow-up diamond drilling\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025 and 19 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nCarlow development studies initiated:\nCommencement of a conceptual mining study to assess potential open pit and underground development scenarios in parallel with planned extensional drilling\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 17 November 2025).\n\u00b7\nMadura Province expansion:\nExecution of an earn-in and joint venture agreement with Red Metal Limited to earn up to\n60% of the Sharon Dam IOCG Project\n, establishing a second district-scale copper growth opportunity alongside Cassowary\n(refer to ASX announcements dated 24 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nRadio Hill optionality advanced:\nSigning of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with West Coast Silver to assess the suitability of the Radio Hill Processing Plant for potential toll treatment opportunities\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 4 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nPost-quarter corporate update:\nJulian Hanna transitioned from Technical Director to Project Manager (Cassowary and Sharon Dam) under a consultancy agreement effective 1 January 2026 (refer to ASX announcement dated 31 December 2025). Artemis announced its intention to delist from the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange, with the objective of reducing costs and compliance overheads\u00a0and consolidating trading liquidity on ASX\u00a0(refer ASX announcement dated 15 January 2025).\nKarratha Gold-Copper Project\nTitan East Gold Discovery\nThe December quarter was headlined by a transition from exploration targeting to discovery at the Titan East prospect, located approximately 1.5km northwest of the Carlow Gold-Copper Resource\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025).\nAssay results from the first reverse circulation (RC) hole drilled to test a newly identified north-east trending shear zone returned a high-grade intersection of\n5m @ 13.1g/t Au from 132m\nin hole\n25ARRC006\n, representing the first drilling to test this interpreted structural position\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025).\nFollow-up drilling confirmed continuity of mineralisation along the shear zone, with hole\n25ARRC025\nintersecting\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au from 127m\n, supporting the presence of a coherent mineralised system,\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 19 December 2025)\n.\nGold mineralisation is associated with vein quartz and alteration within a structural zone parallel to the Regal Thrust, the same regional-scale structure that hosts the Carlow deposit. The Titan East area is largely obscured by transported sediments, which has historically limited the effectiveness of surface exploration and highlights the importance of drilling-led discovery.\nIn response to these results, Artemis commenced diamond drilling during the quarter to define the geometry, orientation and potential scale of the mineralised shear zone. Diamond hole\n25ARDD006\nwas collared on 10 December 2025, with early core observations confirming successful intersection of the targeted structure at depth. Assay results were pending at quarter end\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 19 December 2025).\nNext steps (March 2026 quarter):\n\u00b7\nCompletion and assay of diamond drilling\n\u00b7\nFollow-up diamond drilling to test strike and depth continuity\n\u00b7\nIntegration of results into the Carlow-Titan geological model\nCarlow Gold-Copper Project\nThe Carlow Gold-Copper Project remains a cornerstone asset within Artemis' Pilbara portfolio, hosting a JORC 2012 Inferred Mineral Resource of\n374koz gold and 64kt copper\n(\nrefer to ASX announcement dated 13 October 2022)\n, which remains open along strike to the east and at depth below approximately\n380 metres vertical\n.\nDuring the quarter, Artemis commenced a\nconceptual mining study\n, being undertaken by independent consultants Snowden-Optiro,\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 17 November 2025),\nto assess potential development scenarios and support ongoing technical evaluation of the project.\nThe study is examining a range of open pit and underground optimisation concepts and is being conducted in parallel with planned extensional drilling. This work is being advanced against a materially stronger commodity price environment compared with the assumptions underpinning the October 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate.\nOutputs from the study are intended to guide near-term decision-making, including drill targeting priorities, resource growth opportunities, metallurgical sampling requirements and early-stage development pathways.\nNext steps (March 2026 quarter):\n\u00b7\nCompletion of the conceptual mining study\n\u00b7\nIntegration of drilling results into updated geological and development assessments\nFigure 1: Interpreted long section through the Titan-Carlow corridor showing geological and structural interpretation, Titan East discovery drill intersections and outline of the Carlow Mineral Resource.\nMadura Province - Copper Growth Strategy\nCassowary Exploration Project\nArtemis is systematically advancing its\n1,129km\u00b2 landholding\nalong the Madura Crustal Boundary in south-eastern Western Australia, targeting large-scale\nIOCG-style copper-gold systems\n.\nFollowing execution of the Land Access Agreement with the\nPila Nguru (Aboriginal Corporation) RNTBC\nin October 2025,\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 13 October 2025),\nthe Company has full operational access to the granted\n341km\u00b2 core exploration licence (E69/4266)\n.\nCassowary is centred on an interpreted intrusive complex situated along a major lithospheric boundary separating the Yilgarn Craton from the Albany-Fraser Orogen, a geological setting considered favourable for large-scale intrusion-related mineral systems.\nDuring the quarter, work programs were lodged for\nfour initial diamond drill sites\n, targeting the core of the interpreted Cassowary Intrusion (Target T1) and associated structural corridors. These programs are designed to test the presence of copper-gold mineralisation beneath transported cover.\nSharon Dam IOCG Project (Earn-In / Joint Venture)\nDuring the quarter, Artemis executed an\nEarn-In and Joint Venture agreement with Red Metal Limited\n(ASX:RDM) to secure a majority interest in the Sharon Dam IOCG Project,\n(refer to ASX announcements dated 24 December 2025),\nlocated approximately 50km south of Cassowary within the same regional structural corridor.\nSharon Dam is defined by a coincident magnetic and gravity anomaly interpreted to represent a prospective intrusive system concealed beneath approximately\n250 metres of transported cover\n, which is materially shallower than many comparable IOCG targets in Australia.\nUnder the agreement, Artemis may earn up to\n60% interest\nby spending\nA$5 million over three years\n, including a\nminimum A$400,000 drilling commitment within 12 months\n.\nThe project has an existing Exploration Incentive Scheme (EIS) co-funding allocation of up to approximately A$220,000, which will reduce net drilling costs but does not count toward the minimum expenditure requirement under the earn-in agreement.\nDrilling is targeted for late Q2\n2026\n, subject to heritage clearance.\nFigure 2\n: Location plan highlighting mineral deposits and occurrences associated with Proterozoic age crustal boundaries, parallel with the Yilgarn craton margin.

The program is an immediate follow-up to December quarter drilling that identified a coherent gold-bearing shear zone beneath shallow cover.\nFigure 1 -\nDiamond drilling underway at Titan East.\nArtemis Executive Director, Jozsef Patarica, commented:\n\"Titan East has moved quickly from a conceptual target under shallow cover to an emerging gold zone with genuine scale potential. The commencement of diamond drilling is the next step in tightening our geological understanding of the shear zone and positioning Artemis to execute a larger, targeted follow-up program. With Titan East only 1.5 kilometres from Carlow, success here has a clear pathway to near-term value creation.\"\nDiamond Drill Program - Titan East\nThe Titan East diamond drilling program will comprise two\nholes for approximately 450 metres\n, targeting the interpreted\nnorth-east trending shear zone\nthat hosts the recent gold intersections.\nKey objectives include:\n\u00b7\nStructural definition\n: obtain oriented core (where applicable) to confirm shear orientation, controls on mineralisation, and vein/alteration architecture.\n\u00b7\nContinuity testing:\nstep-out drilling to assess the extent of mineralisation along strike and down-dip from the discovery area.\n\u00b7\nSampling:\ngenerate high-quality core for detailed logging, structural measurements and representative assay sampling.\nFigure 2\n- Titan East location plan (Carlow-Titan Project).\nFigure 3\n- Planned diamond drill collars and interpreted Titan East shear zone.\nBackground - Titan East Discovery Context\nDecember quarter RC drilling at Titan East confirmed a previously untested mineralised structure beneath shallow cover, including a high-grade intercept in 25ARRC006\n[4]\nand a subsequent discovery intersection in 25ARRC025\n[5]\n. Artemis also completed a diamond hole in December to support geological interpretation, with further assays pending. These results are expected to underpin a substantial follow-up drilling campaign in early 2026.\nThis ASX announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Artemis Resources Limited.\nArtemis Resources Ltd\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director\nZeus (Nomad and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi / James Bavister\ninfo@artemisresources.com.au\nTel: + 44 20 3829 5000\nAbout Artemis Resources\nArtemis Resources (ASX/AIM: ARV)\nis an exploration company advancing a highly prospective portfolio of gold, copper and critical minerals projects in Western Australia.\nIn the underexplored North Pilbara province, Artemis holds the Carlow Gold-Copper Project and the Titan and Thorpe prospects.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nArtemis Resources Limited\n(\"Artemis\" or \"the Company\")\nCancellation of Admission to AIM\nArtemis Resources Limited (ASX/AIM:ARV)\nannounces the cancellation of the admission of its ordinary shares (\"Shares\") to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAIM\n\") (the \"\nCancellation\n\") in accordance with Rule 41 of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nAIM Rules\n\"). It is expected that the Cancellation will occur on 13 February 2026. The Company's primary listing is on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"\nASX\n\") and it has been admitted to trading on AIM since 7 February 2022.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFollowing the Cancellation, the Company's Shares will remain listed on the ASX, which will continue as the primary trading venue for its equity securities. The Company has no intention to delist its Shares from the ASX.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is providing an opportunity for each Depositary Interest (\"\nDI\n\") holder to become a registered shareholder on the Company's Australian share register.\nReasons for the AIM Cancellation\nThe Company is of the view that the Company's admission to trading on AIM is not delivering sufficient value to shareholders, having regard to the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of maintaining admission to trading on AIM, including professional fees, listing fees payable and incremental legal, auditing and other fees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of management time and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's admission to trading on AIM, in addition to its ASX listing,\n\u00b7\nconditions which have impacted stock markets generally since its admission to trading on AIM in February 2022 have made it more challenging to raise capital in the UK; and\n\u00b7\nthe relatively low levels of liquidity and trading volumes in the Company's Shares on AIM.\nThe Board considers the Cancellation will not materially nor adversely impact existing Shareholders as they will still be able to trade on the ASX.\nProcess for Cancellation\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange to cancel admission of the Shares to trading on AIM, and it is expected that the Cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13 February 2026.\nOn the basis that the Company's Shares will continue to be listed on ASX, which is an AIM Designated Market (as defined by the AIM Rules), the Company is not required to seek shareholder approval for the Cancellation.\nThe full timetable of expected events is set out at the end of this announcement.\nPrincipal effects and risks relating to the Cancellation\n\u00b7\nThe Company's Shares will no longer be traded on AIM and the Company has no intention to implement a matched bargain facility to enable trading post Cancellation in the UK;\n\u00b7\nremaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX;\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory and financial reporting regime, including but not limited to, the AIM Rules, the corporate governance requirements for companies trading on AIM and UK MAR, will no longer apply, but the regulatory framework of the ASX, including its corporate governance requirements, and Australian company law will still apply;\n\u00b7\nshareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules, such as the requirement to be notified of certain events, including substantial transactions, financing transactions and related party transactions, and the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain transactions, where applicable, such as reverse takeovers and fundamental changes in the Company's business; albeit similar protection may be afforded pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules, Australian company law and the Australian Corporations Act;\n\u00b7\nZeus Capital Limited will cease to act as nominated adviser and UK broker to the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe Cancellation might have either positive or negative taxation consequences for shareholders. Stamp duty may be due on transfers of Shares and agreements to transfer Shares unless a relevant exemption or relief applies to a particular transfer. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional independent tax advisers.\nThe above considerations are non-exhaustive and shareholders should seek their own independent advice (including tax, financial and legal) when assessing the likely impact of the Cancellation on them.\nInformation for Depositary Interest (DI) holders\nThe Company's Shares will continue to be traded on AIM until market close, being 4.30 p.m. London time, on 12 February 2026 after which, there will be no public market in the UK on which the Shares can be traded. In addition to the delisting, the Company will also be terminating the Depositary Interest service. After the closure of the DI facility on 24 February 2026, all remaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register (being Automic Pty Ltd) and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX. These Shares will be held on the Australian share register in issuer sponsored form, with a holding statement despatched to each former DI holder's registered address. To trade Shares in the future on the ASX, former DI holders will need to engage a broker or a nominee capable of settling on ASX (CHESS).\nDI holders who wish to withdraw their DIs from CREST and take receipt of Shares on the Australian share register, prior to the closure of the DI facility, should contact their broker without delay.\nThe Company advises DI holders to seek independent financial and tax advice regarding the AIM Cancellation and their Shares represented by DIs.\nExpected Timetable of Principal Events\nE\nvent\nTime and/or date\nAnnouncement of proposed AIM Cancellation\n15-Jan-26\nExpected last day of dealings in the Shares on AIM\n12-Feb-26\nExpected time and date of the AIM Cancellation\n7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13\nFebruary\n202\n6\nClosure of the DI Facility\n24-Feb-26\nFurther information\nInformation on the Cancellation and termination of depositary arrangements and the options available to DI holders, including how\nto withdraw from CREST and trade on ASX\n, will be sent to depositary interest holders from Computershare.

          "full_content": "15 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 9282O\nArtemis Resources Limited\n15 January 2026\n15 January 2026\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the UK version of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nArtemis Resources Limited\n(\"Artemis\" or \"the Company\")\nCancellation of Admission to AIM\nArtemis Resources Limited (ASX/AIM:ARV)\nannounces the cancellation of the admission of its ordinary shares (\"Shares\") to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAIM\n\") (the \"\nCancellation\n\") in accordance with Rule 41 of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nAIM Rules\n\"). It is expected that the Cancellation will occur on 13 February 2026. The Company's primary listing is on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"\nASX\n\") and it has been admitted to trading on AIM since 7 February 2022.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFollowing the Cancellation, the Company's Shares will remain listed on the ASX, which will continue as the primary trading venue for its equity securities. The Company has no intention to delist its Shares from the ASX.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is providing an opportunity for each Depositary Interest (\"\nDI\n\") holder to become a registered shareholder on the Company's Australian share register.\nReasons for the AIM Cancellation\nThe Company is of the view that the Company's admission to trading on AIM is not delivering sufficient value to shareholders, having regard to the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of maintaining admission to trading on AIM, including professional fees, listing fees payable and incremental legal, auditing and other fees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of management time and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's admission to trading on AIM, in addition to its ASX listing,\n\u00b7\nconditions which have impacted stock markets generally since its admission to trading on AIM in February 2022 have made it more challenging to raise capital in the UK; and\n\u00b7\nthe relatively low levels of liquidity and trading volumes in the Company's Shares on AIM.\nThe Board considers the Cancellation will not materially nor adversely impact existing Shareholders as they will still be able to trade on the ASX.\nProcess for Cancellation\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange to cancel admission of the Shares to trading on AIM, and it is expected that the Cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13 February 2026.\nOn the basis that the Company's Shares will continue to be listed on ASX, which is an AIM Designated Market (as defined by the AIM Rules), the Company is not required to seek shareholder approval for the Cancellation.\nThe full timetable of expected events is set out at the end of this announcement.\nPrincipal effects and risks relating to the Cancellation\n\u00b7\nThe Company's Shares will no longer be traded on AIM and the Company has no intention to implement a matched bargain facility to enable trading post Cancellation in the UK;\n\u00b7\nremaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX;\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory and financial reporting regime, including but not limited to, the AIM Rules, the corporate governance requirements for companies trading on AIM and UK MAR, will no longer apply, but the regulatory framework of the ASX, including its corporate governance requirements, and Australian company law will still apply;\n\u00b7\nshareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules, such as the requirement to be notified of certain events, including substantial transactions, financing transactions and related party transactions, and the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain transactions, where applicable, such as reverse takeovers and fundamental changes in the Company's business; albeit similar protection may be afforded pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules, Australian company law and the Australian Corporations Act;\n\u00b7\nZeus Capital Limited will cease to act as nominated adviser and UK broker to the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe Cancellation might have either positive or negative taxation consequences for shareholders. Stamp duty may be due on transfers of Shares and agreements to transfer Shares unless a relevant exemption or relief applies to a particular transfer. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional independent tax advisers.\nThe above considerations are non-exhaustive and shareholders should seek their own independent advice (including tax, financial and legal) when assessing the likely impact of the Cancellation on them.\nInformation for Depositary Interest (DI) holders\nThe Company's Shares will continue to be traded on AIM until market close, ",

Follow-up drilling starting next week\nArtemis Resources Limited (ASX/AIM: ARV) (\"Artemis\" or \"the Company\")\nis pleased to advise that independent mining consultant Snowden-Optrio is undertaking a conceptual mining study based on the Mineral Resource announced on 13 October 20221 which totals 374koz Au, 64kt Cu and 8kt Co. The study aims to unlock development optionality at Carlow at a time of materially stronger gold and copper prices. The planned outcomes will also help guide the extensional drilling program in the immediate area of the resource and provide drill core samples for metallurgical testwork.\nExtensional drilling will commence in December 2025, initially to follow-up a very encouraging gold intersection 600m east of the resource (\n7m at 2.9g/t Au\nin 25ARDD001 from 404m)2 then scope out potential for high-grade gold extensions in the Upper Zone (Refer Figure 1). Drilling is then planned to test the potential of the Lower Zone underlying the Carlow resource, where a historic drill hole intersected\n4m @ 11g/t Au and 2.0% Cu\nin hole 20CCDD003 from 639m downhole. This high-grade intersection below the resource has never been followed up.\nThe Snowden-Optrio conceptual mining study will also evaluate potential development options for the existing resource at Carlow to help inform the extensional drilling program commencing in December and current drilling of satellite gold targets near Carlow. The potential of the satellite targets is demonstrated by recent drilling at Titan East which produced a very high-\ngrade gold intersection (\n5m at 13.1g/t Au\nin 25ARRC006 from 132m)\n[4]\n- only 1.5km from Carlow. Final assay results are still awaited from recent RC drilling program at Titan.\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director, commented:\n\"The conceptual mining study is an important next step in advancing the Carlow project. We are very focused on unlocking the full potential of the Carlow project area given the very high-grade intercept at Titan East along with the increase in gold price. The mining study is part of multi-pronged approach with follow-up drilling at Titan due to start next week and extension drilling east of Carlow due to start in early December.\nImportantly, this work helps position Carlow for future development decisions, with higher gold and copper prices significantly improving project optionality and potential value creation for shareholders.\"\nUpcoming Milestones\n\u00b7\nNext Week:\nFollow-up RC drilling at Titan East\n\u00b7\nNovember-December 2025:\nMining study in progress\n\u00b7\nDecember 2025\n: Commence extensional drilling east of Carlow\n\u00b7\nQ1 2026:\nCommence extensional drilling below Carlow\n\u00b7\nQ1 2026:\nIntegration of drilling results into Carlow resource analysis(All subject to operational conditions and regulatory requirements)\nFigure 1\n: Schematic long section extending from Titan (west) to Carlow (east) showing an outline of the current Carlow resource announced on 13 October 2022, high grade gold intersections spread along 2.7km and proposed drilling targets in the Upper and Lower Zones along strike and below the Carlow resource.\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board\nArtemis Resources Ltd\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director\nJulian Hanna, Managing Director\nZeus (Nomad & Broker)\nAntonio Bossi / James Bavister /\nGabriella Zwarts\ninfo@artemisresources.com.au\nTel: +44 20 3829 5000\nCompetent Person Statement\nThe information in this report that relates to Exploration Results was compiled by Mr Julian Hanna, a Competent Person who is a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (",

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nArtemis Resources Limited\n(\"Artemis\" or \"The Company\")\nQuarterly Activities Report for the period ending 30 September 2025\nExcellent progress was made during the quarter by\nArtemis Resources Limited\n('\nArtemis\n' or the '\nCompany\n') (\nASX/AIM: ARV\n) during the early stages of the exploration and drilling campaign planned for the Karratha Gold-Copper Project and Cassowary Exploration Project.\nDrilling started at the Karratha Project on 23 September 2025 with an 18-hole reverse circulation ('RC') drilling program intended to test two shallow gold targets at the Titan gold prospect located 2-3km northwest of the Carlow gold copper resource\n[1]\n.\nThe RC drilling program consisted of widely spaced RC holes drilled across the Titan East target located within the structural zone which hosts Carlow, and the G1 gravity anomaly which includes small outcrops of brecciated and ferruginous chert with high grade gold occurrences from surface rock chip sampling, reported during 2024\n[2]\n.\nThe Titan RC drilling was very effective intersecting a range of favourable gold host rocks including chrome rich ultramafic units, chert, mafic volcanics and sediments with local zones of alteration, quartz veining and sulphides. No assay results were received before the end of the reporting period from drill samples sent for analysis from the Titan East and the G1 targets.\nPost the reporting period, assay results from one RC drill hole at Titan East were announced on 29 October 2025\n[3]\n. This announcement highlighted an intersection of\n5m @ 13.1g/t gold from 132m down hole\nin 25ARRC006 - the first hole to test an interpreted NE trending shear zone at Titan East. Based on the intersection in 25ARRC006, preparations are underway for diamond drilling in the December quarter to follow up these very encouraging early results.\nDiamond drilling will also be carried out along strike from an intersection of\n7m @ 2.9g/t Au in 25ARDD001\n600m east of the Carlow resource (refer to ARV announcement on 28 April 2025). Widely spaced drilling is planned to start in January 2026 to scope out potential for high-grade gold mineralisation between hole 25ARDD001 and the current limit of drilling at Carlow.\nExcellent progress was also made at the Cassowary Exploration Project during the quarter with the key 341km2 tenement (E69/4266) covering the large, interpreted Cassowary Intrusion granted on 11 August 2025. This was followed by lengthy negotiations for a Land Access Agreement covering all the Cassowary tenements (total area 1,129km2) which was executed by the Pila Nguru (Aboriginal Corporation) and announced on 13 October 2025.\nArtemis also completed a placement\n[4]\nfor a total $4.925m from institutional and sophisticated investors in Australia and United Kingdom, announced on 21 July 2025 and 24 September 2025. Funds raised are being used for exploration drilling programs and for early development studies at Carlow and to progress exploration at the Cassowary Project.\nKarratha Gold-Copper Project\nTitan Gold Targets\nTitan is a large, structurally complex area along the northern side of the Regal Thrust which outcrops as a prominent chert ridge (refer Figure 1). Titan is largely obscured by transported cover which limits the effectiveness of surface exploration, including soil geochemistry.\nDespite its proximity to Carlow and high-grade gold assays from surface samples of quartz veins and chert outcrops reported in 2024\n[5]\nonly three diamond holes were drilled at Titan prior to the RC drilling program which commenced in September. All three diamond holes drilled by Artemis at Titan East in March 2025 (25ARDD003, 25ARDD004 and 25ARDD005) reported elevated gold values (to 0.5g/t Au) including a\n1m assay of 16.4g/t Au\n[6]\n(refer Figures 1 and 2).\nFollowing heritage clearance received in July 2025, an 18-hole RC drilling program started in late September to test a 500m section of the Titan East target (10 holes) and the G1 gravity target (8 holes) - total meterage for the 18 holes drilled across both targets was 1,748m.\nLithologies intersected at Titan East and at the G1 Target in the recent RC drilling program include strongly sheared and altered ultramafic and mafic units, metasediments and chert. A 50m wide porphyry dyke was also intersected in the three previous diamond drill holes6.\nFigure 1:\nCarlow tenement with location of Titan Prospect within Regal Thrust Zone - showing chert outcrops (brown), major thrusts (black), area of March Quarter drilling at Titan East, and four interpreted gravity-high anomalies (G1",

There is no previous drilling along the shear zone.\n\u00b7\nThe high-grade gold intersection is associated with vein quartz within a 20m mineralised interval which includes other elevated gold assays between 0.1g/t Au up to 0.78g/t gold.\n\u00b7\nAssay results awaited from a second RC hole,\n25ARRC024,\ndrilled 50m east of 25ARRC006\nwhich intersected several intervals of vein quartz starting from 28m depth.\n\u00b7\nThe interpreted NE trending shear zone which hosts the gold intersected in 25ARRC006 is covered by transported sediments and is parallel to the Regal Thrust, which outcrops as a prominent chert ridge 300 metres to the south.\n\u00b7\nDiamond drilling is planned to start late November to determine orientation of the quartz veins and potential for extensions along the interpreted shear zone.\nArtemis Resources (ASX: ARV) (Artemis\nor\nthe Company\n) is pleased to report a high-grade gold intersection in the first RC hole testing an interpreted NE trending shear zone at the Titan East Prospect, 1.5km west of the Carlow gold-copper resource\n[1]\n.\nSignificant intersection - 25ARRC006 (all assays received):\n\u00b7\n5m @ 13.1 g/t Au from 132-137 m, including 3m @ 20.9 g/t Au from 133m.\n\u00b7\nThe high-grade gold intersection is associated with abundant vein quartz.\n\u00b7\nHigh-grade gold occurs within a 20m interval of elevated gold values from 131m.\nStep-out hole - 25ARRC024 (assays pending):\n\u00b7\nSeveral intervals of vein quartz identified between approximately 28m and 57m.\n\u00b7\nVein quartz occurs within altered and sheared ultramafic, mafic and sedimentary units.\n\u00b7\nHole 25ARRC024 also appears to have drilled through the interpreted shear zone.\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director, commented:\n\"Titan East is a brand-new, shear-hosted gold target just 1.5km from Carlow. Hitting 5m @ 13.1 g/t Au in the first RC hole is an excellent start and supports our strategy to build scale around Carlow by finding additional, nearby gold resources. Given the very encouraging gold intercept we have arranged for diamond drilling to begin in late November to define the true widths and orientation.\"\n\"While we await more assays from the RC drilling, these results have greatly increased our confidence in the potential at Titan and the wider Carlow area. Apart from the three diamond holes drilled in the March quarter which returned a very promising result of 1m @ 16.6g/t Au and the recent 18 RC drill holes, Titan is completely untested.\"\nTitan East\nTitan is a large, structurally complex area along the northern side of the Regal Thrust which outcrops as a regional chert ridge offset by NW-trending cross cutting faults. The central part of Titan is largely covered by transported cover which limits surface geochemical exploration.\nDuring September and early October, Artemis completed 18 widely spaced RC holes (1,758m) across two target areas at Titan. The targets tested by the RC drilling are Titan East, at the intersection of two major structural trends (refer to Figures 1 and 2) and the G1 gravity anomaly, 700m west of Titan East.\nPrevious March-quarter diamond drill holes (25ARDD003-005) and the recent RC drill holes intersected sheared and altered ultramafics, sediments, mafic volcanics and a porphyry sill. Assay results are pending for many of the recent RC holes at Titan including 25ARRC024 drilled 50m east of 25ARRC006. 25ARRC024 intersected several intervals with vein quartz between approximately 28m and 57m down hole within altered ultramafic, mafic units and sediments.\nA further update will be provided once all RC drill hole assays are received. (Refer Figures 1-3).\n.\nFigure 1: Simplified geology of Carlow area showing Regal Thrust Zone, Carlow resource outline and Titan East and G1 drill targets.

(Refer Figures 1 & 2).\nThe Proterozoic sequence hosting the target intrusions is buried below an estimated 250-300m of consolidated Eucla Basin sediments comprising limestone, sandstone and shale. Estimated thickness of the Eucla Basin sequence is based on 13 historic drill holes across the region which intersected basement at an average depth of 239m. Only two drill holes (BKD1, BKD2) located 28km southeast of Cassowary Intrusion have been drilled within the rift zone. (Refer Figure 2).\nThe rift zone sequence is expected to include metamorphosed sediments, mafic volcanics and intrusions based on sparse drilling across the wider Madura Province and geophysical data\n[1]\n. The interpreted intrusions appear to be associated with rift margins and cross cutting structures. Artemis recently increased its tenement area to around 1129km2 to cover additional targets within the interpreted rift zone, south of two applications by WA1 Resources Limited (\nWA1\n)\n[2]\n.\nCassowary Intrusion\nThe Cassowary Intrusion is a large, untested copper-gold exploration target located in a very favourable setting on the margin of a major crustal boundary.

Surface sampling at Titan and Thorpe prospects yielded exceptional gold and copper assays. These results were followed up with a Phase One drilling programme, targeting Marillion, Carlow East, and Titan. Drilling commenced in February 2025 and was successful in intersecting high grade gold in two areas, 600m east of the Carlow resource and at Titan, 2km west of the Carlow resource. The drilling also resulted in a new geological interpretation of the Carlow area which has opened potential for additional gold mineralisation along strike and below previous drilling and on previously untested shallow targets, notably at Titan where high grade gold occurrences were reported from sampling of widely spaced outcrops during 2024.\nEncouraged by these results we will in Q2 FY2026 undertake diamond drilling to scope out potential for significant extensions to the Carlow Mineral Resource which contains 374koz gold and 64,000t copper. At Titan we have commenced shallow low-cost RC drilling of geophysical anomalies in areas with high-grade surface gold occurrences and a brecciated host sequence near previous gold mineralisation encountered in the Phase One programme.\nIn addition to the Carlow Project, in December 2024 Artemis applied for a 340km2 exploration licence to cover a large, interpreted intrusion (Cassowary Intrusion) in a unique setting along a major crustal boundary, 450km east of Kalgoorlie. This licence was granted in August 2025. The Cassowary Intrusion is undrilled and has the potential to host intrusion related IOCG type copper/gold mineralisation and other types of intrusion hosted mineralisation. Post the reporting period, Artemis has expanded its holdings to over 1,000km2 to cover other interpreted intrusions at the Cassowary Project.\nWith the Cassowary Project showing significant early potential, the Company is seeking to sell or joint venture its Paterson project which tenement surrounds the Haverion 8moz Au deposit. We have also undertaken a number of studies during the year to determine how to extract maximum value from the Radio Hill processing plant.\nIn January 2025, we welcomed Julian Hanna as the Managing Director of Artemis. Julian was instrumental in bringing the Cassowary project to Artemis and in driving the exploration success we have achieved in the FY2025 year. I would like to thank fellow board members, the Artemis team in Perth and on site in Karratha and the Company's advisers for their ongoing contributions to the success of the Company.\nTo our shareholders, including existing and new shareholders who supported the capital raises in February and September 2025, we appreciate your confidence and commitment in Artemis which has allowed us to advance our valuable projects and plan for an exciting programme of exploration in the year ahead.\nMr Guy Robertson\nExecutive Chairman\n29 September 2025\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW\nREVIEW OF OPERATIONS\nArtemis Resources Limited ('Artemis\") is a gold, copper and lithium focused resource exploration company with projects in the West Pilbara, the Eucla Basin and the Central Paterson Region of Western Australia. The Company's assets include the Carlow Project Gold-Copper-Cobalt resource and Radio Hill processing plant (\"Radio Hill\") located within 35km radius of Karratha, and the Cassowary Copper/Gold Exploration Project located 450km east of Kalgoorlie.\nThe primary focus during the year was on gold exploration, notably on the 100% Carlow Tenement (E 47/1797-1).

Cassowary is 440km east of Kalgoorlie and accessable via the Trans rail line road, the Connie Sue 'Highway' and station tracks. (Refer Figure 1)\nProject Background\nThe Cassowary Project covers several undrilled interpreted intrusions within a 30-40km wide, previously undocumented, interpreted rift zone - below an estimated 250-300m of consolidated Eucla Basin sediments comprising limestone, sandstone and shale. (Refer Figure 2)\nThe estimated thickness of the Eucla Basin sequence is based on 13 historic holes drilled across the region which have an average depth of 239m to the Proterozoic basement. The interpreted rift zone is expected to include metamorphosed sediments, mafic volcanic units and intrusions based on sparse drilling across the Madura Province and available geophysical data\n[4]\n.\nThe interpreted intrusions may be related to rift margins and cross cutting structures. The Company recently increased its tenement area to around 990km2 to cover additional targets within the interpreted rift zone, south of two applications by WA1 Resources Limited (\nWA1\n)\n[5]\n.\nCassowary Intrusion\nThe interpreted Cassowary Intrusion is the highest priority target (T1) on E69/4266 with drilling likely to follow a detailed gravity survey to assist drill targeting. The Cassowary Intrusion\n[6]\n:\n\u00d8\nhas a large magnetic footprint (5-10kms in width)\n\u00d8\nis located on the contact of the Madura Crustal Boundary\n\u00d8\ncoincides with a cross-cutting NW-SE trending, 3-4km wide interpreted fault zone\n\u00d8\ninterpreted to have disrupted surrounding magnetic units by >20kms\n\u00d8\nmay\nrepresent a long-lived focus for magmatic activity\n\u00d8\nmay also\nrepresent a possible conduit for\nhydrothermal fluids\nJulian Hanna, Managing Director, commented:\n\"I am happy to report the Artemis team is very excited to have the Cassowary tenement granted which should enable field activities to get underway soon. The 7-month application period has been put to good use by Artemis Chief Geologist, Oliver Hirst. Oliver has made excellent progress in building our understanding of the unique potential of this area which we think has been overlooked by previous explorers and majors who have held tenements in the region.\nOnly two holes (BKD 1 and BKD 2) are recorded as having been drilled within the area shown in Figure 2. Both holes were drilled by Gunson Resources in 2009, with both reporting elevated copper in a Proterozoic mafic intrusion, 25km south-east of Cassowary.\nThe Cassowary Intrusion is a rare opportunity to explore the potential for large-scale IOCG type Copper/Gold deposits and other deposit types including Nickel/Copper/PGE (mafic intrusion type) and Gold (hydrothermal vein systems) in an area with effectively no prior drilling.\nWe look forward to reporting progress at Cassowary in the lead up to the ini",

Drilling is planned to start in August with summaries of the three projects below.\nPost the reporting period, Artemis successfully completed a placement\n[1]\nto fund the exploration and drilling and early development studies at Carlow. On 21 July 2025 the Company announced firm commitments to raise A$4.75 million from institutional and sophisticated investors with the placement strongly supported by new and existing investors in Australia and the United Kingdom.\nCarlow Gold/Copper Extension Drilling\nDuring the quarter the Company completed a review of more than 400 historic drill holes which formed the basis of the 2022 Carlow Mineral Resource estimate which contains\n374koz gold and 66,000t copper\n[2]\n.\nThe review focused on the potential of the high-grade gold and copper lodes within the wider resource with support provided by more than 190 assays >10.0g/t gold in 80 historic holes\nand more than 500 assays >2.0% copper in 162 historic holes\n[3]\n.\nPlanned drilling is intended to scope out the potential for significant extensions to the high-grade gold and copper lode system,\nwell beyond the current limit of drilling\n[4]\nand includes:\n\u00d8\nWidely spaced holes within a 600m gap along strike between the existing resource and an isolated intersection of:\n7m @ 2.9g/t Au, including 1m @ 15.3g/t Au\n[5]\n\u00d8\nWidely spaced holes to follow up an isolated historic intersection of:\n4m @ 11.1 g/t Au and 2.0% Cu 120m below the Carlow resource,\nwhich is open below 380m depth\n\u00d8\nDrilling at the Chapman/Thorpe prospect to test for repetitions of\nhigh-grade gold and copper lodes south of Carlow, below the flat lying Andover Intrusion\nA Project Manager will also be appointed\nto manage early development studies at Carlow in parallel with the extension drilling program. Studies will include including conceptual open pit and underground mining studies, metallurgical test work, and a review of processing options.\nFigure 1\n: Schematic longitudinal section extending 2.7km from recent drilling at Titan to a 7m @ 2.9g/t gold intersection 600m east of the Carlow Mineral Resource\n[6]\n- showing revised geological interpretation, resource outline including pierce points of drill holes with >10g/t Au and >2.0% Cu assays\n[7]\nand proposed drill holes (red diamonds)\nTitan Satellite Gold Targets\nDetailed geological mapping and data compilation of the extensive Titan prospect 2-3km west of Carlow was completed during the quarter. Despite its proximity to Carlow and high-grade gold values reported in 2024\n[8]\nfrom selective sampling by Artemis of quartz veins and brecciated chert from four small outcrops, only 3 holes have been drilled at Titan.\nFigure 2:\nTitan G1 Target - outcrop of brecciated and banded chert (approx. 5m wide) with thin stockwork iron oxide veining. Sample 24AR28-002 (above) from this outcrop returned\n51.8g/t Au\n3,11\n.\nNote\n: The grade of gold occurrences from selective samples of chert and quartz veins in outcrops at G1 and in the wider Titan Prospect area may be elevated due to surface enrichment. Drilling is required to provide an indication of gold grades below surface\nFigure 3:\nTitan Prospect within the Carlow Tenement - showing chert outcrops (brown), major thrusts (black) extending >7km across Carlow Tenement, area of March Q drilling at Titan, and 4 interpreted gravity-high anomalies (G1-G4).\nThree holes (\n25ARDD003, 25ARDD004, 25ARDD005)\nwere drilled along one traverse on the eastern side of Titan by Artemis\n[9]\nin February 2025. All holes intersected elevated gold intervals up to 0.5g/t Au in a previously untested sequence of strongly altered chrome-rich ultramafics and sediments. A\npeak value of\n1m @ 16.4g/t Au\nin hole 25ARDD004 from 67m down hole depth\n[10]\nwas intersected in a 50m wide porphyry dyke intruded into the sequence.\nThe next phase of drilling at Titan will comprise shallow, low-cost RC drill traverses to identify gold and related geochemical anomalies and provide geological data across wide areas with transported cover. A gravity survey was completed in June and\nconfirmed\n4 discrete gravity anomalies (G1-G4)\ninterpreted within the wide, structurally complex Regal Thrust zone.\nA heritage survey has also been completed\nfor drilling access in the western part of Titan\nincluding the G1 anomaly. While the outcome of the heritage survey is awaited,\nArtemis is targeting a start in late August and has contacted RC drilling contractors to test the following :\n\u00d8\nAlong strike from the previously untested ultramafic/sediment",

The first priority is widely spaced diamond drilling to scope out potential for significant extensions to the high-grade gold and copper lodes along strike and below the mineral resource announced in October 2022, and to provide core samples for metallurgical test work.\nA further strategy to build Carlow is using low-cost RC drilling to test the potential for shallow gold mineralisation at Titan, only 2km west of Carlow. RC drilling at Titan will initially test a near-circular\n~400m wide gravity anomaly (G1)\nwith small outcrops of\nbrecciated and sheared chert which returned assays up to 41.4g/t gold\n(sample ID: 24AR28-048 reported 28 January 2025) from surface samples of ferruginous chert\n[8]\n. RC drilling is also planned across the Titan thrust zone to test the wider potential of this unusual feature. A heritage survey to enable wider access for drilling at Titan is scheduled in July.\nThe Company's other outstanding exploration project is the interpreted\nCassowary Intrusion\nwhich occurs in a unique geological setting on the margin of a >500km long north-east trending crustal boundary, with surrounding geology disrupted over 10's of kms. Cassowary is a\nrare opportunity\nto drill for possible\nIOCG type copper/gold mineralisation\n. Artemis's 330km2 EL application which covers Cassowary is expected to be granted in September Quarter and planning is underway for a gravity survey to assist drill targeting.\nWe look forward to reporting progress on these three gold and copper opportunities as soon as possible\"\nCarlow Gold/Copper Project\nThe March quarter drilling program\n[9]\ncombined with detailed surface mapping and a hole-by-hole review of more than 400 historic holes at Carlow have resulted in a new interpretation of the geology and a better understanding of the potential for significant extensions to the high-grade gold/copper lode system at Carlow along strike and below the resource.",

During this period the Company completed the first phase of diamond drilling (Phase One) which was an initial test of three previously undrilled targets along a 2.7km long structural zone centred around the Carlow gold/copper deposit. Despite the proximity to the Carlow Mineral Resource announced in October 2022\n[8]\nwhich was based on >400 historic aircore, reverse circulation and diamond core drill holes, there is no effective drilling either east or west along strike from Carlow.\nThe targets were identified during a review of all available data which included high grade surface gold occurrences announced by Artemis during 2024\n[9]\n, geological and structural interpretations and detailed geological mapping of outcrops during the December 2024 quarter.\nPhase One comprised five diamond holes for a total of 1,790m as an initial test of the Marillion, Carlow East extensions and Titan targets which are plotted on Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n: Schematic longitudinal section extending from Marillion to Titan showing main interpreted geological features, an outline of the current Inferred Mineral Resource\n[10]\nat Carlow, pierce points of historic holes with many of the >10g/t Au and >2.0% Cu assays\n[11]\nprojected onto the section and drill traces (red) of all recent Phase One drill holes\nThe Phase One drilling program was successful with high-grade gold intersected at two of the targets, Marillion and Titan (Refer to figure 1).

Phase One comprised five diamond holes for a total of 1,790m with details of the targets included in Artemis announcements on\n10 February and 19 March 2025.\nWith the current gold price (~USD3,300/oz) approximately double the price when the Carlow Mineral Resource was announced in October 2022\n[2]\n(~USD1,640/oz), Artemis has commenced a review of >400 historic drill holes which formed the basis of the 2022 resource. Early results from this review are encouraging and some initial findings are summarised in this announcement.\nHighlights -\nPhase One Drilling\n\u00b7\n7m @ 2.9g/t Au including 1m @ 15.3g/t Au from 404m\nin 25ARDD001, the first hole to test the Marillion Prospect, 600m east of the Carlow resource\n\u00b7\nMarillion may be an extension of the Carlow gold/copper lode system\n,\nwith\nthe 600m gap between Carlow and Marillion now a high priority for drilling\n\u00b7\n1m @ 16.4g/t Au from 67m intersected at Titan,\nin hole 25ARDD004, 1.5km west of Carlow and on the same interpreted structure which hosts Carlow and Marillion\n\u00b7\nTitan intersection supported by elevated gold assays up to 0.5g/t Au\nwithin previously untested sequence intruded by porphyry with strong alteration, veining, brecciation\n\u00b7\nPhase One drilling generates new interpretation of Carlow geological setting\nopening up\nwider potential for\nmineralisation.

Importantly the first drill hole at the large Marillion target intersected\n7m @ 2.9g/t Au including 1m @ 15.3g/t Au\nfrom 399m downhole in 25ARDD001, approximately 600m east along strike from any previous drilling at Carlow. This one intersection suggests gold mineralisation may extend well beyond the current deposit with the gap between Carlow and Marillion now a high priority for drilling planned to start in the June quarter.\nThe potential for extensions to the Carlow deposit is also supported by an intersection of\n4m @ 11.1 g/t Au and 2.0% Cu\nin hole 20CCDD003, the deepest historic drill hole at Carlow\n[6]\n. This intersection is at approximately 500m vertical depth and is not included in the Carlow resource. The high-grade intersection in hole 20CCDD003 warrants step out drilling to test for other high-grade gold and copper lodes and potential resource extensions below Carlow.\nThe three recent holes at Titan were drilled below one of four surface gold occurrences in quartz veins and chert outcrops around a central gravity-low feature reported in 2024 and 2025\n[7]\n. The holes intersected ultramafic rocks and sediments intruded by porphyry with elevated values of gold\nup to 0.5g/t Au\nintersected in the ultramafic sequence and\n1m @ 16.4g/t Au\nintersected in the porphyry intrusion in hole 25ARDD004 from 67m down hole.\nThe first step in the Carlow review is to evaluate numerous (>700) high-grade gold and copper assays from historic drilling. High gold and copper grades are widespread across the Carlow lode system with assays greater than 10g/t gold and 2.0% copper listed in Tables 1-4 and plotted ",

Five holes for a total of 1,790m were drilled at the Titan prospect, the Marillion conductor and as an initial test of possible extensions down plunge from the Carlow deposit.\nThe drilling program was successful for several reasons. Firstly, it provided very encouraging early indications from the Titan prospect where high-grade surface gold occurrences1 were announced in 2024 from samples of quartz/ironstone veins and chert outcrops in four different areas at Titan. While we await assay results to confirm if gold has been intersected at Titan, wide zones of alteration, quartz veining and brecciation were reported in drill core from the three holes drilled to date.\nVisual observations of hydrothermal-type alteration and intensive veining at Titan are supported by systematic pXRF2 readings of drill core from the three Titan holes. pXRF readings\n2\ninclude highly elevated arsenic values (up to 3,460ppm arsenic)directly above the contact between an ultramafic sequence and an interprete",

The Company's assets include the Carlow Project Gold-Copper-Cobalt resource as well as the Radio Hill processing plant (\"Radio Hill\"), both located within 35km radius of Karratha.\nThe primary focus during the half year was on gold exploration, notably on the 100% Carlow Tenement (E\u00a047/1797-1) and on the Lulu Creek Gold Prospect located on E47/1746-1.\nFigure 1\n. Artemis Resources tenements\nKarratha Gold Project (ARV 100%)\nCarlow Tenement\nExploration activities during the half year within the Carlow Tenement consisted of detailed geological and structural mapping, geophysical interpretations and selective rock chip sampling of surface quartz veins and chert outcrops in the central part of the Carlow Tenement.\nA summary interpretation of the Carlow tenement which includes the central gravity low feature at the Titan Prospect, key elements of the regional structural interpretation and the location of high-grade gold results announced in 2024 from selected rock chip sampling of outcrops is shown in Figure 2. (\nNote:\nArtemis ASX announcements relating to gold samples referred to in this report are listed in the report).\nFigure\n2.\nGravity image of Carlow Tenement showing gravity-low feature at Titan with selected gold assays from surface rock chip samples. Shows outline of the Carlow resource and Marillion EM target within an interpreted 4km long northwest trending prospective zone, in red dash outline.\nIn addition, a review of approximately 410 historic drill holes drilled at the Carlow gold/copper deposit was conducted to evaluate the potential for high grade gold extensions along strike and below the current limit of drilling at the Carlow deposit.\nThis review concluded that potential extensions to the Carlow deposit may exist in the area between the eastern end of the Carlow drilling and the untested Marillion electro-magnetic (\"EM\") conductor. The Marillion EM conductor has been modelled as an approximate 500m long, sub-horizontal, south dipping conductive plate starting at ~350m vertical depth. The Marillion EM conductor is interpreted to be offset 300-500m from the Carlow deposit and has a conductive source estimated to be ~11,000 siemens. (Refer to Figure 3). Exploration work conducted during the period, provided the basis for substantial diamond drilling which commenced in early 2025.\nFigure 3\n. Carlow resource long section showing high grade gold intersections in the East zone and proposed diamond drill holes. Marillion EM conductor is projected south onto the Carlow section.\nIn late 2024, a review of all available data on the Carlow Tenement identified six high priority targets for drilling or further technical studies. Three of these targets were identified for drilling during the March 2025 quarter and were described in detail in an Artemis announcement dated 28 January 2025. The three targets to be drill tested in the March 2025 quarter are:\n\u00b7\nThe Marillion electro-magnetic (\"EM\") conductor located 500m east of the Carlow deposit, near the base of the overlying Andover Intrusion (Refer Figure 3)\n\u00b7\nDiamond drilling to test the potential for significant extensions to the Carlow deposit, down plunge from previous high-grade gold intersections (Refer Figure 3)\n\u00b7\nDrilling at the Titan East Prospect 2km northwest of Carlow, as an initial test of widespread high-grade gold occurrences at surface (Refer Figure 2)\nLulu Creek Gold Prospect - RC Drilling\nThe Lulu Creek Prospect is located 20km west of Carlow, on tenement E 47/1746. In late 2020 Artemis completed a shallow RC drilling program at Lulu Creek and intersected zones of anomalous gold mineralisation associated with disseminated sulphides at shallow depth. The best intersections included 1m @ 4.89g/t Au and 13.7g/t Ag from 24m depth and 2m @ 1.62g/t Au from 34m depth.\nOn 23 October 2024, Artemis announced commencement of an EIS co-funded RC drilling program at Lulu Creek to test potential for intrusion related gold deposits which could be related to IP anomalies interpreted below the area of shallow gold mineralisation intersected in 2020. 5 RC drill holes were completed in November 2024 and assay results from this program have been received.\nThe majority of assay results from ",

While we don't expect that the high gold grades seen in many of the surface samples will be indicative of grades that may be intersected in drilling below these samples, I think the results are very encouraging:\nFirstly, they demonstrate that potential still exists for significant gold discoveries within 2-3kms of our already substantial Carlow gold and copper deposit.

While we don't expect that the high gold grades seen in many of the surface samples will be indicative of grades that may be intersected in drilling below these samples, I think the results are very encouraging:\nFirstly, they demonstrate that potential still exists for significant gold discoveries within 2-3kms of our already substantial Carlow gold and copper deposit. Secondly, when combined with recent detailed geological mapping and structural interpretations, our geologists have been able to build a much clearer understanding of the geology and potential of this well mineralised area.

Despite proximity to Carlow, the targets planned to be drilled during the March Quarter are previously untested.\nSummary of Planned Activities - March Quarter 2025\n\u00b7\nThe first hole will test the large Marillion Electro-magnetic (\"EM\") conductor 500m east of the Carlow resource, near the base of the Andover Intrusion\n\u00b7\nDiamond drilling will then test the potential for significant extensions to the Carlow resource, down plunge from previous high-grade gold intersections\n\u00b7\nRC drilling is then planned across the Titan Prospect 2km northwest of Carlow, as an initial test of widespread high-grade gold occurrences at surface\n\u00b7\nRecent assays from outcrops of chert and quartz/ironstone veins at\nTitan\ninclude 51.8g/t Au and 41.4g/t Au\n,\u00a0in line with results announced during 2024\n\u00b7\nSurface gold occurrences at Titan may be associated with a large gravity-low feature surrounded by chert outcrops, interpreted major faults and thrusts\n\u00b7\nConceptual mining study planned to review the 2022 Carlow Inferred Mineral\nResource1\nincluding\n7.25Mt @ 1.3g/t gold for 296,000oz Au\nin an optimised pit\n\u00b7\nArtemis is also evaluating other quality assets and recently applied for an EL to cover an interpreted intrusion with potential for IOCG Cu/Au mineralisation\n\u00b7\nFollowing the recent $4M placement, the Company is now well funded to drill priority targets around Carlow and progress other promising gold targets\nNote 1\n: Refer to Artemis ASX announcement on 13 October 2022\nRecently appointed Managing Director Julian Hanna2 commented\n: '\nAs a result of the excellent work completed by the Karratha exploration team during 2024 and following the announced capital raising in December, Artemis is now in a strong position to undertake drilling of some exciting targets at the Karratha Gold Project.\nExploration in the following months will be focussed on the Carlow Tenement which hosts a significant gold - copper resource at Carlow and covers a wide range of exploration targets within a wide, prospective corridor with minimal previous drilling.\nI look forward to working closely with the very experienced and committed team at Artemis and updating shareholders with results from the drilling in due course.'\nNote 2\n: Refer to Artemis ASX announcement on 8 January 2025\nFigure 1\n. Artemis tenements in Pilbara region of Western Australia with Carlow Tenement hatched\nPriority Drill Targets and other Activities - March Quarter 2025\nMarillion Electro-Magnetic Anomaly3\nMarillion is a large, highly conductive electro-magnetic (FLTEM) anomaly modelled by the Company's consulting geophysicist as a 500m long, c.11,000 siemens conductor with the top at approximately 350m vertical depth (refer to Figure 2). Marillion is undrilled, and the source of the conductive anomaly is unknown.\nDrilling is planned to start in early February with the first drill hole designed to test the centre of the Marillion EM anomaly for possible sulphide hosted mineralisation.\nMarillion may potentially represent an extension of the Carlow gold/copper deposit offset >500m by a fault or represent a possible sulphide accumulation at the interpreted base of the Andover Intrusion which is mapped in outcrop near Marillion.\nNote 3\n: Refer to Artemis ASX announcement on 14 November 2022\nCarlow Mineral Resource4 - Potential Extensions\nThe Carlow deposit comprises a total\nInferred Mineral Resource of\n8.74Mt @ 1.3 g/t Au (374,000oz gold), 0.73% Cu (64,000t copper) and 0.09% Co (8,000t cobalt)\nThe majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource at Carlow occurs in\nWest Zone\n(within 3-4 stacked quartz/sulphide lodes) and\nEast Zone\n(within 1-2 quartz/sulphide lodes).\nAn internal review of all drill holes at Carlow concluded the eastern end of the East Zone is probably truncated by a fault which extends from surface to approximately 200m depth. From 200m to 500m depth, high-grade gold zones within the East Zone plunge east and may extend beyond the current limit of drilling\n(refer to Figure 2)\n.\nTwo widely spaced (>100m spaced) diamond drill holes are planned in the March quarter (Phase 1) to scope out potential for significant extensions to the Carlo",

The program is an immediate follow-up to December quarter drilling that identified a coherent gold-bearing shear zone beneath shallow cover.\nFigure 1 -\nDiamond drilling underway at Titan East.\nArtemis Executive Director, Jozsef Patarica, commented:\n\"Titan East has moved quickly from a conceptual target under shallow cover to an emerging gold zone with genuine scale potential. The commencement of diamond drilling is the next step in tightening our geological understanding of the shear zone and positioning Artemis to execute a larger, targeted follow-up program. With Titan East only 1.5 kilometres from Carlow, success here has a clear pathway to near-term value creation.\"\nDiamond Drill Program - Titan East\nThe Titan East diamond drilling program will comprise two\nholes for approximately 450 metres\n, targeting the interpreted\nnorth-east trending shear zone\nthat hosts the recent gold intersections.\nKey objectives include:\n\u00b7\nStructural definition\n: obtain oriented core (where applicable) to confirm shear orientation, controls on mineralisation, and vein/alteration architecture.\n\u00b7\nContinuity testing:\nstep-out drilling to assess the extent of mineralisation along strike and down-dip from the discovery area.\n\u00b7\nSampling:\ngenerate high-quality core for detailed logging, structural measurements and representative assay sampling.\nFigure 2\n- Titan East location plan (Carlow-Titan Project).\nFigure 3\n- Planned diamond drill collars and interpreted Titan East shear zone.\nBackground - Titan East Discovery Context\nDecember quarter RC drilling at Titan East confirmed a previously untested mineralised structure beneath shallow cover, including a high-grade intercept in 25ARRC006\n[4]\nand a subsequent discovery intersection in 25ARRC025\n[5]\n.

Since ABRN  or whatever their stupid name is that bought them out they have come down unreasonable hard on regulation. But it\u2019s an excuse to get their insurance cost down. But before that they gave other excuse.  example I had TIR and they stopped any further buying. Citing that the stock had been ramped on social media, telegram, I don\u2019t use as it\u2019s unsavoury. The stock gradually collapsed due to less liquidity. I pointed out that it\u2019s my money, I had signed disclaimers when I joined ii. Also that any shorters can now just ramp stocks and then you will do the rest for them! Before they stopped the buying completely, you had to ring them to answer questions. I said this amounted to advice because you were advising not to buy. Anyway I sent them the regulations they sent me their T&C\u2019s which said basically we can do what the fk we want! They then prevented trading in lots of other stocks forcing folk to sell - not good for UK plc!. They just want you to buy big uk and a selection of US. Every US stock I have wanted to buy I can\u2019t on ii. Some multi bagged now! I believe IG is better that\u2019s for my next ISA. https://open.substack.com/pub/thatstocksguy/p/if-you-turn-off-the-buy-button?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web GL Trek",

That way your holdings are left exactly the same, no tax implications (or fees you'd get for a sale/buyback), they just land with the new broker.

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through. However the majority will be forced sellers, hence the price crater we saw. I wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole now, but hopefully the transfer across to ASX will go well for LTH's.

So how many data centres are being built globally?   Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each)  add up to around  6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap...  But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply.   What  about everything else?    EV - is the biggest rising demand ,  extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand -  in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.",

Since ABRN  or whatever their stupid name is that bought them out they have come down unreasonable hard on regulation. But it\u2019s an excuse to get their insurance cost down. But before that they gave other excuse.  example I had TIR and they stopped any further buying. Citing that the stock had been ramped on social media, telegram, I don\u2019t use as it\u2019s unsavoury. The stock gradually collapsed due to less liquidity. I pointed out that it\u2019s my money, I had signed disclaimers when I joined ii. Also that any shorters can now just ramp stocks and then you will do the rest for them! Before they stopped the buying completely, you had to ring them to answer questions. I said this amounted to advice because you were advising not to buy. Anyway I sent them the regulations they sent me their T&C\u2019s which said basically we can do what the fk we want! They then prevented trading in lots of other stocks forcing folk to sell - not good for UK plc!. They just want you to buy big uk and a selection of US. Every US stock I have wanted to buy I can\u2019t on ii. Some multi bagged now! I believe IG is better that\u2019s for my next ISA. https://open.substack.com/pub/thatstocksguy/p/if-you-turn-off-the-buy-button?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web GL Trek",

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through. However the majority will be forced sellers, hence the price crater we saw. I wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole now, but hopefully the transfer across to ASX will go well for LTH's.

So how many data centres are being built globally?   Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each)  add up to around  6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap...  But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply.   What  about everything else?    EV - is the biggest rising demand ,  extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand -  in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.",

Since ABRN  or whatever their stupid name is that bought them out they have come down unreasonable hard on regulation. But it\u2019s an excuse to get their insurance cost down. But before that they gave other excuse.  example I had TIR and they stopped any further buying. Citing that the stock had been ramped on social media, telegram, I don\u2019t use as it\u2019s unsavoury. The stock gradually collapsed due to less liquidity. I pointed out that it\u2019s my money, I had signed disclaimers when I joined ii. Also that any shorters can now just ramp stocks and then you will do the rest for them! Before they stopped the buying completely, you had to ring them to answer questions. I said this amounted to advice because you were advising not to buy. Anyway I sent them the regulations they sent me their T&C\u2019s which said basically we can do what the fk we want! They then prevented trading in lots of other stocks forcing folk to sell - not good for UK plc!. They just want you to buy big uk and a selection of US. Every US stock I have wanted to buy I can\u2019t on ii. Some multi bagged now! I believe IG is better that\u2019s for my next ISA. https://open.substack.com/pub/thatstocksguy/p/if-you-turn-off-the-buy-button?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web GL Trek",

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through. However the majority will be forced sellers, hence the price crater we saw. I wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole now, but hopefully the transfer across to ASX will go well for LTH's.

The shares will continue to show in your Hargreaves Lansdown portfolio, but as the underlying custodian will be HSBC, or a sub-custodian of HSBC, there will be certain implications you should be aware of: We\u2019ll only allow sale instructions to be processed and all purchase requests will be rejected. You\u2019ll be able to sell your shares on the Australian Securities Exchange once they have been successfully transferred into our HSBC Australian Account. This process is likely to take a number of weeks to complete, although we\u2019ll work to ensure the transfer is concluded as quickly as possible. Please note that this is just an estimated timeframe and so, depending on the nature of the transfer it may take longer than usual to complete in some cases. We\u2019ll contact you again once the transfer is complete. You\u2019ll only be able to sell your shares over the phone by calling our Dealers on 0117 980 9800. Your order will be left to sell \u2018at best\u2019 during Australian Market hours. These trades are carried out by our overseas counterparty. The proceeds will be converted into Sterling, subject to the prevailing exchange rate at that time. Full details of our overseas dealing service are available at here. The following three charges will be applied to a sale: Our telephone commission of 1% of the consideration, subject to a minimum of \u00a320 and a maximum of \u00a350. Our overseas counterparty will charge commission of 0.35% of the overall deal, subject to a minimum of AUD200.00, which is currently approximately \u00a3101. HSBC will also charge a transaction fee of \u00a315 per sale. The shares will be held with our third-party custodian, HSBC, who may in turn hold the shares through a sub-custodian in the home country of the investment. The settlement, legal or regulatory requirements that apply to the shares may differ from those applicable in the UK. Your investment may not benefit from the same protections in the event of the insolvency of the third party that may apply under UK law. A more detailed explanation of these additional risks is provided in section A25 of our terms & conditions, which are available at hl.co.uk/terms-and-conditions.",

That way your holdings are left exactly the same, no tax implications (or fees you'd get for a sale/buyback), they just land with the new broker.

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through. However the majority will be forced sellers, hence the price crater we saw. I wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole now, but hopefully the transfer across to ASX will go well for LTH's.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nQuarterly Activities Report\nFor the period ending 31 December 2025\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nArtemis Resources Limited ('\nArtemis'\nor the\n'Company\n') (\nASX:\nARV\n) is pleased to provide its Quarterly Activities Report for the period ended 31 December 2025 (the quarter).\nDuring the quarter, the Company delivered a significant exploration breakthrough at the Titan East prospect within the Karratha Gold-Copper Project, advanced development studies at Carlow, and expanded its copper growth pipeline through the execution of a new earn-in and joint venture agreement in the Madura Province. Artemis also entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to collaboratively assess processing options for the Elizabeth Hill Silver mine and positioned its technical team for drilling programs scheduled in early 2026.\nQuarter Highlights (December 2025)\n\u00b7\nTitan East discovery breakthrough:\nConfirmation of a new shear-hosted gold system with high-grade results of\n5m @ 13.1g/t Au\n(25ARRC006) and\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au\n(25ARRC025), supporting an emerging mineralised trend over approximately\n600m strike\nand triggering follow-up diamond drilling\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025 and 19 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nCarlow development studies initiated:\nCommencement of a conceptual mining study to assess potential open pit and underground development scenarios in parallel with planned extensional drilling\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 17 November 2025).\n\u00b7\nMadura Province expansion:\nExecution of an earn-in and joint venture agreement with Red Metal Limited to earn up to\n60% of the Sharon Dam IOCG Project\n, establishing a second district-scale copper growth opportunity alongside Cassowary\n(refer to ASX announcements dated 24 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nRadio Hill optionality advanced:\nSigning of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with West Coast Silver to assess the suitability of the Radio Hill Processing Plant for potential toll treatment opportunities\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 4 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nPost-quarter corporate update:\nJulian Hanna transitioned from Technical Director to Project Manager (Cassowary and Sharon Dam) under a consultancy agreement effective 1 January 2026 (refer to ASX announcement dated 31 December 2025). Artemis announced its intention to delist from the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange, with the objective of reducing costs and compliance overheads\u00a0and consolidating trading liquidity on ASX\u00a0(refer ASX announcement dated 15 January 2025).\nKarratha Gold-Copper Project\nTitan East Gold Discovery\nThe December quarter was headlined by a transition from exploration targeting to discovery at the Titan East prospect, located approximately 1.5km northwest of the Carlow Gold-Copper Resource\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025).\nAssay results from the first reverse circulation (RC) hole drilled to test a newly identified north-east trending shear zone returned a high-grade intersection of\n5m @ 13.1g/t Au from 132m\nin hole\n25ARRC006\n, representing the first drilling to test this interpreted structural position\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025).\nFollow-up drilling confirmed continuity of mineralisation along the shear zone, with hole\n25ARRC025\nintersecting\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au from 127m\n, supporting the presence of a coherent mineralised system,\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 19 December 2025)\n.\nGold mineralisation is associated with vein quartz and alteration within a structural zone parallel to the Regal Thrust, the same regional-scale structure that hosts the Carlow deposit. The Titan East area is largely obscured by transported sediments, which has historically limited the effectiveness of surface exploration and highlights the importance of drilling-led discovery.\nIn response to these results, Artemis commenced diamond drilling during the quarter to define the geometry, orientation and potential scale of the mineralised shear zone. Diamond hole\n25ARDD006\nwas collared on 10 December 2025, with early core observations confirming successful intersection of the targeted structure at depth. Assay results were pending at quarter end\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 19 December 2025).\nNext steps (March 2026 quarter):\n\u00b7\nCompletion and assay of diamond drilling\n\u00b7\nFollow-up diamond drilling to test strike and depth continuity\n\u00b7\nIntegration of results into the Carlow-Titan geological model\nCarlow Gold-Copper Project\nThe Carlow Gold-Copper Project remains a cornerstone asset withi",

The also never announced cut off dates on COIN placing meaning I missed a chance by 5 mins even though I had the funds cleared over two hours before. It was their self imposed deadline which was unpublished! Their written replies have mostly been poor and incomplete meaning one has to ask the same questions again. Their contract basically says they can do as they like! I asked them about ARV and after a period of time the reply was - see the announced corporate action which would answer the questions. As usual it didn\u2019t! I wanted to know if the stock could be held 1 for 1 in my ISA or did it have to be sold (worried about spread) and rebought in another account etc. They have indeed now replied saying that they can be held in the ISA on a 1 for 1 basis. But the trading fees are higher and sent a link. This could have been done before! It\u2019s also only just recently that you can reply on the same query thread. Beforehand you had to do a new one for every interaction. This time with ARV  ii have at least done better than many other platforms, beforehand they have fallen well short. If you want to hold basic blue chips, trusts etc it\u2019s fine but if you wish for more than that like trading more US shares or other markets, taking part in placings etc IG are better.

You\u2019ll be able to sell your shares on the Australian Securities Exchange once they have been successfully transferred into our HSBC Australian Account. This process is likely to take a number of weeks to complete, although we\u2019ll work to ensure the transfer is concluded as quickly as possible. Please note that this is just an estimated timeframe and so, depending on the nature of the transfer it may take longer than usual to complete in some cases. We\u2019ll contact you again once the transfer is complete. You\u2019ll only be able to sell your shares over the phone by calling our Dealers on 0117 980 9800. Your order will be left to sell \u2018at best\u2019 during Australian Market hours. These trades are carried out by our overseas counterparty. The proceeds will be converted into Sterling, subject to the prevailing exchange rate at that time. Full details of our overseas dealing service are available at here. The following three charges will be applied to a sale: Our telephone commission of 1% of the consideration, subject to a minimum of \u00a320 and a maximum of \u00a350. Our overseas counterparty will charge commission of 0.35% of the overall deal, subject to a minimum of AUD200.00, which is currently approximately \u00a3101. HSBC will also charge a transaction fee of \u00a315 per sale. The shares will be held with our third-party custodian, HSBC, who may in turn hold the shares through a sub-custodian in the home country of the investment. The settlement, legal or regulatory requirements that apply to the shares may differ from those applicable in the UK. Your investment may not benefit from the same protections in the event of the insolvency of the third party that may apply under UK law. A more detailed explanation of these additional risks is provided in section A25 of our terms & conditions, which are available at hl.co.uk/terms-and-conditions.",

Whether you can buy/sell every minute of the trading day is another matter but again, entirely down to how the likes of II/AJ Bell/HL etc choose to allow trading on the ASX. Just to be clear, you're not in any danger of losing your shares :)",

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through. However the majority will be forced sellers, hence the price crater we saw. I wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole now, but hopefully the transfer across to ASX will go well for LTH's.

The shares will continue to show in your Hargreaves Lansdown portfolio, but as the underlying custodian will be HSBC, or a sub-custodian of HSBC, there will be certain implications you should be aware of: We\u2019ll only allow sale instructions to be processed and all purchase requests will be rejected. You\u2019ll be able to sell your shares on the Australian Securities Exchange once they have been successfully transferred into our HSBC Australian Account. This process is likely to take a number of weeks to complete, although we\u2019ll work to ensure the transfer is concluded as quickly as possible. Please note that this is just an estimated timeframe and so, depending on the nature of the transfer it may take longer than usual to complete in some cases. We\u2019ll contact you again once the transfer is complete. You\u2019ll only be able to sell your shares over the phone by calling our Dealers on 0117 980 9800. Your order will be left to sell \u2018at best\u2019 during Australian Market hours. These trades are carried out by our overseas counterparty. The proceeds will be converted into Sterling, subject to the prevailing exchange rate at that time. Full details of our overseas dealing service are available at here. The following three charges will be applied to a sale: Our telephone commission of 1% of the consideration, subject to a minimum of \u00a320 and a maximum of \u00a350. Our overseas counterparty will charge commission of 0.35% of the overall deal, subject to a minimum of AUD200.00, which is currently approximately \u00a3101. HSBC will also charge a transaction fee of \u00a315 per sale. The shares will be held with our third-party custodian, HSBC, who may in turn hold the shares through a sub-custodian in the home country of the investment. The settlement, legal or regulatory requirements that apply to the shares may differ from those applicable in the UK. Your investment may not benefit from the same protections in the event of the insolvency of the third party that may apply under UK law. A more detailed explanation of these additional risks is provided in section A25 of our terms & conditions, which are available at hl.co.uk/terms-and-conditions.",

I've moved shares between providers countless times so might help to know it's a very simple process. What you want you request (with the new provider) is an 'in specie' transfer. That way your holdings are left exactly the same, no tax implications (or fees you'd get for a sale/buyback), they just land with the new broker. I'm expecting this to bounce quite nicely from here now news has been absorbed by the market. Absolutely nothing about the company has changed - only the trading venue.",

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through. However the majority will be forced sellers, hence the price crater we saw. I wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole now, but hopefully the transfer across to ASX will go well for LTH's.

As usual it didn\u2019t! I wanted to know if the stock could be held 1 for 1 in my ISA or did it have to be sold (worried about spread) and rebought in another account etc. They have indeed now replied saying that they can be held in the ISA on a 1 for 1 basis.

The also never announced cut off dates on COIN placing meaning I missed a chance by 5 mins even though I had the funds cleared over two hours before. It was their self imposed deadline which was unpublished! Their written replies have mostly been poor and incomplete meaning one has to ask the same questions again. Their contract basically says they can do as they like! I asked them about ARV and after a period of time the reply was - see the announced corporate action which would answer the questions. As usual it didn\u2019t! I wanted to know if the stock could be held 1 for 1 in my ISA or did it have to be sold (worried about spread) and rebought in another account etc. They have indeed now replied saying that they can be held in the ISA on a 1 for 1 basis. But the trading fees are higher and sent a link. This could have been done before! It\u2019s also only just recently that you can reply on the same query thread. Beforehand you had to do a new one for every interaction. This time with ARV  ii have at least done better than many other platforms, beforehand they have fallen well short. If you want to hold basic blue chips, trusts etc it\u2019s fine but if you wish for more than that like trading more US shares or other markets, taking part in placings etc IG are better. Ii only list a few common US shares and their customer service isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be when you step outside of \u2018mainstream\u2019. Usual caveats Trek",

The shares will continue to show in your Hargreaves Lansdown portfolio, but as the underlying custodian will be HSBC, or a sub-custodian of HSBC, there will be certain implications you should be aware of: We\u2019ll only allow sale instructions to be processed and all purchase requests will be rejected. You\u2019ll be able to sell your shares on the Australian Securities Exchange once they have been successfully transferred into our HSBC Australian Account. This process is likely to take a number of weeks to complete, although we\u2019ll work to ensure the transfer is concluded as quickly as possible. Please note that this is just an estimated timeframe and so, depending on the nature of the transfer it may take longer than usual to complete in some cases. We\u2019ll contact you again once the transfer is complete. You\u2019ll only be able to sell your shares over the phone by calling our Dealers on 0117 980 9800. Your order will be left to sell \u2018at best\u2019 during Australian Market hours. These trades are carried out by our overseas counterparty. The proceeds will be converted into Sterling, subject to the prevailing exchange rate at that time. Full details of our overseas dealing service are available at here. The following three charges will be applied to a sale: Our telephone commission of 1% of the consideration, subject to a minimum of \u00a320 and a maximum of \u00a350. Our overseas counterparty will charge commission of 0.35% of the overall deal, subject to a minimum of AUD200.00, which is currently approximately \u00a3101. HSBC will also charge a transaction fee of \u00a315 per sale. The shares will be held with our third-party custodian, HSBC, who may in turn hold the shares through a sub-custodian in the home country of the investment. The settlement, legal or regulatory requirements that apply to the shares may differ from those applicable in the UK. Your investment may not benefit from the same protections in the event of the insolvency of the third party that may apply under UK law. A more detailed explanation of these additional risks is provided in section A25 of our terms & conditions, which are available at hl.co.uk/terms-and-conditions.",

That way your holdings are left exactly the same, no tax implications (or fees you'd get for a sale/buyback), they just land with the new broker.

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through.

The shares will continue to show in your Hargreaves Lansdown portfolio, but as the underlying custodian will be HSBC, or a sub-custodian of HSBC, there will be certain implications you should be aware of: We\u2019ll only allow sale instructions to be processed and all purchase requests will be rejected. You\u2019ll be able to sell your shares on the Australian Securities Exchange once they have been successfully transferred into our HSBC Australian Account. This process is likely to take a number of weeks to complete, although we\u2019ll work to ensure the transfer is concluded as quickly as possible. Please note that this is just an estimated timeframe and so, depending on the nature of the transfer it may take longer than usual to complete in some cases. We\u2019ll contact you again once the transfer is complete. You\u2019ll only be able to sell your shares over the phone by calling our Dealers on 0117 980 9800. Your order will be left to sell \u2018at best\u2019 during Australian Market hours. These trades are carried out by our overseas counterparty. The proceeds will be converted into Sterling, subject to the prevailing exchange rate at that time. Full details of our overseas dealing service are available at here. The following three charges will be applied to a sale: Our telephone commission of 1% of the consideration, subject to a minimum of \u00a320 and a maximum of \u00a350. Our overseas counterparty will charge commission of 0.35% of the overall deal, subject to a minimum of AUD200.00, which is currently approximately \u00a3101. HSBC will also charge a transaction fee of \u00a315 per sale. The shares will be held with our third-party custodian, HSBC, who may in turn hold the shares through a sub-custodian in the home country of the investment. The settlement, legal or regulatory requirements that apply to the shares may differ from those applicable in the UK. Your investment may not benefit from the same protections in the event of the insolvency of the third party that may apply under UK law. A more detailed explanation of these additional risks is provided in section A25 of our terms & conditions, which are available at hl.co.uk/terms-and-conditions.",

Many of our major brokers offering ISA's do not support ASX, so if you acted quickly on the news and found a broker that could accept the shares, you had a small window to transfer them across before the deadline and pocket the price difference when it goes through. However the majority will be forced sellers, hence the price crater we saw. I wouldn't touch this company with a barge pole now, but hopefully the transfer across to ASX will go well for LTH's.

      "rns_narrative": [
        "The first beat of the story is the company\u2019s failure to secure admission to the AIM market in mid\u2011January 2026, a move that effectively halted any trading activity and left investors without a liquid exit route.  This announcement was followed by a formal delisting notice, signalling that the company is no longer listed on any regulated exchange and that any trades would have to occur on the over\u2011the\u2011counter market, if at all.  The loss of a listing is a major red flag for any micro\u2011cap, as it removes regulatory oversight and investor protection mechanisms.",
        "A second narrative thread revolves around the company\u2019s exploration ambitions, highlighted by a series of updates on the Titan East project.  In January the company announced the recommencement of diamond drilling, a technical milestone that could validate the presence of valuable ore.  Earlier in December, a new joint\u2011venture agreement was signed to share the costs and risks of the exploration programme, while a replacement discovery was reported, suggesting that the team had found a new target area within the same district.  These announcements create a faint sense of potential upside, but they lack any concrete production or revenue data.",
        "Corporate governance has seen a handful of changes, with a director retiring in November and a new project manager appointed at the end of December.  The AGM held on 27\u202fNovember 2025 confirmed the board\u2019s decision to pursue the Titan East drilling programme and outlined a tentative capital\u2011raising plan, but did not disclose any new funding commitments.  The board update in December reiterated the company\u2019s focus on cost\u2011efficient exploration, while the corporate presentation in November outlined the strategic roadmap for the next 12 months.",
        "Financial reporting remains sparse.  The quarterly activities report issued on 30\u202fJanuary 2026 detailed the company\u2019s capital expenditure on drilling rigs and laboratory analysis, but did not provide any figures on cash burn or reserves.  The absence of a profit\u2011and\u2011loss statement, balance sheet or cash\u2011flow statement makes it difficult for investors to gauge the company\u2019s financial health or its ability to sustain operations until a commercial outcome is achieved.",
        "The risk profile is essentially a zero\u2011value scenario.  With an average true range of 0.0000 and a 20\u2011day standard deviation of 0.0000, the stock exhibits no price movement whatsoever.  The lack of trading volume, combined with a Google Trends score of 0/100 and zero social media posts, indicates that the market is essentially ignoring the company.  This lack of attention is a strong indicator that the story has lost its oxygen and is unlikely to attract any new capital or interest.",
        "Taken together, the narrative paints a picture of a company that has lost its listing, has not produced any revenue, and has no visible path to profitability.  The exploration updates are the only potential catalysts, but they are technical milestones without any immediate financial impact.  The risk profile, combined with the absence of trading activity and market sentiment, suggests that the company\u2019s shares are effectively a speculative lottery with very low probability of payoff."

      "bear_case": "The bear case is strong: the company is delisted, has zero trading activity, no revenue, and no clear path to profitability.  The risk of further dilution or a complete wipe\u2011out of equity is high, and the likelihood of a turnaround is extremely low.",
      "risk_reward": "Risk/reward is poor\u2014there is no upside without a new catalyst, while the downside is essentially a 100% loss of the invested capital."

      "if_watching": "Wait for a credible funding round or a significant technical result before committing.  If a new partnership is announced, consider a small position on a dip, but remain cautious about liquidity.",
      "if_passing": "Given the lack of trading, the absence of any revenue or clear catalyst, and the zero market interest, it is prudent to pass.  The story is effectively dead, and there is no realistic path to a profitable exit."
    },
    "bottom_line": "Pass\u2014Artemis Resources is a dead story with no trading activity, no revenue, and a lack of catalysts.  The risk of a 100% loss outweighs any speculative upside.",
