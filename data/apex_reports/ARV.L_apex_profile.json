The program is an immediate follow-up to December quarter drilling that identified a coherent gold-bearing shear zone beneath shallow cover.\nFigure 1 -\nDiamond drilling underway at Titan East.\nArtemis Executive Director, Jozsef Patarica, commented:\n\"Titan East has moved quickly from a conceptual target under shallow cover to an emerging gold zone with genuine scale potential. The commencement of diamond drilling is the next step in tightening our geological understanding of the shear zone and positioning Artemis to execute a larger, targeted follow-up program. With Titan East only 1.5 kilometres from Carlow, success here has a clear pathway to near-term value creation.\"\nDiamond Drill Program - Titan East\nThe Titan East diamond drilling program will comprise two\nholes for approximately 450 metres\n, targeting the interpreted\nnorth-east trending shear zone\nthat hosts the recent gold intersections.\nKey objectives include:\n\u00b7\nStructural definition\n: obtain oriented core (where applicable) to confirm shear orientation, controls on mineralisation, and vein/alteration architecture.\n\u00b7\nContinuity testing:\nstep-out drilling to assess the extent of mineralisation along strike and down-dip from the discovery area.\n\u00b7\nSampling:\ngenerate high-quality core for detailed logging, structural measurements and representative assay sampling.\nFigure 2\n- Titan East location plan (Carlow-Titan Project).\nFigure 3\n- Planned diamond drill collars and interpreted Titan East shear zone.\nBackground - Titan East Discovery Context\nDecember quarter RC drilling at Titan East confirmed a previously untested mineralised structure beneath shallow cover, including a high-grade intercept in 25ARRC006\n[4]\nand a subsequent discovery intersection in 25ARRC025\n[5]\n. Artemis also completed a diamond hole in December to support geological interpretation, with further assays pending. These results are expected to underpin a substantial follow-up drilling campaign in early 2026.\nThis ASX announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Artemis Resources Limited.\nArtemis Resources Ltd\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director\nZeus (Nomad and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi / James Bavister\ninfo@artemisresources.com.au\nTel: + 44 20 3829 5000\nAbout Artemis Resources\nArtemis Resources (ASX/AIM: ARV)\nis an exploration company advancing a highly prospective portfolio of gold, copper and critical minerals projects in Western Australia.\nIn the underexplored North Pilbara province, Artemis holds the Carlow Gold-Copper Project and the Titan and Thorpe prospects.

The Company's primary listing is on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"\nASX\n\") and it has been admitted to trading on AIM since 7 February 2022.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFollowing the Cancellation, the Company's Shares will remain listed on the ASX, which will continue as the primary trading venue for its equity securities. The Company has no intention to delist its Shares from the ASX.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is providing an opportunity for each Depositary Interest (\"\nDI\n\") holder to become a registered shareholder on the Company's Australian share register.\nReasons for the AIM Cancellation\nThe Company is of the view that the Company's admission to trading on AIM is not delivering sufficient value to shareholders, having regard to the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of maintaining admission to trading on AIM, including professional fees, listing fees payable and incremental legal, auditing and other fees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of management time and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's admission to trading on AIM, in addition to its ASX listing,\n\u00b7\nconditions which have impacted stock markets generally since its admission to trading on AIM in February 2022 have made it more challenging to raise capital in the UK; and\n\u00b7\nthe relatively low levels of liquidity and trading volumes in the Company's Shares on AIM.\nThe Board considers the Cancellation will not materially nor adversely impact existing Shareholders as they will still be able to trade on the ASX.\nProcess for Cancellation\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange to cancel admission of the Shares to trading on AIM, and it is expected that the Cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13 February 2026.\nOn the basis that the Company's Shares will continue to be listed on ASX, which is an AIM Designated Market (as defined by the AIM Rules), the Company is not required to seek shareholder approval for the Cancellation.\nThe full timetable of expected events is set out at the end of this announcement.\nPrincipal effects and risks relating to the Cancellation\n\u00b7\nThe Company's Shares will no longer be traded on AIM and the Company has no intention to implement a matched bargain facility to enable trading post Cancellation in the UK;\n\u00b7\nremaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX;\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory and financial reporting regime, including but not limited to, the AIM Rules, the corporate governance requirements for companies trading on AIM and UK MAR, will no longer apply, but the regulatory framework of the ASX, including its corporate governance requirements, and Australian company law will still apply;\n\u00b7\nshareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules, such as the requirement to be notified of certain events, including substantial transactions, financing transactions and related party transactions, and the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain transactions, where applicable, such as reverse takeovers and fundamental changes in the Company's business; albeit similar protection may be afforded pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules, Australian company law and the Australian Corporations Act;\n\u00b7\nZeus Capital Limited will cease to act as nominated adviser and UK broker to the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe Cancellation might have either positive or negative taxation consequences for shareholders. Stamp duty may be due on transfers of Shares and agreements to transfer Shares unless a relevant exemption or relief applies to a particular transfer. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional independent tax advisers.\nThe above considerations are non-exhaustive and shareholders should seek their own independent advice (including tax, financial and legal) when assessing the likely impact of the Cancellation on them.\nInformation for Depositary Interest (DI) holders\nThe Company's Shares will continue to be traded on AIM until market close, being 4.30 p.m. London time, on 12 February 2026 after which, there will be no public market in the UK on which the Shares can be traded. In addition to the delisting, the Company will also be terminating the Depositary Interest service. After the closure of the DI facility on 24 February 2026, all remaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register (being Automic Pty Ltd) and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX. These Shares will be held on the Australian share register in issuer sponsored form, with a holding statement despatched to each former DI holder's registered address. To trade Shares in the future on the ASX, former DI holders will need to engage a broker or a nominee capable of settling on ASX (CHESS).\nDI holders who wish to withdraw their DIs from CREST and take receipt of Shares on the Australian share register, prior to the closure of the DI facility, should contact their broker without delay.\nThe Company advises DI holders to seek independent financial and tax advice regarding the AIM Cancellation and their Shares represented by DIs.\nExpected Timetable of Principal Events\nE\nvent\nTime and/or date\nAnnouncement of proposed AIM Cancellation\n15-Jan-26\nExpected last day of dealings in the Shares on AIM\n12-Feb-26\nExpected time and date of the AIM Cancellation\n7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13\nFebruary\n202\n6\nClosure of the DI Facility\n24-Feb-26\nFurther information\nInformation on the Cancellation and termination of depositary arrangements and the options available to DI holders, including how\nto withdraw from CREST and trade on ASX\n, will be sent to depositary interest holders from Computershare.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n22 December 2025\nArtemis Expands Footprint in High Leverage Copper Frontier\nEarn-In/Joint Venture Agreement with Red Metal at Sharon Dam IOCG Target\n50km south of the Cassowary Intrusion within Madura Copper Exploration Belt\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nHigh-leverage copper JV:\nArtemis can earn 60%\u00a0of Red Metal's Sharon Dam IOCG target by spending not less than $5,000,000 within 3 years, inclusive of an initial commitment $400k for drilling, supported by~$220k\u00a0government EIS co-funding grant\n\u00b7\nOptionality:\nAfter meeting the $400k commitment for drilling within 12 months, Artemis has the option to continue and earn the JV interest or withdraw from the agreement at any time.\n\u00b7\nBelt-scale potential:\nSharon Dam is a large previously undrilled IOCG target\u00a0defined by a strong coincident magnetic-gravity anomaly\u00a0within a frontier copper exploration district\n\u00b7\nStrategic consolidation\n:\u00a0JV strengthens Artemis' 1,180km\u00b2 copper-gold position\u00a0along the Madura Crustal Boundary, an emerging province with multiple interpreted intrusions.\n\u00b7\nFavourable discovery conditions:\nShallow cover (estimated 250m)\u00a0provides a cost-effective exploration environment compared to deeper IOCG systems elsewhere in Australia.\n\u00b7\nRapid pathway to drilling:\nGranted tenement; established access to drill site; existing heritage agreement with drilling targeted for March-April 2026, subject to heritage clearance.\nArtemis Resources Limited (ASX/AIM: ARV)\n(\nArtemis\nor\nthe Company\n) is pleased to advise that it has entered into an earn-in and joint venture agreement with Red Metal Limited (ASX: RDM) (\nRed Metal\n) over the highly prospective Sharon Dam T1 intrusion, located approximately 50km south\u00a0of the Company's compelling Cassowary Intrusion\u00a0in Western Australia's Madura Province.\nThe JV expands Artemis' holdings and provides a second outstanding target (after Cassowary) for early drilling within what is interpreted to be a unique, multi-intrusion belt\u00a0within a wide rift zone along the Madura Crustal Boundary (\nMCB\n)\u00a0- a major structural corridor and one of the last underexplored frontiers for IOCG copper and other intrusion related deposits in Australia.\nArtemis Executive Director, Jozsef Patarica, commented:\n\"The JV with Red Metal provides a strategic and low-cost entry into another compelling IOCG target in Western Australia. By partnering with Red Metal we are expanding our footprint 50 kilometres south of the Cassowary Intrusion and putting funds directly into drilling one of the most exciting targets in the region. The Sharon Dam target sits within an area which may host multiple intrusions adjacent to the Madura Crustal Boundary - which we believe is on the cusp of major exploration interest. Consolidation of this belt enhances Artemis' position as a leading copper explorer in a region with IOCG potential.\"\nArtemis Technical Director, Julian Hanna, added:\n\"Sharon Dam is a rare opportunity for Artemis. Not only does it tick all the boxes on technical grounds, the first drill hole into the centre of this compelling target will be co-funded by a substantial EIS grant reducing the funding requirement from Artemis. Our exploration team is looking forward to working closely with Red Metal on the Sharon Dam project, and with the Pila Nguru Native Title Holders and local station owners on the wider Cassowary Project which extends 70km along this overlooked belt.\"\nFrontier IOCG Search Space: Madura Crustal Boundary -\nExceptional Geological Opportunity\nRecent interpretations of geophysical data by Artemis have identified a >30km-wide rift zone\u00a0which appears to host multiple interpreted intrusions\u00a0- dominated in the north by the Cassowary Intrusion and in the south by the Sharon Dam Intrusion, buried beneath flat lying Nullarbor sediments. The rift zone is bounded on the west by the Madura Crustal Boundary, a long-lived crustal structure parallel to:\n1. Yilgarn Craton margin\u00a0- hosting Tropicana Gold District (multi-Moz gold)\n2. Albany-Fraser mobile belt - hosting IGO's Nova-Bollinger and Legend's nickel-copper deposits\nThe large, Sharon Dam\u00a0and Cassowary\u00a0intrusions sit within the Madura structural corridor and are interpreted to have preserved their original geometries - markedly different from highly deformed intrusions\u00a0within the nearby Albany-Fraser mobile belt.\nRegional Activity\n\u00b7\nBHP Nickel West\npreviously held the southern part of the belt exploring for nickel until 2022.\n\u00b7\nArtemis initially applied for the tenement covering the Cassowary Intrusion (341km2) which was granted in August 2025. Artemis has also applied for 4 additional tenements covering (788km2).\n\u00b7\nWA1 Resources\nhas applied for 2 tenements (~1,000 km\u00b2) covering the area between Artemis's northern and southern blocks and is publicly targeting IOCG and other intrusion related deposits.\n\u00b7\nTeck\nhas applied for 1 tenement 110km south\u00a0along the crustal boundary from Cassowary.\nMost of Artemis's tenement applications\nare expected to be granted in Q1 2026, coinciding with heightened exploration activity and news flow.\nStrategic Rationale: Why This Matters for Artemis Shareholders\n\u00b7\nHigh-impact, low-cost discovery opportunity:\nArtemis secures the right to earn 60% of a large IOCG target for an effective outlay of only $400k, which with EIS co-funding will be used to fund the initial drilling. Artemis can earn 60%\nby spending $5,000,000, less the initial $400k outlay.\n\u00b7\nBelt-scale consolidation:\nThe JV extends Artemis' footprint to control two clusters of interpreted intrusions within 50-70km of strike adjacent to a major prospective structural boundary, strengthening the Company's regional competitive position.\n\u00b7\nDistrict emerging as a strategic hotspot:\nRecent moves by Teck, WA1, and historical interest from BHP support the view that the Madura Crustal Boundary may represent an underexplored mineral province.\n\u00b7\nDrilling in early 2026:\nA clear pathway to drilling provides a near-term catalyst with meaningful upside if the initial drilling confirms Sharon Dam could represent a mineralised intrusion.\n\u00b7\nIntact, undrilled intrusive systems:\nTargets of this size with strong magnetic/gravity coincidence as well as preservation are rare in Australia and offer genuine IOCG discovery potential.\nFigure 1\n- Location plan highlighting mineral deposits and occurrences associated with Proterozoic age crustal boundaries, parallel with the Yilgarn craton margin. Madura Crustal Boundary shown in red\nSharon Dam Target\nPriority Target T1 - Compelling IOCG Candidate\nInterpreted Sharon Dam Intrusion\u00a0is a drill-ready target characterised by:\n\u00b7\nStrong coincident magnetic and gravity anomalies - refer to Figures 3 and 4.\n\u00b7\nCoincident anomalies possibly consistent with IOCG\n\u00b7\nModelling of gravity data implies density of ~3.5 (SG) - possible iron-rich source\n\u00b7\nBounded by NW trending cross-cutting faults - similar to Cassowary Intrusion.\n\u00b7\nSource of the coincident anomalies is modelled at 500-600m depth.\nInterpreted geological setting of Sharon Dam:\n\u00b7\nMain intrusion appears intact with small satellite intrusion on western side - refer to Figure 3\n\u00b7\nSurrounding cluster of other intrusions\u00a0on Artemis tenement application - refer to Figure 2.\n\u00b7\nCentral within >20km wide circular gravity low suggests underlying deep seated granitic body.\nF\nigure 2\n- Magnetic image of interpreted rift zone showing interpreted Cassowary Intrusion\nand\nSharon Dam\nIntrusion (50km south) showing initial planned drill holes\nFigure 3\n- Sharon Dam RTP Magnetic Image overlain by 1VD gravity contours\nshowing planned location of first diamond drill hole\nFigure 4\n- Sharon Dam coincident 3D modelled gravity (top) and magnetic (below) anomalies\nshowing planned location of first diamond drill hole\nExploration Incentive Scheme (EIS) Co-Funding\nRed Metal has previously been awarded an Exploration Incentive Scheme (EIS) co-funded drilling grant of up to $220,000 for the Sharon Dam Project by the Western Australian Government. Under the earn-in and joint venture agreement, any EIS funds received by Red Metal for the approved Sharon Dam drill program will be transferred to Artemis but cannot be used to satisfy Artemis' $400,000 minimum expenditure requirement. As a result, Artemis is required to fund the full minimum drilling commitment, with the EIS refund expected to reduce the Company's net cash outlay for the drilling.\nBinding Earn In and Joint Venture Agreement - Key Terms\n\u00b7\nInitial commitment:\nArtemis has a minimum expenditure requirement of $400,000\u00a0to fund the initial drill hole at Sharon Dam within a 12-month expenditure period\n\u00b7\nThe expenditure period may be extended in event of unexpected delays due to Force Majeure or delays to heritage surveys or other cultural related restraints\n\u00b7\nIf drilling fails to reach target depth, or no favourable geology or indications of mineralisation intersected before 500m depth, the minimum expenditure requirement will reduce to $250,000\n\u00b7\nRed Metal will transfer to Artemis funds received by Red Metal from the EIS co-funding grant (est. ~$220,000) - not to be used to satisfy the minimum expenditure requirement\n\u00b7\nIf Artemis fails to satisfy the minimum expenditure requirement it will be required to pay to Red Metal the short fall between the minimum expenditure requirement, and actual expenditure\n\u00b7\nAfter satisfying the minimum expenditure requirement, Artemis may withdraw from the agreement at any time with no retained interest other than accrued rights and liabilities prior to the withdrawal\n\u00b7\nEarn-in:\nArtemis can earn 60% interest in the Red Metal tenement by spending not less than $5,000,000 (inclusive of the $400,000 minimum expenditure commitment) within 3 years\n\u00b7\nWithin 30 days of earning the 60% interest, an unincorporated joint venture will be formed between Artemis and Red Metal, and Red Metal may elect to reduce its interest to 20% in which event Artemis will increase its interest to 80% and free carry Red Metal's interest to a decision to mine. The joint venture interest will be in proportion to the interest in the Red Metal tenement\n\u00b7\nJoint Venture:\nstandard terms include - JV committee, programs/budgets, pre-emptive rights\n\u00b7\nAssignment:\nparties may assign, transfer, sell or dispose of JV interest to a related body corporate\nNext Steps\n1.\nLodge a work program for first drill hole at Sharon Dam with Pila Nguru Native Title owners\n2.\nOrganise a time with Pila Nguru to conduct a heritage survey of the drill site\n3.\nConfirm existing access track to drill site, arrange water supply with station owner\n4.\nOnce heritage clearance is received, commence drilling using two drill rigs\n5.\nRC drilling to be used through cover sequence, diamond drilling through basement sequence\n6.\nDrilling is targeted to commence in March-April 2026\nAIM Rule Disclosures\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2025, there were $51,212 of losses attributable to these assets.\nAPPENDIX\nExamples of gravity and magnetic signatures for six IOCG deposits and occurrences within the Olympic Dam Copper-Gold Province. Source: Geological Survey South Australia - July 2020\nCautionary Statement\nArtemis wishes to emphasize that the publicly available\ngravity and magnetic expressions of six Iron Oxide Copper-Gold (IOCG) deposits and occurrences illustrated above are\nintended to provide examples of geophysical responses across a range of Australian IOCG - type\ndeposits and occurrences, which have been confirmed by drilling\n.
