          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "15 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 9282O\nArtemis Resources Limited\n15 January 2026\n15 January 2026\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the UK version of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (\"MAR\"). Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nArtemis Resources Limited\n(\"Artemis\" or \"the Company\")\nCancellation of Admission to AIM\nArtemis Resources Limited (ASX/AIM:ARV)\nannounces the cancellation of the admission of its ordinary shares (\"Shares\") to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAIM\n\") (the \"\nCancellation\n\") in accordance with Rule 41 of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nAIM Rules\n\"). It is expected that the Cancellation will occur on 13 February 2026. The Company's primary listing is on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"\nASX\n\") and it has been admitted to trading on AIM since 7 February 2022.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFollowing the Cancellation, the Company's Shares will remain listed on the ASX, which will continue as the primary trading venue for its equity securities. The Company has no intention to delist its Shares from the ASX.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is providing an opportunity for each Depositary Interest (\"\nDI\n\") holder to become a registered shareholder on the Company's Australian share register.\nReasons for the AIM Cancellation\nThe Company is of the view that the Company's admission to trading on AIM is not delivering sufficient value to shareholders, having regard to the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of maintaining admission to trading on AIM, including professional fees, listing fees payable and incremental legal, auditing and other fees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of management time and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's admission to trading on AIM, in addition to its ASX listing,\n\u00b7\nconditions which have impacted stock markets generally since its admission to trading on AIM in February 2022 have made it more challenging to raise capital in the UK; and\n\u00b7\nthe relatively low levels of liquidity and trading volumes in the Company's Shares on AIM.\nThe Board considers the Cancellation will not materially nor adversely impact existing Shareholders as they will still be able to trade on the ASX.\nProcess for Cancellation\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange to cancel admission of the Shares to trading on AIM, and it is expected that the Cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13 February 2026.\nOn the basis that the Company's Shares will continue to be listed on ASX, which is an AIM Designated Market (as defined by the AIM Rules), the Company is not required to seek shareholder approval for the Cancellation.\nThe full timetable of expected events is set out at the end of this announcement.\nPrincipal effects and risks relating to the Cancellation\n\u00b7\nThe Company's Shares will no longer be traded on AIM and the Company has no intention to implement a matched bargain facility to enable trading post Cancellation in the UK;\n\u00b7\nremaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX;\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory and financial reporting regime, including but not limited to, the AIM Rules, the corporate governance requirements for companies trading on AIM and UK MAR, will no longer apply, but the regulatory framework of the ASX, including its corporate governance requirements, and Australian company law will still apply;\n\u00b7\nshareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules, such as the requirement to be notified of certain events, including substantial transactions, financing transactions and related party transactions, and the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain transactions, where applicable, such as reverse takeovers and fundamental changes in the Company's business; albeit similar protection may be afforded pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules, Australian company law and the Australian Corporations Act;\n\u00b7\nZeus Capital Limited will cease to act as nominated adviser and UK broker to the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe Cancellation might have either positive or negative taxation consequences for shareholders. Stamp duty may be due on transfers of Shares and agreements to transfer Shares unless a relevant exemption or relief applies to a particular transfer. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional independent tax advisers.\nThe above considerations are non-exhaustive and shareholders should seek their own independent advice (including tax, financial and legal) when assessing the likely impact of the Cancellation on them.\nInformation for Depositary Interest (DI) holders\nThe Company's Shares will continue to be traded on AIM until market close, being 4.30 p.m. London time, on 12 February 2026 after which, there will be no public market in the UK on which the Shares can be traded. In addition to the delisting, the Company will also be terminating the Depositary Interest service. After the closure of the DI facility on 24 February 2026, all remaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register (being Automic Pty Ltd) and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX. These Shares will be held on the Australian share register in issuer sponsored form, with a holding statement despatched to each former DI holder's registered address. To trade Shares in the future on the ASX, former DI holders will need to engage a broker or a nominee capable of settling on ASX (CHESS).\nDI holders who wish to withdraw their DIs from CREST and take receipt of Shares on the Australian share register, prior to the closure of the DI facility, should contact their broker without delay.\nThe Company advises DI holders to seek independent financial and tax advice regarding the AIM Cancellation and their Shares represented by DIs.\nExpected Timetable of Principal Events\nE\nvent\nTime and/or date\nAnnouncement of proposed AIM Cancellation\n15-Jan-26\nExpected last day of dealings in the Shares on AIM\n12-Feb-26\nExpected time and date of the AIM Cancellation\n7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13\nFebruary\n202\n6\nClosure of the DI Facility\n24-Feb-26\nFurther information\nInformation on the Cancellation and termination of depositary arrangements and the options available to DI holders, including how\nto withdraw from CREST and trade on ASX\n, will be sent to depositary interest holders from Computershare. For further information on the transfer of DI holdings to ASX Shares or for queries related to sale options, please contact: Computershare Investor Services PLC on +44 (0) 370 707 4040.\nThis announcement was approved for release by the Board\n.\nArtemis Resources Ltd\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director\nZeus (Nomad and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi / James Bavister\ninfo@artemisresources.com.au\nTel: + 44 20 3829 5000\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

By partnering with Red Metal we are expanding our footprint 50 kilometres south of the Cassowary Intrusion and putting funds directly into drilling one of the most exciting targets in the region. The Sharon Dam target sits within an area which may host multiple intrusions adjacent to the Madura Crustal Boundary - which we believe is on the cusp of major exploration interest. Consolidation of this belt enhances Artemis' position as a leading copper explorer in a region with IOCG potential.\"\nArtemis Technical Director, Julian Hanna, added:\n\"Sharon Dam is a rare opportunity for Artemis. Not only does it tick all the boxes on technical grounds, the first drill hole into the centre of this compelling target will be co-funded by a substantial EIS grant reducing the funding requirement from Artemis. Our exploration team is looking forward to working closely with Red Metal on the Sharon Dam project, and with the Pila Nguru Native Title Holders and local station owners on the wider Cassowary Project which extends 70km along this overlooked belt.\"\nFrontier IOCG Search Space: Madura Crustal Boundary -\nExceptional Geological Opportunity\nRecent interpretations of geophysical data by Artemis have identified a >30km-wide rift zone\u00a0which appears to host multiple interpreted intrusions\u00a0- dominated in the north by the Cassowary Intrusion and in the south by the Sharon Dam Intrusion, buried beneath flat lying Nullarbor sediments. The rift zone is bounded on the west by the Madura Crustal Boundary, a long-lived crustal structure parallel to:\n1. Yilgarn Craton margin\u00a0- hosting Tropicana Gold District (multi-Moz gold)\n2. Albany-Fraser mobile belt - hosting IGO's Nova-Bollinger and Legend's nickel-copper deposits\nThe large, Sharon Dam\u00a0and Cassowary\u00a0intrusions sit within the Madura structural corridor and are interpreted to have preserved their original geometries - markedly different from highly deformed intrusions\u00a0within the nearby Albany-Fraser mobile belt.\nRegional Activity\n\u00b7\nBHP Nickel West\npreviously held the southern part of the belt exploring for nickel until 2022.\n\u00b7\nArtemis initially applied for the tenement covering the Cassowary Intrusion (341km2) which was granted in August 2025. Artemis has also applied for 4 additional tenements covering (788km2).\n\u00b7\nWA1 Resources\nhas applied for 2 tenements (~1,000 km\u00b2) covering the area between Artemis's northern and southern blocks and is publicly targeting IOCG and other intrusion related deposits.\n\u00b7\nTeck\nhas applied for 1 tenement 110km south\u00a0along the crustal boundary from Cassowary.\nMost of Artemis's tenement applications\nare expected to be granted in Q1 2026, coinciding with heightened exploration activity and news flow.\nStrategic Rationale: Why This Matters for Artemis Shareholders\n\u00b7\nHigh-impact, low-cost discovery opportunity:\nArtemis secures the right to earn 60% of a large IOCG target for an effective outlay of only $400k, which with EIS co-funding will be used to fund the initial drilling. Artemis can earn 60%\nby spending $5,000,000, less the initial $400k outlay.\n\u00b7\nBelt-scale consolidation:\nThe JV extends Artemis' footprint to control two clusters of interpreted intrusions within 50-70km of strike adjacent to a major prospective structural boundary, strengthening the Company's regional competitive position.\n\u00b7\nDistrict emerging as a strategic hotspot:\nRecent moves by Teck, WA1, and historical interest from BHP support the view that the Madura Crustal Boundary may represent an underexplored mineral province.\n\u00b7\nDrilling in early 2026:\nA clear pathway to drilling provides a near-term catalyst with meaningful upside if the initial drilling confirms Sharon Dam could represent a mineralised intrusion.\n\u00b7\nIntact, undrilled intrusive systems:\nTargets of this size with strong magnetic/gravity coincidence as well as preservation are rare in Australia and offer genuine IOCG discovery potential.\nFigure 1\n- Location plan highlighting mineral deposits and occurrences associated with Proterozoic age crustal boundaries, parallel with the Yilgarn craton margin. Madura Crustal Boundary shown in red\nSharon Dam Target\nPriority Target T1 - Compelling IOCG Candidate\nInterpreted Sharon Dam Intrusion\u00a0is a drill-ready target characterised by:\n\u00b7\nStrong coincident magnetic and gravity anomalies - refer to Figures 3 and 4.\n\u00b7\nCoincident anomalies possibly consistent with IOCG\n\u00b7\nModelling of gravity data implies density of ~3.5 (SG) - possible iron-rich source\n\u00b7\nBounded by NW trending cross-cutting faults - similar to Cassowary Intrusion.\n\u00b7\nSource of the coincident anomalies is modelled at 500-600m depth.\nInterpreted geological setting of Sharon Dam:\n\u00b7\nMain intrusion appears intact with small satellite intrusion on western side - refer to Figure 3\n\u00b7\nSurrounding cluster of other intrusions\u00a0on Artemis tenement application - refer to Figure 2.\n\u00b7\nCentral within >20km wide circular gravity low suggests underlying deep seated granitic body.\nF\nigure 2\n- Magnetic image of interpreted rift zone showing interpreted Cassowary Intrusion\nand\nSharon Dam\nIntrusion (50km south) showing initial planned drill holes\nFigure 3\n- Sharon Dam RTP Magnetic Image overlain by 1VD gravity contours\nshowing planned location of first diamond drill hole\nFigure 4\n- Sharon Dam coincident 3D modelled gravity (top) and magnetic (below) anomalies\nshowing planned location of first diamond drill hole\nExploration Incentive Scheme (EIS) Co-Funding\nRed Metal has previously been awarded an Exploration Incentive Scheme (EIS) co-funded drilling grant of up to $220,000 for the Sharon Dam Project by the Western Australian Government. Under the earn-in and joint venture agreement, any EIS funds received by Red Metal for the approved Sharon Dam drill program will be transferred to Artemis but cannot be used to satisfy Artemis' $400,000 minimum expenditure requirement. As a result, Artemis is required to fund the full minimum drilling commitment, with the EIS refund expected to reduce the Company's net cash outlay for the drilling.\nBinding Earn In and Joint Venture Agreement - Key Terms\n\u00b7\nInitial commitment:\nArtemis has a minimum expenditure requirement of $400,000\u00a0to fund the initial drill hole at Sharon Dam within a 12-month expenditure period\n\u00b7\nThe expenditure period may be extended in event of unexpected delays due to Force Majeure or delays to heritage surveys or other cultural related restraints\n\u00b7\nIf drilling fails to reach target depth, or no favourable geology or indications of mineralisation intersected before 500m depth, the minimum expenditure requirement will reduce to $250,000\n\u00b7\nRed Metal will transfer to Artemis funds received by Red Metal from the EIS co-funding grant (est. ~$220,000) - not to be used to satisfy the minimum expenditure requirement\n\u00b7\nIf Artemis fails to satisfy the minimum expenditure requirement it will be required to pay to Red Metal the short fall between the minimum expenditure requirement, and actual expenditure\n\u00b7\nAfter satisfying the minimum expenditure requirement, Artemis may withdraw from the agreement at any time with no retained interest other than accrued rights and liabilities prior to the withdrawal\n\u00b7\nEarn-in:\nArtemis can earn 60% interest in the Red Metal tenement by spending not less than $5,000,000 (inclusive of the $400,000 minimum expenditure commitment) within 3 years\n\u00b7\nWithin 30 days of earning the 60% interest, an unincorporated joint venture will be formed between Artemis and Red Metal, and Red Metal may elect to reduce its interest to 20% in which event Artemis will increase its interest to 80% and free carry Red Metal's interest to a decision to mine. The joint venture interest will be in proportion to the interest in the Red Metal tenement\n\u00b7\nJoint Venture:\nstandard terms include - JV committee, programs/budgets, pre-emptive rights\n\u00b7\nAssignment:\nparties may assign, transfer, sell or dispose of JV interest to a related body corporate\nNext Steps\n1.\nLodge a work program for first drill hole at Sharon Dam with Pila Nguru Native Title owners\n2.\nOrganise a time with Pila Nguru to conduct a heritage survey of the drill site\n3.\nConfirm existing access track to drill site, arrange water supply with station owner\n4.\nOnce heritage clearance is received, commence drilling using two drill rigs\n5.\nRC drilling to be used through cover sequence, diamond drilling through basement sequence\n6.\nDrilling is targeted to commence in March-April 2026\nAIM Rule Disclosures\nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2025, there were $51,212 of losses attributable to these assets.\nAPPENDIX\nExamples of gravity and magnetic signatures for six IOCG deposits and occurrences within the Olympic Dam Copper-Gold Province.

The combination of the previously reported high-grade intercept in hole 25ARRC006 and the newly reported wide intersection in 25ARRC025 reinforces our interpretation of a potentially substantial shear-hosted gold structure with encouraging width and continuity.\nWhile numerous assays from five RC holes and one diamond hole remain pending, the consistency of alteration, veining and mineralisation observed across multiple holes provides increasing confidence in the potential of this emerging zone. The commencement of diamond drilling marks an important step in advancing our geological understanding, with structural information from this hole expected to materially inform follow-up targeting and drilling design.\nTitan East represents a compelling growth opportunity within the broader Carlow Gold-Copper Project, and results from the current programs are expected to underpin an expanded drilling campaign in early 2026\"\nStrategic Context and Program Overview\nInitial RC drilling earlier this year\n[2]\n, targeting strong rock-chip samples at surface\n[3]\n, provided early encouragement that Titan East may host a mineralised structure beneath shallow cover. These results established the area as a credible new target located only 1.5km from the existing Carlow deposit (Inferred Resource 374koz Au and 64kt Cu\n[4]\n).\nThe subsequent drilling program materially upgraded the prospectivity of the area, returning an exceptional high-grade intersection of\n5m @ 13.1g/t Au\nfrom 132m in hole 25ARRC006. This result identified the potential of the newly identified interpreted shear zone and provided a clear rationale to accelerate follow-up exploration.\nBuilding on this momentum, Artemis completed a follow-up six hole RC drilling program in November along a 600m strike length of the interpreted shear zone. Several holes intersected broad zones of alteration and veining consistent with gold-bearing systems, with selective intervals submitted for fast-track analysis.\nAssay results from the first hole of this program returned a wide intersection of\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au\nfrom 127m in hole 25ARRC025. Encouraged by these early results, the Company has moved quickly to commence diamond drilling to define the geometry and scale of the mineralised structure.\nFigure 1: Interpreted Long Section showing geological/structural interpretation, Titan East discovery drill hole intersections, outline of Carlow Resource and planned drill holes to test extensions to known high grade gold and copper mineralisation during March quarter 2026\nTitan East - Summary of Recent and Current Drilling\nPhase One\n:\nTen RC holes were drilled in September 2025 to test three priority targets at Titan East (Figure 1). Two of the RC holes intersected a previously untested mineralised structure, interpreted to be a wide north-east trending shear zone beneath shallow cover, with holes 25ARRC006 and 25ARRC024 returning broad intervals of gold mineralisation (Tables 1-2). Drilling away from the interpreted shear zone returned no significant intersections.\nPhase Two\n:\nSix follow-up RC holes (25ARRC025-030) were completed in November 2025 along a 600m strike length to assess the potential of the interpreted shear zone highlighted in Phase One. Five of the six holes intersected broad zones of alteration and veining and fast track assay results for the first hole, 25ARRC025 resulted in an intersection\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au from 127m, including 6m @ 2.63g/t Au from 131m\n(Refer to Table 3).\nPhase Three\n:\nA 300m diamond drill hole (25ARDD006) commenced on 10 December to provide structural information across the shear zone and test potential for extensions to the high-grade gold mineralisation in 25ARRC006. 25ARDD006 has intersected a wide interval with strong quartz veining above a strongly altered contact at the base of the shear zone (Figures 5 and 6). Drilling was completed on 18 December. Detailed logging and sampling of the drill core is planned in early January with assay results expected later in the March quarter.\nFigure 2: Carlow tenement showing outline of Carlow gold-copper deposit, location of Titan East and access to Carlow Project area from Karratha\nFigure 3: Geological and structural interpretation of Carlow tenement showing Carlow gold-copper deposit, interpreted shear zones and high-grade gold intersections at Titan East\nFigure 4: Satellite image of Titan East showing completed RC drill holes and location of the diamond drill hole (25ARDD006 - green star) testing the basal contact of the shear zone.\nFigure 5: 25ARDD006 - drill core from 140.0-164.8m showing intensive quartz veining and related alteration within interpreted Titan East shear zone (assays pending)\nFigure 6: 25ARDD006 - drill core from 164.8-185.0m showing strong alteration associated with basal contact of interpreted Titan East shear zone (assays pending)\nRegarding drill core from hole 25ARDD006 included in Figures 5 and 6 above:\n\u00b7\nThere are no identified or reported visual occurrences of gold mineralisation\n\u00b7\nThere are no visible minerals which could provide an estimate of possible gold abundance\n\u00b7\nSamples will be sent for analysis in early January with results expected in March quarter\nCautionary Statement\nArtemis emphasises that visual interpretations of drill core shown in Figures 5 and 6, including: intensive quartz veining within the interpreted Titan East shear zone and strong alteration associated with the basal contact of the interpreted shear zone - are not intended to indicate the presence of possible gold mineralisation. Laboratory analysis of samples of drill core is required to determine if any gold mineralisation is associated with the quartz veining or alteration.\nTitan East - Next Steps\n\u00b7\nComplete logging of diamond hole 25ARDD006, send samples for assay in early January\n\u00b7\nReceive assay results from 5 RC holes and diamond hole - expected March quarter 2026\n\u00b7\nFollow-up RC and diamond drilling along shear zone - planned March quarter 2026\n\u00b7\nUpdated geological model and next set of targets - planned late March quarter 2026\nFigure 7: Project Geologist Tony Sheehan with drill chips from 25ARRC025 (140-160m) including veined, altered ultramafic sequence and sediments (Refer Table 3)\nTable 1: 25ARRC006 - high-grade gold intersection announced 29 October 2025 within 20m\nwide (131m-151m) interval of strongly elevated gold assays within Titan East shear zone\n[5]\nCollar\nFrom\nTo\nWidth\nAu g/t\n25ARRC024\n116\n118\n2\n0.34\n25ARRC024\n118\n119\n1\n0.81\n25ARRC024\n119\n120\n1\n0.09\n25ARRC024\n120\n121\n1\n0.03\n25ARRC024\n121\n122\n1\n0.01\n25ARRC024\n122\n123\n1\n0.03\n25ARRC024\n123\n124\n1\n0.13\n25ARRC024\n124\n125\n1\n0.03\n25ARRC024\n125\n126\n1\n0.16\n25ARRC024\n126\n127\n1\n0.39\n25ARRC024\n127\n128\n1\n0.24\n25ARRC024\n128\n129\n1\n0.16\n25ARRC024\n129\n130\n1\n0.19\n25ARRC024\n130\n131\n1\n0.06\n25ARRC024\n131\n132\n1\n0.02\n25ARRC024\n132\n133\n1\n0.05\n25ARRC024\n133\n134\n1\n0.08\n25ARRC024\n134\n135\n1\n0.61\n25ARRC024\n135\n136\n1\n0.5\n25ARRC024\n136\n137\n1\n0.06\n25ARRC024\n137\n138\n1\n0.06\n25ARRC024\n138\n139\n1\n0.06\n25ARRC024\n139\n140\n1\n0.72\nTable 2: 25ARRC024 - strongly elevated gold assays for 1m sample intervals within 24m wide (116m-140m) interval within Titan East shear zone.
