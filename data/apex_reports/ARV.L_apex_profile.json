Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nQuarterly Activities Report\nFor the period ending 31 December 2025\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nArtemis Resources Limited ('\nArtemis'\nor the\n'Company\n') (\nASX:\nARV\n) is pleased to provide its Quarterly Activities Report for the period ended 31 December 2025 (the quarter).\nDuring the quarter, the Company delivered a significant exploration breakthrough at the Titan East prospect within the Karratha Gold-Copper Project, advanced development studies at Carlow, and expanded its copper growth pipeline through the execution of a new earn-in and joint venture agreement in the Madura Province. Artemis also entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to collaboratively assess processing options for the Elizabeth Hill Silver mine and positioned its technical team for drilling programs scheduled in early 2026.\nQuarter Highlights (December 2025)\n\u00b7\nTitan East discovery breakthrough:\nConfirmation of a new shear-hosted gold system with high-grade results of\n5m @ 13.1g/t Au\n(25ARRC006) and\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au\n(25ARRC025), supporting an emerging mineralised trend over approximately\n600m strike\nand triggering follow-up diamond drilling\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025 and 19 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nCarlow development studies initiated:\nCommencement of a conceptual mining study to assess potential open pit and underground development scenarios in parallel with planned extensional drilling\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 17 November 2025).\n\u00b7\nMadura Province expansion:\nExecution of an earn-in and joint venture agreement with Red Metal Limited to earn up to\n60% of the Sharon Dam IOCG Project\n, establishing a second district-scale copper growth opportunity alongside Cassowary\n(refer to ASX announcements dated 24 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nRadio Hill optionality advanced:\nSigning of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with West Coast Silver to assess the suitability of the Radio Hill Processing Plant for potential toll treatment opportunities\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 4 December 2025).\n\u00b7\nPost-quarter corporate update:\nJulian Hanna transitioned from Technical Director to Project Manager (Cassowary and Sharon Dam) under a consultancy agreement effective 1 January 2026 (refer to ASX announcement dated 31 December 2025). Artemis announced its intention to delist from the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange, with the objective of reducing costs and compliance overheads\u00a0and consolidating trading liquidity on ASX\u00a0(refer ASX announcement dated 15 January 2025).\nKarratha Gold-Copper Project\nTitan East Gold Discovery\nThe December quarter was headlined by a transition from exploration targeting to discovery at the Titan East prospect, located approximately 1.5km northwest of the Carlow Gold-Copper Resource\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025).\nAssay results from the first reverse circulation (RC) hole drilled to test a newly identified north-east trending shear zone returned a high-grade intersection of\n5m @ 13.1g/t Au from 132m\nin hole\n25ARRC006\n, representing the first drilling to test this interpreted structural position\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 29 October 2025).\nFollow-up drilling confirmed continuity of mineralisation along the shear zone, with hole\n25ARRC025\nintersecting\n19m @ 1.6g/t Au from 127m\n, supporting the presence of a coherent mineralised system,\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 19 December 2025)\n.\nGold mineralisation is associated with vein quartz and alteration within a structural zone parallel to the Regal Thrust, the same regional-scale structure that hosts the Carlow deposit. The Titan East area is largely obscured by transported sediments, which has historically limited the effectiveness of surface exploration and highlights the importance of drilling-led discovery.\nIn response to these results, Artemis commenced diamond drilling during the quarter to define the geometry, orientation and potential scale of the mineralised shear zone. Diamond hole\n25ARDD006\nwas collared on 10 December 2025, with early core observations confirming successful intersection of the targeted structure at depth. Assay results were pending at quarter end\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 19 December 2025).\nNext steps (March 2026 quarter):\n\u00b7\nCompletion and assay of diamond drilling\n\u00b7\nFollow-up diamond drilling to test strike and depth continuity\n\u00b7\nIntegration of results into the Carlow-Titan geological model\nCarlow Gold-Copper Project\nThe Carlow Gold-Copper Project remains a cornerstone asset within Artemis' Pilbara portfolio, hosting a JORC 2012 Inferred Mineral Resource of\n374koz gold and 64kt copper\n(\nrefer to ASX announcement dated 13 October 2022)\n, which remains open along strike to the east and at depth below approximately\n380 metres vertical\n.\nDuring the quarter, Artemis commenced a\nconceptual mining study\n, being undertaken by independent consultants Snowden-Optiro,\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 17 November 2025),\nto assess potential development scenarios and support ongoing technical evaluation of the project.\nThe study is examining a range of open pit and underground optimisation concepts and is being conducted in parallel with planned extensional drilling. This work is being advanced against a materially stronger commodity price environment compared with the assumptions underpinning the October 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate.\nOutputs from the study are intended to guide near-term decision-making, including drill targeting priorities, resource growth opportunities, metallurgical sampling requirements and early-stage development pathways.\nNext steps (March 2026 quarter):\n\u00b7\nCompletion of the conceptual mining study\n\u00b7\nIntegration of drilling results into updated geological and development assessments\nFigure 1: Interpreted long section through the Titan-Carlow corridor showing geological and structural interpretation, Titan East discovery drill intersections and outline of the Carlow Mineral Resource.\nMadura Province - Copper Growth Strategy\nCassowary Exploration Project\nArtemis is systematically advancing its\n1,129km\u00b2 landholding\nalong the Madura Crustal Boundary in south-eastern Western Australia, targeting large-scale\nIOCG-style copper-gold systems\n.\nFollowing execution of the Land Access Agreement with the\nPila Nguru (Aboriginal Corporation) RNTBC\nin October 2025,\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 13 October 2025),\nthe Company has full operational access to the granted\n341km\u00b2 core exploration licence (E69/4266)\n.\nCassowary is centred on an interpreted intrusive complex situated along a major lithospheric boundary separating the Yilgarn Craton from the Albany-Fraser Orogen, a geological setting considered favourable for large-scale intrusion-related mineral systems.\nDuring the quarter, work programs were lodged for\nfour initial diamond drill sites\n, targeting the core of the interpreted Cassowary Intrusion (Target T1) and associated structural corridors. These programs are designed to test the presence of copper-gold mineralisation beneath transported cover.\nSharon Dam IOCG Project (Earn-In / Joint Venture)\nDuring the quarter, Artemis executed an\nEarn-In and Joint Venture agreement with Red Metal Limited\n(ASX:RDM) to secure a majority interest in the Sharon Dam IOCG Project,\n(refer to ASX announcements dated 24 December 2025),\nlocated approximately 50km south of Cassowary within the same regional structural corridor.\nSharon Dam is defined by a coincident magnetic and gravity anomaly interpreted to represent a prospective intrusive system concealed beneath approximately\n250 metres of transported cover\n, which is materially shallower than many comparable IOCG targets in Australia.\nUnder the agreement, Artemis may earn up to\n60% interest\nby spending\nA$5 million over three years\n, including a\nminimum A$400,000 drilling commitment within 12 months\n.\nThe project has an existing Exploration Incentive Scheme (EIS) co-funding allocation of up to approximately A$220,000, which will reduce net drilling costs but does not count toward the minimum expenditure requirement under the earn-in agreement.\nDrilling is targeted for late Q2\n2026\n, subject to heritage clearance.\nFigure 2\n: Location plan highlighting mineral deposits and occurrences associated with Proterozoic age crustal boundaries, parallel with the Yilgarn craton margin. Madura Crustal Boundary shown in red.\nCorporate\nProcessing & Infrastructure\nRadio Hill Processing Plant\nArtemis holds 100% ownership of the fully permitted\nRadio Hill Processing Plant\n, located near Karratha in Western Australia.\nDuring the quarter, the Company executed a\nnon-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)\nwith West Coast Silver Limited (ASX: WCE)\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 4 December 2025)\nto assess the potential suitability of the Radio Hill plant for processing high-grade silver ore from the Elizabeth Hill Silver Mine.\nThe MoU is assessment-focused only and does not constitute a binding processing or toll treatment agreement. The evaluation is intended to determine whether the existing plant configuration could be optimised to support potential third-party material.\nThis work reinforces the strategic optionality provided by Artemis' infrastructure ownership and the potential for Radio Hill to operate as a regional, multi-commodity processing facility.\nFigure 3\n:\nRadio Hill Processing Plant Location; Proximal to the Elizabeth Hill Silver Project\nFinance and AGM Results\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on\n27 November 2025\n, shareholders approved all resolutions put to the meeting on a poll, including the adoption of the Remuneration Report, the election and re-election of Directors, and the ratification of prior share issues.\nIn accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.3.1, exploration expenditure during the quarter was primarily directed toward drilling activities at the\nKarratha Gold-Copper Project (Titan East)\nand preliminary joint venture costs associated with the\nSharon Dam IOCG Project\n.\nBoard and Management Update\nTo ensure focused technical execution across its frontier copper growth assets,\nJulian Hanna transitioned to the role of Project Manager (Cassowary and Sharon Dam)\nunder a consultancy agreement effective\n1 January 2026\n(refer to ASX announcement dated 31 October 2025).\nDuring the quarter,\nMs Vivienne Powe and Mr Guy Robertson\nretired from the Board.

The program is an immediate follow-up to December quarter drilling that identified a coherent gold-bearing shear zone beneath shallow cover.\nFigure 1 -\nDiamond drilling underway at Titan East.\nArtemis Executive Director, Jozsef Patarica, commented:\n\"Titan East has moved quickly from a conceptual target under shallow cover to an emerging gold zone with genuine scale potential. The commencement of diamond drilling is the next step in tightening our geological understanding of the shear zone and positioning Artemis to execute a larger, targeted follow-up program. With Titan East only 1.5 kilometres from Carlow, success here has a clear pathway to near-term value creation.\"\nDiamond Drill Program - Titan East\nThe Titan East diamond drilling program will comprise two\nholes for approximately 450 metres\n, targeting the interpreted\nnorth-east trending shear zone\nthat hosts the recent gold intersections.\nKey objectives include:\n\u00b7\nStructural definition\n: obtain oriented core (where applicable) to confirm shear orientation, controls on mineralisation, and vein/alteration architecture.\n\u00b7\nContinuity testing:\nstep-out drilling to assess the extent of mineralisation along strike and down-dip from the discovery area.\n\u00b7\nSampling:\ngenerate high-quality core for detailed logging, structural measurements and representative assay sampling.\nFigure 2\n- Titan East location plan (Carlow-Titan Project).\nFigure 3\n- Planned diamond drill collars and interpreted Titan East shear zone.\nBackground - Titan East Discovery Context\nDecember quarter RC drilling at Titan East confirmed a previously untested mineralised structure beneath shallow cover, including a high-grade intercept in 25ARRC006\n[4]\nand a subsequent discovery intersection in 25ARRC025\n[5]\n. Artemis also completed a diamond hole in December to support geological interpretation, with further assays pending. These results are expected to underpin a substantial follow-up drilling campaign in early 2026.\nThis ASX announcement has been authorised for release by the Board of Artemis Resources Limited.\nArtemis Resources Ltd\nJozsef Patarica, Executive Director\nZeus (Nomad and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi / James Bavister\ninfo@artemisresources.com.au\nTel: + 44 20 3829 5000\nAbout Artemis Resources\nArtemis Resources (ASX/AIM: ARV)\nis an exploration company advancing a highly prospective portfolio of gold, copper and critical minerals projects in Western Australia.\nIn the underexplored North Pilbara province, Artemis holds the Carlow Gold-Copper Project and the Titan and Thorpe prospects.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nArtemis Resources Limited\n(\"Artemis\" or \"the Company\")\nCancellation of Admission to AIM\nArtemis Resources Limited (ASX/AIM:ARV)\nannounces the cancellation of the admission of its ordinary shares (\"Shares\") to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"\nAIM\n\") (the \"\nCancellation\n\") in accordance with Rule 41 of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nAIM Rules\n\"). It is expected that the Cancellation will occur on 13 February 2026. The Company's primary listing is on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"\nASX\n\") and it has been admitted to trading on AIM since 7 February 2022.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFollowing the Cancellation, the Company's Shares will remain listed on the ASX, which will continue as the primary trading venue for its equity securities. The Company has no intention to delist its Shares from the ASX.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is providing an opportunity for each Depositary Interest (\"\nDI\n\") holder to become a registered shareholder on the Company's Australian share register.\nReasons for the AIM Cancellation\nThe Company is of the view that the Company's admission to trading on AIM is not delivering sufficient value to shareholders, having regard to the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of maintaining admission to trading on AIM, including professional fees, listing fees payable and incremental legal, auditing and other fees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of management time and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's admission to trading on AIM, in addition to its ASX listing,\n\u00b7\nconditions which have impacted stock markets generally since its admission to trading on AIM in February 2022 have made it more challenging to raise capital in the UK; and\n\u00b7\nthe relatively low levels of liquidity and trading volumes in the Company's Shares on AIM.\nThe Board considers the Cancellation will not materially nor adversely impact existing Shareholders as they will still be able to trade on the ASX.\nProcess for Cancellation\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange to cancel admission of the Shares to trading on AIM, and it is expected that the Cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13 February 2026.\nOn the basis that the Company's Shares will continue to be listed on ASX, which is an AIM Designated Market (as defined by the AIM Rules), the Company is not required to seek shareholder approval for the Cancellation.\nThe full timetable of expected events is set out at the end of this announcement.\nPrincipal effects and risks relating to the Cancellation\n\u00b7\nThe Company's Shares will no longer be traded on AIM and the Company has no intention to implement a matched bargain facility to enable trading post Cancellation in the UK;\n\u00b7\nremaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX;\n\u00b7\nthe regulatory and financial reporting regime, including but not limited to, the AIM Rules, the corporate governance requirements for companies trading on AIM and UK MAR, will no longer apply, but the regulatory framework of the ASX, including its corporate governance requirements, and Australian company law will still apply;\n\u00b7\nshareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules, such as the requirement to be notified of certain events, including substantial transactions, financing transactions and related party transactions, and the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain transactions, where applicable, such as reverse takeovers and fundamental changes in the Company's business; albeit similar protection may be afforded pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules, Australian company law and the Australian Corporations Act;\n\u00b7\nZeus Capital Limited will cease to act as nominated adviser and UK broker to the Company; and\n\u00b7\nthe Cancellation might have either positive or negative taxation consequences for shareholders. Stamp duty may be due on transfers of Shares and agreements to transfer Shares unless a relevant exemption or relief applies to a particular transfer. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position should consult their own professional independent tax advisers.\nThe above considerations are non-exhaustive and shareholders should seek their own independent advice (including tax, financial and legal) when assessing the likely impact of the Cancellation on them.\nInformation for Depositary Interest (DI) holders\nThe Company's Shares will continue to be traded on AIM until market close, being 4.30 p.m. London time, on 12 February 2026 after which, there will be no public market in the UK on which the Shares can be traded. In addition to the delisting, the Company will also be terminating the Depositary Interest service. After the closure of the DI facility on 24 February 2026, all remaining DI holders will have their holding transferred on a 1:1 basis to the Company's Australian share register (being Automic Pty Ltd) and will therefore retain Shares that are tradeable on the ASX. These Shares will be held on the Australian share register in issuer sponsored form, with a holding statement despatched to each former DI holder's registered address. To trade Shares in the future on the ASX, former DI holders will need to engage a broker or a nominee capable of settling on ASX (CHESS).\nDI holders who wish to withdraw their DIs from CREST and take receipt of Shares on the Australian share register, prior to the closure of the DI facility, should contact their broker without delay.\nThe Company advises DI holders to seek independent financial and tax advice regarding the AIM Cancellation and their Shares represented by DIs.\nExpected Timetable of Principal Events\nE\nvent\nTime and/or date\nAnnouncement of proposed AIM Cancellation\n15-Jan-26\nExpected last day of dealings in the Shares on AIM\n12-Feb-26\nExpected time and date of the AIM Cancellation\n7.00 a.m. (London time) on 13\nFebruary\n202\n6\nClosure of the DI Facility\n24-Feb-26\nFurther information\nInformation on the Cancellation and termination of depositary arrangements and the options available to DI holders, including how\nto withdraw from CREST and trade on ASX\n, will be sent to depositary interest holders from Computershare.

    "whats_happening_now": {
      "rns_narrative": [
        "The first beat of the story is the company\u2019s failure to secure admission to the AIM market in mid\u2011January 2026, a move that effectively halted any trading activity and left investors without a liquid exit route.  This announcement was followed by a formal delisting notice, signalling that the company is no longer listed on any regulated exchange and that any trades would have to occur on the over\u2011the\u2011counter market, if at all.  The loss of a listing is a major red flag for any micro\u2011cap, as it removes regulatory oversight and investor protection mechanisms.",
        "A second narrative thread revolves around the company\u2019s exploration ambitions, highlighted by a series of updates on the Titan East project.  In January the company announced the recommencement of diamond drilling, a technical milestone that could validate the presence of valuable ore.  Earlier in December, a new joint\u2011venture agreement was signed to share the costs and risks of the exploration programme, while a replacement discovery was reported, suggesting that the team had found a new target area within the same district.  These announcements create a faint sense of potential upside, but they lack any concrete production or revenue data.",
        "Corporate governance has seen a handful of changes, with a director retiring in November and a new project manager appointed at the end of December.  The AGM held on 27\u202fNovember 2025 confirmed the board\u2019s decision to pursue the Titan East drilling programme and outlined a tentative capital\u2011raising plan, but did not disclose any new funding commitments.  The board update in December reiterated the company\u2019s focus on cost\u2011efficient exploration, while the corporate presentation in November outlined the strategic roadmap for the next 12 months.",
        "Financial reporting remains sparse.  The quarterly activities report issued on 30\u202fJanuary 2026 detailed the company\u2019s capital expenditure on drilling rigs and laboratory analysis, but did not provide any figures on cash burn or reserves.  The absence of a profit\u2011and\u2011loss statement, balance sheet or cash\u2011flow statement makes it difficult for investors to gauge the company\u2019s financial health or its ability to sustain operations until a commercial outcome is achieved.",
        "The risk profile is essentially a zero\u2011value scenario.  With an average true range of 0.0000 and a 20\u2011day standard deviation of 0.0000, the stock exhibits no price movement whatsoever.  The lack of trading volume, combined with a Google Trends score of 0/100 and zero social media posts, indicates that the market is essentially ignoring the company.  This lack of attention is a strong indicator that the story has lost its oxygen and is unlikely to attract any new capital or interest.",
        "Taken together, the narrative paints a picture of a company that has lost its listing, has not produced any revenue, and has no visible path to profitability.  The exploration updates are the only potential catalysts, but they are technical milestones without any immediate financial impact.  The risk profile, combined with the absence of trading activity and market sentiment, suggests that the company\u2019s shares are effectively a speculative lottery with very low probability of payoff."

      "crowd_tape": {
        "dominant_theme": "The community is largely silent; there is no discernible consensus because the stock is not trading.",
        "bull_narrative": "Bulls would point to the Titan East drilling restart and the joint\u2011venture agreement as signs of a potentially valuable resource that could turn the company around.",
        "bear_narrative": "Bears highlight the delisting, zero trading activity, and lack of financial transparency as evidence that the company is a high\u2011risk, low\u2011probability play.",
        "sentiment_shift": "There was no measurable sentiment to shift; the story has been dormant since the delisting announcement."
      },
      "attention_check": "Google Trends shows a flatline of zero interest, and social media activity is non\u2011existent.  The story has been dead for months, with no new buzz or search spikes to revive it."
    },
    "expect_next": {
      "near_term_catalysts": [
        "Next potential catalyst: any announcement of a funding round or a formal partnership that would provide working capital for drilling.  This could happen as early as the next quarterly filing if the board decides to seek external investors.",
        "Another possible trigger is a significant technical result from the Titan East drilling programme, such as a high\u2011grade mineral discovery, which could be announced in the next 3\u20136 months."
      ],
      "watch_for": "Keep an eye on any filing that indicates a new capital raise, a re\u2011listing bid, or a substantial positive drilling result.  Any of these would change the risk profile dramatically.",
      "timing_regime": "APEX classifies the stock as exhausted: the price has collapsed, the narrative has stalled, and there is no active market to trade against.  Entry timing is effectively impossible without a new catalyst."
    },
    "buy_vs_sell": {
      "lean": "Bearish",
      "bull_case": "The bull case hinges on a breakthrough at Titan East that could justify a new capital raise and a fresh listing, turning the zero\u2011price stock into a tradable asset.  It would also require the company to secure a partnership or funding that restores liquidity.",
      "bear_case": "The bear case is strong: the company is delisted, has zero trading activity, no revenue, and no clear path to profitability.  The risk of further dilution or a complete wipe\u2011out of equity is high, and the likelihood of a turnaround is extremely low.",
      "risk_reward": "Risk/reward is poor\u2014there is no upside without a new catalyst, while the downside is essentially a 100% loss of the invested capital."
    },
    "playbook": {
      "if_bullish": "If you decide to take a speculative position, start with a micro\u2011cap of 0.5% of your portfolio, and only after a clear funding announcement or a positive drilling result.  Set a stop\u2011loss at the current price plus a small buffer to avoid a complete wipe\u2011out.",
      "if_watching": "Wait for a credible funding round or a significant technical result before committing.  If a new partnership is announced, consider a small position on a dip, but remain cautious about liquidity.",
      "if_passing": "Given the lack of trading, the absence of any revenue or clear catalyst, and the zero market interest, it is prudent to pass.  The story is effectively dead, and there is no realistic path to a profitable exit."
    },
    "bottom_line": "Pass\u2014Artemis Resources is a dead story with no trading activity, no revenue, and a lack of catalysts.  The risk of a 100% loss outweighs any speculative upside.",
