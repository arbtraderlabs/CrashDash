(\"Touchstone\", \"we\", \"our\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nprovides an operational update on the Carapal Ridge-3 development well (\"CR-3\"), located on the Central block onshore in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\nTouchstone holds a 65 percent operating working interest in the well, with Heritage Petroleum Company Limited holding the remaining 35 percent.\nHighlights\nCR-3 is the first well drilled into the Carapal Ridge pool in the past 17 years and encountered approximately 1,082 feet of net sand, including approximately 1,000 feet of net Herrera sand.\nOpen-hole wireline logging, mud logging, and drilling data collectively indicate the presence of hydrocarbon-bearing sands throughout the Herrera interval.\nThe well encountered a thick pay zone across multiple Herrera horizons, both above and below a shale marker.\nCompletion operations are underway, with tie-in to the Central block natural gas processing facility targeted for the first quarter of 2026.\nThe well results support the potential for up to three additional Herrera development wells on the Central block.\nCR-3 also established a second, uphole, gas-charged play in the Karamat formation, which is being evaluated as a stand-alone prospect for potential drilling.\nThe CR-3 well was spud on November 23, 2025, using Star Valley Drilling Rig #205 and was drilled to a total depth of 8,200 feet over a 35-day period. Following open-hole logging operations, the well was cased for future production. Based on initial field-level cost estimates, the well was approximately 25 percent over budget and did not require any sidetrack operations. The additional time and costs were primarily attributable to efforts required to control natural gas flows from the Karamat sands, which have not previously been produced on the Central block.\nThe primary target of the CR-3 well was the Herrera sands, which are prevalent within the Carapal Ridge pool. CR-3 is the first well drilled into the Carapal Ridge pool in the past 17 years and encountered approximately 1,000 feet of net Herrera sand. The well targeted Herrera sands within the developed reservoir section currently on production above a 30-foot shale marker, as well as unproduced Herrera sands below the shale marker. The lower sands were previously completed and tested, but not produced, by a prior operator in the offsetting Carapal Ridge-1 well. These completion tests, known as tests 4, 5 and 6, flow tested at combined peak average daily test rates of over 20 million cubic feet of natural gas and 500 barrels of condensate for periods of approximately one to two days.\nCR-3 encountered approximately 635 feet of net sand in the developed Herrera reservoir at depths between 6,930 feet and 7,770 feet above the shale marker and approximately 365 feet of net Herrera sand below the shale marker within the unproduced reservoir at depths between 7,770 feet and 8,200 feet. Although drilling was terminated at 8,200 feet, the well remained within clean sand at total depth. In addition to the Herrera sands, approximately 82 feet of net Karamat sands were also encountered directly above the Herrara formation at depths between 6,530 feet and 6,760 feet. These Karamat sands are also present in the Carapal Ridge-1 and Carapal Ridge-2 wells.\nThe well was originally planned as a deviated well targeting the Herrera sands; however, during drilling, the well naturally built angle in the production section and approximately 341 feet was drilled horizontally into the unproduced Herrera sand package, optimizing reservoir exposure. Open-hole wireline logging, mud logging, and drilling data collectively indicate the presence of hydrocarbon-bearing sands throughout the Herrera interval, extending to and including the end of the horizontal section.\nCompletion operations are underway at CR-3. The Company intends to initially produce the undeveloped Herrera sands from the horizontal section of the well below the shale marker, while the uphole developed Herrera sands may be perforated at a later date. Much of the CR-3 facility tie-in equipment has been procured and is currently in Trinidad, with tie-in to the Central block natural gas processing facility targeted for the first quarter of 2026.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nThe CR-3 well is our inaugural development well on the Central block and the first well drilled on the field in over 17 years. The well was executed successfully by our drilling team and represents our first horizontal well drilled into the Herrera reservoir.\nAs anticipated, CR-3 encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands both below and above a key shale marker. We intend to initially produce from the lower horizontal section of the well, with significant volumes of uphole sands available for potential future perforation. While the well has resulted in thick pay zone across multiple horizons, the ultimate deliverability will not be known until the well is completed and tied into the facility. Several variables will influence performance, including the fact that the formation has not previously been produced from a horizontal well and the management of downhole pressures.\nImportantly, the well has confirmed both the seismic model and the areal extent of a thick Herrera section. These results are encouraging and support the potential for three additional Herrera wells on the block. The well has also established a second gas-charged play in the Karamat formation at approximately 6,700 feet, which is now being evaluated as a stand-alone prospect for future drilling. We look forward to tying CR-3 into our Central block facility in the quarter to enhance our natural gas sales volumes and realized pricing under our two liquefied natural gas marketing arrangements.\n\"\nTouchstone Exploration Inc.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc. is a Calgary, Alberta-based company engaged in the business of acquiring interests in petroleum and natural gas rights and the exploration, development, production and sale of petroleum and natural gas.

(\"Touchstone\", \"we\", \"our\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nprovides an operational update on the Carapal Ridge-3 development well (\"CR-3\"), located on the Central block onshore in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\nTouchstone holds a 65 percent operating working interest in the well, with Heritage Petroleum Company Limited holding the remaining 35 percent.\nHighlights\nCR-3 is the first well drilled into the Carapal Ridge pool in the past 17 years and encountered approximately 1,082 feet of net sand, including approximately 1,000 feet of net Herrera sand.\nOpen-hole wireline logging, mud logging, and drilling data collectively indicate the presence of hydrocarbon-bearing sands throughout the Herrera interval.\nThe well encountered a thick pay zone across multiple Herrera horizons, both above and below a shale marker.\nCompletion operations are underway, with tie-in to the Central block natural gas processing facility targeted for the first quarter of 2026.\nThe well results support the potential for up to three additional Herrera development wells on the Central block.\nCR-3 also established a second, uphole, gas-charged play in the Karamat formation, which is being evaluated as a stand-alone prospect for potential drilling.\nThe CR-3 well was spud on November 23, 2025, using Star Valley Drilling Rig #205 and was drilled to a total depth of 8,200 feet over a 35-day period. Following open-hole logging operations, the well was cased for future production. Based on initial field-level cost estimates, the well was approximately 25 percent over budget and did not require any sidetrack operations. The additional time and costs were primarily attributable to efforts required to control natural gas flows from the Karamat sands, which have not previously been produced on the Central block.\nThe primary target of the CR-3 well was the Herrera sands, which are prevalent within the Carapal Ridge pool. CR-3 is the first well drilled into the Carapal Ridge pool in the past 17 years and encountered approximately 1,000 feet of net Herrera sand. The well targeted Herrera sands within the developed reservoir section currently on production above a 30-foot shale marker, as well as unproduced Herrera sands below the shale marker. The lower sands were previously completed and tested, but not produced, by a prior operator in the offsetting Carapal Ridge-1 well. These completion tests, known as tests 4, 5 and 6, flow tested at combined peak average daily test rates of over 20 million cubic feet of natural gas and 500 barrels of condensate for periods of approximately one to two days.\nCR-3 encountered approximately 635 feet of net sand in the developed Herrera reservoir at depths between 6,930 feet and 7,770 feet above the shale marker and approximately 365 feet of net Herrera sand below the shale marker within the unproduced reservoir at depths between 7,770 feet and 8,200 feet. Although drilling was terminated at 8,200 feet, the well remained within clean sand at total depth. In addition to the Herrera sands, approximately 82 feet of net Karamat sands were also encountered directly above the Herrara formation at depths between 6,530 feet and 6,760 feet. These Karamat sands are also present in the Carapal Ridge-1 and Carapal Ridge-2 wells.\nThe well was originally planned as a deviated well targeting the Herrera sands; however, during drilling, the well naturally built angle in the production section and approximately 341 feet was drilled horizontally into the unproduced Herrera sand package, optimizing reservoir exposure. Open-hole wireline logging, mud logging, and drilling data collectively indicate the presence of hydrocarbon-bearing sands throughout the Herrera interval, extending to and including the end of the horizontal section.\nCompletion operations are underway at CR-3. The Company intends to initially produce the undeveloped Herrera sands from the horizontal section of the well below the shale marker, while the uphole developed Herrera sands may be perforated at a later date. Much of the CR-3 facility tie-in equipment has been procured and is currently in Trinidad, with tie-in to the Central block natural gas processing facility targeted for the first quarter of 2026.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nThe CR-3 well is our inaugural development well on the Central block and the first well drilled on the field in over 17 years. The well was executed successfully by our drilling team and represents our first horizontal well drilled into the Herrera reservoir.\nAs anticipated, CR-3 encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands both below and above a key shale marker. We intend to initially produce from the lower horizontal section of the well, with significant volumes of uphole sands available for potential future perforation. Whil",

(\n\"\nTouchstone\n\", \"we\", \"our\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\"\n) (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nreports its financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nSelected financial information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with Touchstone's September 30, 2025 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related Management's discussion and analysis, both of which are available online on the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n) and website (\nwww.touchstoneexploration.com\n). Unless otherwise stated, all financial amounts presented\nherein are in\nUnited States dollars\n.\nThird Quarter 2025 Highlights\n\u00b7\nProduction:\nAveraged 5,141 boe/d in the third quarter of 2025 (71 percent natural gas), compared to 4,399 boe/d (69 percent natural gas) in the second quarter of 2025 and 5,211 boe/d (75 percent natural gas) in the third quarter of 2024. Central volumes contributed approximately 2,217 boe/d during the third quarter.\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Sales:\nTotaled $12.70 million, a 4 percent decrease from $13.25 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter.\n-\nCrude oil sales: $5.84 million from average production of 1,051 bbls/d at an average realized price of $60.30 per barrel.\n-\nNGL sales: $1.34 million from average production volumes of 436 bbls/d at an average realized price of $33.41 per barrel.\n-\nNatural gas sales: $5.52 million from average production of 21.9 MMcf/d (3,654 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.74 per Mcf.\n\u00b7\nOperating Netback:\nGenerated $5.86 million in operating netback, a 21 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas operating expenses.\n\u00b7\nFunds Flow from Operations:\nDeclined to $0.74 million from $3.02 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks, higher cash finance expenses, and increased current income taxes, partially offset by lower transaction costs.\n\u00b7\nNet Loss:\nRecorded a net loss of $2.06 million ($0.01 per share) compared to net earnings of $1.85 million ($0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations, $1.50 million in additional depletion and depreciation expense, and the absence of a $0.78 million gain on asset disposition recognized in the prior year.\n\u00b7\nCapital Investments:\nInvested $9.60 million with the majority of expenditures focused on Cascadura drilling operations and the procurement of compression equipment for the Cascadura natural gas processing facility.\n\u00b7\nConvertible Debt Financing:\nIssued a three-year secured convertible debenture (the \"Debenture\") on August 8, 2025, bearing interest at 5 percent per annum to a private investor. The Debenture is convertible at approximately US$0.22 (C$0.30) per share and the investor received 6,250,000 warrants exercisable at C$0.40 per share for two years. Proceeds from the financing supported the completion of the Company's Cascadura development drilling activities.\n\u00b7\nFinancial Position:\nNet debt increased to $77.75 million at September 30, 2025, reflecting the issuance of the Debenture.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Disposition:\nEntered into an agreement to divest the non-core Fyzabad property to a Trinidad-based third party for consideration of three turnkey drilling wells on the Company's WD-8 and WD-4 blocks. The property contributed average production of 49 bbls/d during the third quarter of 2025, with $2.59 million in net liabilities classified as held for sale at September 30, 2025. The transaction remains subject to customary regulatory approvals.\nPost Period-end Highlights\n\u00b7\nPrivate Placement:\nOn October 30, 2025, Touchstone raised gross proceeds of approximately $9.1 million\n(\u00a37 million)\nfrom the issuance of 63,636,363 common shares at 11\npence sterling (approximately C$0.205) per share.\n\u00b7\nBank Waiver Obtained:\nFollowing completion of the October private placement, Touchstone received a waiver from its lender, which waives the testing of the debt service coverage financial covenant under its loan agreement for the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\u00b7\nProduction Update:\nField-estimated production for October 2025 averaged 4,691 boe/d, a 3.3 percent decrease from 4,852 boe/d in September. The decline primarily reflected approximately two days of planned maintenance at the Central facility. Estimated October production volumes comprised 19.7 MMcf/d of net natural gas production (3,289 boe/d) and 1,402 bbls/d of net crude oil and liquids production.\n\u00b7\nDrilling Update:\nThe drilling rig is currently being mobilized to the newly constructed Central block location to drill a well targeting a previously identified natural gas zone with bypassed pay potential.

(\"Touchstone\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP) announces that it has conditionally raised \u00a3\n6.32\nmillion (approximately US$\n8.44 million\n) by way of a private placement of\n57,454,545 new common shares in the Company with\nno par value (\"Common Shares\") to certain new and existing investors (the \"Placing\") at a price of 11 pence (approximately C$0.206) per Common Share (the \"Placing Price\").\nThe Company is proposing to raise up to an additional \u00a3\n0.68 million\nbefore expenses (approximately US$\n0.91 million\n) by way of a retail offer to its existing shareholders via the Bookbuild Platform (the \"Retail Offer\") of up to\n6,181,818\nnew Common Shares at the Placing Price (together with the Common Shares issuable under the Placing, the \"Offered Shares\"). A separate announcement will be made regarding the Retail Offer and its terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Placing is separate from, and does not form part of, the Retail Offer.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Placing, together with any funds raised under the Retail Offer, to continue its revised 2025 capital program and to satisfy the remaining equity raising requirement\nunder the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with Republic Bank Limited (the \"Loan Agreement\").\nFurther Details of the Placing\nPursuant to the Placing, a new investor, Purebond Limited, and certain existing investors have agreed to subscribe for\n57,454,545 new Common Shares at the Placing Price, to raise\ngross proceeds of \u00a3\n6.32\nmillion (approximately US$\n8.44\nmillion). The Placing Price represents a\n2.2\npercent discount to\n11.25\npence, which was the closing price of the Common Shares on the AIM market (\"AIM\") of the London Stock Exchange on October\n23, 2025.\nPurebond Limited is a UK registered entity controlled and managed by the Kansagra family. A condition of Purebond's participation in the Placing is that it receives the right to appoint one nominated non-executive director to the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") while its interest in the Company's total issued share capital remains above 15 percent. Accordingly, the Company has entered into an investor rights agreement with Purebond Limited which confers the Board appointment right. Subject to completion of standard regulatory due diligence, Purebond Limited has indicated that it intends to nominate Bhupendra Kansagra, a director of Purebond Limited, as its Board nominee. A further announcement will be made in this respect in due course.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds from the Placing and the Retail Offer are expected to be used to fund the Company's revised 2025 capital program, as outlined below. The planned expenditures include drilling one development well on the Company's Central block and capital investments related to the Cascadura natural gas facility compression project, which is scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2026.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nThis financing fully satisfies our outstanding obligations under our Loan Agreement, positioning us to advance our 2025 capital investment program focused on high-return projects, including drilling on the recently acquired Central block and the installation of the Cascadura compressor.\nWe are grateful for the continued support of our existing investors and are pleased to welcome Purebond as a significant new shareholder in Touchstone. This strategic investment strengthens our financial position and adds valuable expertise to our Board through the appointment of Mr. Kansagra, a UK-based director with extensive experience in the resource sector and capital markets.\n\"\nAdmission of the Offered Shares\nApplication has been",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, SUCH INFORMATION WILL NO LONGER CONSTITUTE INSIDE INFORMATION.\nCASCADURA-4ST2 X WELL DRILLING RESULTS And operations update\nCALGARY, ALBERTA (September 29, 2025) - Touchstone Exploration Inc. (\"Touchstone\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nprovides an operational update on its Ortoire block activities, including drilling results from the Cascadura-4 development well (\"Cas-4ST2X\").\nCas-4ST2X Well Results\nOperations at Cascadura-4ST2 resumed on August 16, 2025, utilizing Star Valley Drilling Rig #205, and the well reached a total depth of 5,896 feet on September 22, 2025. The well, now designated Cascadura-4ST2X, was originally programmed to evaluate the Herrera Gr7bc sands to a depth of approximately 6,100 feet. However, after encountering gas-charged sands in the lower portion of the well, circulation was lost, leading the Company to conclude drilling operations earlier than planned.\nDuring the pull-out, the drill string became stuck and, despite extensive recovery efforts, could not be freed. The Company has elected to complete the well for production using a combination of casing and the drill string, enabling access to the gas-charged intervals identified while drilling. Although open-hole logs could not be acquired, offset well data and real-time drilling information confirm that the well intersected Herrera Gr7bc sands consistent with the Company's geological model.\nThe primary objective of the well was the Herrera Gr7bc sands, which are widespread across the Cascadura structure. Cascadura-4ST2X represents the third well drilled into the \"A\" block of Cascadura to encounter sands within the targeted reservoir.\nCascadura Development\nCompletion operations on the Cascadura-5 well will immediately commence. All tie-in equipment is on location and the well will be tested directly through the Cascadura natural gas facility following completion. Cas-4ST2X will undergo final completion and tie-in once equipment and a service rig are on site.\nFollowing completion of Pad B operations, the drilling rig will move to the Central block location identified as Carapal Ridge-3 (\"CR-3\"), where site construction is approximately 60 percent complete. The location is expected to be drill-ready by the end of October.\nIn parallel, the Company has secured a compressor for the Cascadura facility to further enhance natural gas processing. The project is currently expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nWith drilling complete on Pad B at Cascadura, we are moving rapidly into the completion and tie-in phase.\nWhile Cas-4ST2X presented challenges due to re-entering a previous wellbore, the systems implemented on the Cas-5 well have proven effective. We remain confident in our ability to drive repeatable cost and efficiency gains at Cascadura and across our Central block program.\n\"\nProduction update\nProduction volumes averaged 5,152 boe/d in August 2025, compared with 5,300 boe/d in July and 5,088 boe/d in June. August volumes comprised 21.7 MMcf/d of net natural gas production (3,623 boe/d) and 1,529 bbls/d of net crude oil and liquids production.\nStrategic Divestiture\nTouchstone has entered into a sale and purchase agreement to dispose of its non-core Fyzabad oil property to a third-party Trinidad-based company. Fyzabad averaged 37 bbls/d of net production in August 2025 and had limited scalability within the Company's portfolio.\nTransaction consideration consists of three turnkey drilling wells to be drilled across Touchstone's WD-8 and WD-4 blocks. Under the agreement, the purchaser will drill the wells while Touchstone supplies certain ancillary drilling and completion equipment.\nTwo wells are currently scheduled for drilling before year-end 2025, with the third well planned for the first quarter of 2026. Closing of the Fyzabad disposition is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to customary regulatory approvals.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc. is a Calgary, Alberta based company engaged in the business of acquiring interests in petroleum and natural gas rights and the exploration, development, production and sale of petroleum and natural gas.

(\n\"\nTouchstone\n\", \"we\", \"our\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\"\n) (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nreports its financial and operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025.\nSelected financial information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with Touchstone's June 30, 2025 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related Management's discussion and analysis, both of which are available online on SEDAR+ (\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n) and on our website (\nwww.touchstoneexploration.com\n). Unless otherwise stated, all financial amounts presented\nherein are in\nUnited States dollars\n.\nSecond Quarter 2025 Highlights\n\u00b7\nStrategic Acquisition\n: Completed the acquisition of\nShell Trinidad Central Block Limited, adding approximately 1,910 boe/d of liquids-rich natural gas production and providing access to global LNG pricing.\n\u00b7\nProduction:\nAveraged 4,399 boe/d in the second quarter of 2025 (69 percent natural gas), compared to 4,317 boe/d (72 percent natural gas) in the first quarter of 2025 and 5,432 boe/d (77 percent natural gas) in the second quarter of 2024. Second quarter 2025 volumes include approximately 1.5 months of production from the Central block acquisition, which contributed approximately 1,910 boe/d over the post-acquisition period.\n\u00b7\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Sales:\nTotaled $11.01 million, a 22 percent decrease from $14.1 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter.\n-\nCrude oil sales: $6.08 million from average production of 1,142 bbls/d at an average realized price of $58.52 per barrel.\n-\nNGL sales: $0.68 million from average production volumes of 210 bbls/d at an average realized price of $35.40 per barrel.\n-\nNatural gas sales: $4.25 million from average production of 18.3 MMcf/d (3,047 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.55 per Mcf.\n\u00b7\nOperating Netback:\nGenerated $5.04 million in operating netback, a 38 percent decrease from the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas related operating expenses.\n\u00b7\nFunds Flow from Operations:\nDeclined to $1.43 million from $3.97 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks and increased cash finance expenses, partially offset by lower current income tax.\n\u00b7\nNet Loss:\nRecorded a net loss of $0.71 million ($0.00 per share) compared to net earnings of $3.34 million ($0.01 per share) in the second quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations and a $1.5 million gain on asset disposition recorded in the prior year.\n\u00b7\nCapital Investments:\nInvested $4.66 million, primarily directed toward the drilling of the Cascadura-5 development well.\n\u00b7\nPrivate Placement:\nRaised net proceeds of $5.22 million in the quarter from the issuance of 24,636,585 common shares at 20.5\npence sterling (approximately C$0.38) per share.\n\u00b7\nFinancial Position:\nNet debt increased to $63.89 million at June 30, 2025, reflecting the close of the Central block acquisition which was funded by an additional $30 million term loan facility.\nPost Period-end Highlights\n\u00b7\nConvertible Debenture Offering:\nOn August 13, 2025, the Company closed a $12.5 million private placement of convertible debentures and common share purchase warrants (the \"Offering\") with a Canadian private investor. Net proceeds will fund the remaining 2025 Cascadura development drilling program and reduce outstanding accounts payable. The Company has received written confirmation from its lender that the Offering proceeds satisfy an equivalent portion of the equity raise requirement under its Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement\n(the \"Loan Agreement\")\n.\n\u00b7\nProduction Update:\nJuly 2025 field-estimated production averaged 5,281 boe/d, up 3.8 percent from 5,088 boe/d in June. Estimated volumes included 22.3 MMcf/d of net natural gas production (3,717 boe/d) and 1,564 bbls/d of net crude oil and liquids production.\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Results Overview\nThree months ended June 30,\n% change\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n% change\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperational\nAverage daily production\nCrude oil(1)\n(bbls/d)\n1,142\n1,158\n(1)\n1,152\n1,162\n(1)\nNGLs(1)\n(bbls/d)\n210\n101\n100\n125\n181\n(31)\nCrude oil and liquids(1)\n(bbls/d)\n1,352\n1,259\n7\n1,277\n1,343\n(5)\nNatural gas(1)\n(Mcf/d)\n18,282\n25,036\n(27)\n18,489\n29,279\n(37)\nAverage daily production\n(boe/d)\n(2)\n4,399\n5,432\n(19)\n4,359\n6,223\n(30)\nProduction mix\n(% of production)\nCrude oil and liquids(1)\n31\n23\n29\n22\nNatural gas(1)\n69\n77\n71\n78\nAverage realized prices(3)\nCrude oil(1)\n($/bbl)\n58.52\n73.62\n(21)\n61.20\n71.78\n(15)\nNGLs(1)\n($/bbl)\n35.40\n73.86\n(52)\n39.80\n70.78\n(44)\nCrude oil and liquids(1)\n($/bbl)\n54.93\n73.64\n(25)\n59.11\n71.64\n(17)\nNatural gas(1)\n($/Mcf)\n2.55\n2.48\n3\n",

(the \"Company\" or \"Touchstone\") announces that it has closed a private placement of a secured convertible debenture and warrants (the \"Offering\"), with Canadian private investor and existing shareholder, JJR Wood Holdings Inc. (the \"Holder\"), for gross proceeds of US$12,500,000. The Offering reflects the Company's ongoing commitment to advancing its strategic development initiatives.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nThis financing will provide the capital necessary to immediately restart drilling operations at Cascadura and subsequently bring new production online at the Cascadura facility. We are pleased to have secured continued support from both an existing shareholder and our Trinidad-based lender, reflecting confidence in our strategic direction and the quality of our asset base. This confidence is further demonstrated by the debenture's principal conversion price, set at the US dollar equivalent of C$0.30 per common share, representing a significant premium to the current share price.\n\"\nOffering Terms\n\u00b7\nOffering Size:\nUS$12,500,000 through the issuance of a secured convertible debenture with an aggregate principal amount of US$12,500,000 (the \"Debenture\").\n\u00b7\nInterest Payments (Coupon) and Securities Offered:\nThe interest rate on the Debenture is 5 percent and the Company also issued 6,250,000 warrants (the \"Warrants\") to purchase common shares of the Company (\"Common Shares\") to the Holder as additional compensation.\n\u00b7\nMaturity:\n3-year term.\n\u00b7\nConversion Price:\nThe Debenture is convertible into Common Shares at US$0.21813 (the \"Conversion Price\"), being the US$ equivalent of C$0.30 per Common Share based on the Bank of Canada exchange rate immediately prior to the issuance of the Debenture.\n\u00b7\nWarrants:\nEach Warrant is exercisable at C$0.40 per Common Share for a period of two years.\n\u00b7\nClosing Date:\nAugust 13, 2025, with an effective date for the Debenture of August 8, 2025.

The acquired entity, now renamed Touchstone Trinidad Central Block Ltd., holds a 65 percent operating interest in the onshore Central Block exploration and production licence. Heritage Petroleum Company Limited holds the remaining 35 percent participating interest. The Central Block asset includes four producing natural gas wells and a gas processing facility. Financial and operational results from the acquired entity have been consolidated into the Company's financial statements from the May 16, 2025 acquisition date.\nProduction Update\nGross production volumes from the Central Block averaged 2,969 boe/d (1,930 boe/d net) during the first quarter of 2025, comprising approximately 16.74 MMcf/d of natural gas and 179 bbls/d of NGLs.\nBased on preliminary field estimates, second quarter 2025 gross production averaged 3,023 boe/d (1,965 boe/d net), comprised of approximately 17.05 MMcf/d of natural gas and 181 bbls/d of NGLs.\nSales and Pricing Update\nNatural gas from the Central Block is sold under two separate contracts: one linked to LNG export pricing and the other to domestic market pricing, primarily supplying Trinidad's petrochemical sector. LNG sales are subject to vessel availability, referred to as liftings.\nFrom January through April 2025, eleven LNG liftings (including associated liquids) were completed, totaling 2,207,696 MMBtu. An additional 11,065 MMBtu was sold into the domestic market. These volumes generated gross revenue of $13.6 million ($8.9 million net). After transportation and processing costs, gross revenue totaled $8.9 million ($5.8 million net). The Central Block also generated $1.0 million in gross revenues ($0.65 million net) from condensate sales at the facility, resulting in total gross revenue of $9.9 million ($6.4 million net) for the period. All sales volumes are subject to a 12.5 percent state royalty and applicable plant operating costs.\nThe LNG liftings and associated liquids achieved an average realized price of $6.15 per MMBtu, translating to a plant gate price of $4.00 per MMBtu after deductions. Domestic sales achieved an average net plant gate price of $4.33 per MMBtu. Condensate was sold at an average price of $48.49 per barrel.\nDevelopment Activities\nTouchstone has completed site surveys for two additional well pads, each capable of supporting up to four drilling locations. The Company is currently awaiting government construction approvals.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nWe are pleased to provide our first operational update on the Central Block following the successful completion of the acquisition. Since the completion, we have delivered quarter-over-quarter production growth through continued plant optimization - an excellent achievement by our Central Block team.\nThis update also highlights the strategic advantage of integrating LNG-based pricing into our marketing portfolio. With commercial documentation complete and the first LNG payment expected by the end of July, we are positioned to benefit from predictable cash flows under the export contract.\nThe Central Block's strong performance supports our acquisition rationale and enhances our marketing flexibility, diversifying revenue streams across LNG, petrochemical, and fixed-price gas sales.\n\"\nTouchstone Exploration Inc.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc. is a Calgary, Alberta based company engaged in the business of acquiring interests in petroleum and natural gas rights and the exploration, development, production and sale of petroleum and natural gas.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, SUCH INFORMATION WILL NO LONGER CONSTITUTE INSIDE INFORMATION.\nCASCADURA-5 WELL DRILLING RESULTS\nCALGARY, ALBERTA (July 7, 2025) - Touchstone Exploration Inc. (\"Touchstone\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nprovides an operational update on the Cascadura-5 development well (\"Cas-5\"), located on the Ortoire block onshore in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\nTouchstone has an 80 percent operating working interest in the well, with Heritage Petroleum Company Limited holding the remaining 20 percent.\nThe Cas-5 well was spud on June 4, 2025, using Star Valley Drilling Rig #205 and was drilled to a total depth of 7,020 feet over 22 days. Following open-hole logging operations, the well was cased for future production.\nThe primary target of the Cas-5 well was the Herrera Gr7bc sands, which are prevalent in the Cascadura structure. Cas-5 is the second well drilled into the B block of the Cascadura structure and encountered approximately 620 feet of gross sand. The targeted reservoir intervals were observed approximately 300 feet updip of the Cascadura-2 well, which was drilled in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe original planned total depth of the well was 6,654 feet. Based on encouraging drill cuttings and mud logging data indicating continued hydrocarbon presence, drilling was extended to 7,020 feet. Wireline logging, mud logging, and drill cuttings data collectively suggest that hydrocarbon-bearing sands are present throughout the primary Gr7bc interval.\nWhen funding is available, the drilling rig is expected to be mobilized to complete operations at the nearby Cascadura-4 well (\"Cas-4\"), which is currently cased to a depth of 3,200 feet. Cas-4 is also targeting the Herrera sands, with a planned total depth of approximately 6,500 feet.\nUpon drilling Cas-4, the Company intends to complete and tie-in Cas-4 and Cas-5 into the Cascadura natural gas facility. All required tie-in equipment is currently on location.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nCas-5 was drilled on schedule and on budget, with field-estimated costs of approximately US$5 million, despite extending the target depth. The performance of our new drilling team, along with the use of synthetic oil-based mud and managed pressure drilling, was instrumental in delivering a successful operation. We encountered no material issues during drilling, which we attribute to improvements implemented following previous challenges. The hydrocarbon intervals observed align with or exceed our pre-drill expectations and continue to enhance our understanding of the Cascadura structure as we integrate ongoing seismic interpretation.\n\"\nPlacing update\nThe Company continues to evaluate its options regarding the unfunded placing commitments and will issue a further announcement as soon as practicable.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc. is a Calgary, Alberta based company engaged in the business of acquiring interests in petroleum and natural gas rights and the exploration, development, production and sale of petroleum and natural gas.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, SUCH INFORMATION WILL NO LONGER CONSTITUTE INSIDE INFORMATION.\nPRIVATE PLACEMENT UPDATE\nCALGARY, ALBERTA (June 30, 2025) - Touchstone Exploration Inc. (\"Touchstone\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP) provides an update regarding its previously announced private placement arranged by Portillion Capital\nAsset Management Limited (\"Portillion\")\nand Oak Securities (the\n\"Placement\").\nAs disclosed in the Company's announcement on June 23, 2025, and notwithstanding repeated assurances from Portillion and Oak Securities, \u00a310,324,500 of the \u00a315,375,000 gross proceeds from the Placement have not been received. This includes \u00a310,000,000 relating to Portillion's subscription commitment.\nAs previously announced on May 16, 2025, the Company issued 75,000,000 new common shares to the settlement agent acting on behalf of OAK Securities for distribution to placees under the Placement. The extended deadline to complete the Placement under the conditional approval granted by the Toronto Stock Exchange (the\n\"TSX\") expired on June 27, 2025. Consequently, Touchstone closed on the \u00a35,050,500 of gross proceeds received as of that date, completing the issuance of 24,636,586 common shares, subject to receipt by the TSX of customary post-closing materials which the Company expects to deliver today.\nThe remaining 50,363,414 new common shares, which remain with the settlement agent pending receipt of the outstanding funds, will be cancelled.\nFollowing the cancellation, the Company's issued share capital and total voting rights will consist of 261,097,247 common shares.\nThe Company does not hold any common shares in treasury. This figure may be used by shareholders to determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or any change to their interest in, the Company.\nThe Company is reviewing its options in respect of Portillion's failure to fulfill its subscription commitment under the Placement.\nTouchstone remains focused on securing the funding necessary to continue its 2025 capital program, including meeting its obligations under the fourth amended and restated loan agreement with Republic Bank Limited (the \"Loan Agreement\").\nWhile there can be no guarantee that the outstanding Placement proceeds will be received, the Company intends to submit a new application to the TSX for conditional approval of a further issuance of new common shares, enabling completion of Portillion's subscription should the funds be forthcoming.\nUnder\nthe terms of the Loan Agreement, in addition to the amount that has settled to date pursuant to the Placement,\nTouchstone is required to raise not less than approximately US$18 million in equity proceeds on or before December 31, 2025, or such later date as may be agreed with the lender.\"\n. Following the completion of drilling the Cascadura-5 well, the Company will defer further activity under its 2025 capital program. Considering whether the outstanding Placement funds are ultimately received, Touchstone will evaluate financing options in the near term to satisfy the requirements of the Loan Agreement in relation to the raising of equity capital, and to be able to resume its 2025 capital program.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc. is a Calgary, Alberta based company engaged in the business of acquiring interests in petroleum and natural gas rights and the exploration, development, production and sale of petroleum and natural gas.

Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, forecasts, estimates, expectations and objectives for future operations that are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company.

Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks.

(\n\"\nTouchstone\n\", \"we\", \"our\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\"\n) (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nreports its operating and condensed financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025.\nSelected financial information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with our March 31, 2025 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related Management's discussion and analysis, both of which are available online under our profile on SEDAR+ (\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n) and on our website (\nwww.touchstoneexploration.com\n). Unless otherwise stated, all financial amounts presented\nherein are in\nUnited States dollars\n, and all\nproduction volumes disclosed herein are sales volumes based on Company working interest before royalty burdens.\nFirst Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Highlights\n\u00b7\nProduction:\nAverage quarterly production decreased to 4,317 boe/d (72 percent natural gas), compared to 5,287 boe/d (73 percent natural gas) in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 7,015 boe/d (80 percent natural gas) in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by natural declines in natural gas and liquids production from the Cascadura-1ST1 and Cascadura Deep-1 wells, partially offset by incremental volumes from the Cascadura-2ST1 and Cascadura-3ST1 wells which began production in November 2024.\n\u00b7\nRevenue:\nPetroleum and natural gas sales totaled $11.11 million, an 18 percent reduction from the $13.54 million recorded in the previous quarter.\n-\nCrude oil sales: $6.68 million from average production of 1,162 bbls/d at a realized price of $63.86 per barrel.\n-\nNGL sales: $0.22 million from average production of 39 bbls/d at a realized price of $64.05 per barrel.\n-\nNatural gas sales: $4.21 million from average production of 18.7 MMcf/d (3,116 boe/d) at a realized price of $2.50 per Mcf.\n\u00b7\nOperating Netback:\nGenerated $6.15 million in operating netback, an 11 percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties, partially offset by a 38 percent reduction in operating costs, supported in part by revisions to historical crude oil field head licence expenses.\n\u00b7\nFunds Flow from Operations:\nDecreased to $2.58 million from $3.61 million in the previous quarter, as lower operating netbacks and higher cash finance and general and administrative expenses were partially offset by reduced transaction and current income tax expenses.\n\u00b7\nNet Earnings:\nRecorded net earnings of $41,000 ($0.00 per basic and diluted share), compared to a net loss of $542,000 ($0.00 per basic share) in the fourth quarter of 2024 which was primarily driven by both $2.31 million in pre-tax Ortoire exploration asset impairment expenses and higher depletion expenses recorded in the prior quarter following Cascadura reserves reductions.\n\u00b7\nCapital Investments:\nInvested $6.67 million during the quarter, primarily for the Cascadura-4 development well.

(\n\"\nTouchstone\n\", \"we\", \"our\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\"\n) (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nreports its operating and condensed financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024.\nSelected financial information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with our December 31, 2024 audited consolidated financial statements and related Management's discussion and analysis, both of which are available under our profile on SEDAR+ (\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n) and on our website (\nwww.touchstoneexploration.com\n). Unless otherwise stated, all financial amounts presented\nherein are in\nUnited States dollars\n, and all\nproduction volumes disclosed herein are sales volumes based on Company working interest before royalty burdens.\nPaul Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nIn 2024, Touchstone maintained its growth trajectory, achieving record annual production and delivering net earnings, driven by a full year of Cascadura production. We successfully drilled, completed, and brought online two wells at the Cascadura C pad, alongside the installation of a new natural gas separator. With most infrastructure now in place, we are well-positioned to accelerate the transition from drilling to production for future wells.\nWe continued expanding our Trinidad onshore acreage and announced a strategic acquisition, which we are actively working to finalize. The amended loan agreement and related security documents are in progress, with completion expected in the second quarter of 2025. Looking ahead, we will strategically evaluate growth opportunities, factoring in natural gas pricing dynamics while leveraging our extensive land portfolio and infrastructure to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Above all, safety remains our top priority, ensuring the well-being of our people and the integrity of our operations.\n\"\nAnnual 2024 Financial and Operating Highlights\n\u00b7\nRecord Production:\nAchieved annual average production volumes of 5,734 boe/d, a 44 percent increase from 3,981 boe/d in 2023. Production consisted of 1,220 bbls/d of crude oil, 132 bbls/d of NGLs, and 26.3 MMcf/d of natural gas.\n\u00b7\nRevenue:\nPetroleum and natural gas sales totaled $57.47 million, up 19 percent from $48.10 million in 2023. The increase was driven by a full year of Cascadura production, with natural gas sales rising 77 percent, partially offset by a 3 percent decline in crude oil and NGL sales.\n\u00b7\nFinancial Performance:\n-\nFunds flow from operations:\n$16.75 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 22 percent from $13.73 million recorded in 2023.\n-\nOperating netback:\n$32.89 million or $15.68 per boe (2023 - $26.22 million or $18.04 per boe).\n-\nNet earnings:\n$8.27 million ($0.04 per basic share, $0.03 per diluted share), compared to a net loss of $20.60 million ($0.09 per basic share) in 2023, which included $21.39 million in net non-financial asset impairment expenses.\n\u00b7\nCapital Program:\nInvested $23.68 million in development and infrastructure, including four gross (3.6 net) development wells and key upgrades to the Cascadura natural gas processing facility.\n\u00b7\nFinancial Position:\nEnded the year with cash of $6.7 million and net debt of $29.11 million, resulting in a net debt-to-funds flow from operations ratio of 1.74 times.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Portfolio Optimization:\n-\nDivested three non-core properties and acquired the Balata East block, which supports Cascadura NGL marketing.\n-\nExpanded onshore Trinidad acreage by approximately 103,000 working interest acres, securing exploration and production licences within the Herra Formation fairway.\n\u00b7\nSafety:\nMaintained a strong focus on responsible operations, with one lost-time injury recorded in 2024.\n\u00b7\nProposed Acquisition:\nIn December 2024, we signed an agreement to acquire full ownership of a Trinidad-based private entity (the \"Proposed Acquisition\"), which holds a\n65 percent operating working interest in the onshore Central Block exploration and production licence, along with four producing natural gas wells and an 80 MMcf/d gas processing plant in Trinidad.\nFourth Quarter 2024 Financial and Operating Highlights\n\u00b7\nProduction:\nAverage quarterly production increased to 5,287 boe/d (73 percent natural gas), compared to 5,211 boe/d (75 percent natural gas) in the third quarter of 2024. The increase reflected incremental output from the Cascadura-2ST1 and Cascadura-3ST1 wells brought online in November 2024, partially offset by natural declines in Cascadura field production.\n\u00b7\nRevenue:\nPetroleum and natural gas sales totaled $13.54 million, consistent with the $13.25 million recorded in the previous quarter.\n-\nCrude oil sales: $7.53 million from average production of 1,310 bbls/d at a realized price of $62.50 per barrel.\n-\nNGL sales: $0.7 million from average production of 121 bbls/d at a realized price of $62.05 per",

(\"GLJ\") with an effective date of December 31, 2024 (the \"Reserves Report\"). Highlights of our total proved developed producing (\"PDP\"), total proved (\"1P\"), and total proved plus probable (\"2P\") reserves from the Reserves Report are provided below. Unless otherwise stated, all financial amounts referenced\nherein are stated in\nUnited States dollars\n.\nReaders are further cautioned to read the applicable advisories contained herein.\nPaul Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"Our year-end 2024 reserves report highlights the substantial potential of our asset base in Trinidad with the NPV10 of future net revenues of 2P reserves valued at approximately $671 million and $309 million on a before tax and after-tax basis, respectively. The combination of our base crude oil production and the early-stage development of our natural gas properties supports our ongoing transition from an exploration-driven company to one focused on predictable production growth.\nThe reserve estimates for this year reflect a material balance assessment approach based on the data collected at Cascadura. This revised methodology, compared to the previous volumetric interpretation, aligns reserve estimates with our forecasted production curves.\nThe addition of light oil reserves from the Cascadura-3ST1 discovery underscores the significant potential of this emerging play. While the current reserves include a limited number of future crude oil drilling locations, we plan to expand this potential through further delineation and development in the Rio Claro block.\nA key highlight of the year is the previously announced acquisition of Shell Trinidad Central Block Limited, which provides access to the lucrative Trinidad liquefied natural gas market. Notably, our year-end 2024 reserves report does not reflect any additional reserves from the proposed acquisition. An independent evaluation of the acquired reserves will be provided following the expected completion of the proposed transaction.\n\"\n2024 Operational Highlights\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully completed the Cascadura C pipeline and facility expansion, increasing processing capacity and supporting future production growth.\n\u00b7\nDrilled and brought onstream the Cascadura-2ST1 and Cascadura-3ST1 wells.\n\u00b7\nAdvanced the development of the CO-1 crude oil block with the drilling and production commencement of the CO-374 and CO-375 wells.\n\u00b7\nDelivered strong performance from our CO-1, WD-4 and WD-8 blocks through targeted infill drilling, optimization programs, and recompletion activities, resulting in notable increases in light and medium crude oil reserves.\n\u00b7\nFourth quarter production was strengthened by the successful startup of the Cascadura-2ST1 and Cascadura-3ST1 development wells, resulting in average quarterly net production of 5,287 boe/d and 2024 annual average net production of 5,734 boe/d.\nYear-end 2024 Reserves Overview and Highlights\nTouchstone's year-end reserves highlight the successful addition of crude oil reserves from the Cascadura-3ST1 discovery, located east of Fault-C, alongside a revision to the natural gas and NGL reserves west of Fault-C at Cascadura. Comprehensive data from the Cascadura field underscores the need for further development drilling to fully realize the natural gas potential. With an established pipeline network and infrastructure in place, the Company is positioned for efficient and cost-effective future development.\n\u00b7\nThe net present value of future net revenues discounted at 10 percent (\"NPV10\") on a before tax 1P basis decreased by 5 percent to $354.4 million and declined by 8 percent to $671 million on a 2P basis from the prior year.\n\u00b7\nRealized after tax 1P NPV10 of $178.8 million represented a decrease of 7 percent from the prior year and after tax 2P NPV10 declined by 10 percent from year-end 2023 to $308.5 million.\n\u00b7\nRelative to year-end 2023 and after 2024 production, gross 1P reserves declined by 14 percent to 29,070 Mboe and gross 2P reserves decreased by 26 percent to 50,063 Mboe in 2024.\n\u00b7\nReductions in our year-end reserves balances from 2023 reflected technical revisions to the natural gas reserves and NGL yields at Cascadura, reserve discoveries at Cascadura-3ST1, positive technical revisions at our crude oil blocks, acquisition and development activities, and increased annual production volumes in 2024.\n\u00b7\nWe continue to maintain an extensive producing reserve life index of 8.7 years 1P and 12.9 years 2P, reflecting the long producing life of our asset base.\n2024 Year-end Reserves Report Summary\nTouchstone's year-end light and medium crude oil, heavy crude oil, conventional natural gas and natural gas liquid reserves in",

(\"Touchstone\", \"we\", \"our\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Touchstone Exploration (Trinidad) Ltd. (\"TETL\"), has entered into an agreement with BG Overseas Holdings Limited to acquire all the share capital of Shell Trinidad Central Block Limited (\"STCBL\") (the \"Acquisition\").\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition, TETL will pay BG Overseas Holdings Limited $23 million consideration in cash prior to closing adjustments. Completion of the Acquisition is subject to customary regulatory and partner approvals, including the approval of the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries. Touchstone is in active discussions with its Trinidad-based lender, Republic Bank Limited, to fund the Acquisition upon closing. The Acquisition will have an effective date of January 1, 2025, has a four-month long stop date, and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2025.\nSTCBL holds a 65 percent operating working interest in the Central block exploration and production licence and gas processing plant in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago with Heritage Petroleum Company Limited (\"HPCL\") holding a 35 percent working interest. Current gross production from the Central block is approximately 18.0 MMcf/d of natural gas and 200 bbls/d of natural gas liquids (approximately 3,200 boe/d).\nAcquisition Highlights\n\u00b7\nAccess to Atlantic LNG\n: STCBL is a party to natural gas sales contracts for the Central block asset, providing access to both local and LNG world gas market pricing.\n\u00b7\nOpportunity for Development\n: Touchstone has identified numerous infill well locations as well as a deeper Cretaceous prospect at Central block.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Infrastructure\n: The midstream assets of STCBL include an 80 MMcf/d gas processing plant (the \"Evergreen Facility\"), field natural gas and liquids flowlines, and a gas export pipeline to both the domestic market and the Atlantic LNG facility.\n\u00b7\nIncreased Production\n: The Acquisition increases Touchstone's base net production by approximately 2,080 boe/d (94 percent natural gas) at current field estimated rates and provides incremental corporate cash flows.\nPaul Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nWe are pleased to enter into an agreement to purchase the Central block asset.\nThe asset is a strategic fit with Touchstone's current land base and provides us access to world LNG prices for natural gas. The infrastructure associated with the assets provides processing and takeaway capacity for natural gas in the Herrera fairway. During 2025 we will consider pursuing an infill development drilling program at Central block and look to boost production and LNG sales.\n\"\nThe Acquisition\nThe Central block assets include four wells in the Carapal Ridge, Baraka, and Baraka East liquids rich natural gas pools. In addition to existing low decline field production, the Central block asset base has facility optimization potential, infill drilling opportunities and exploration prospects.\nSTCBL holds three gas marketing contracts: one accessing the Trinidad domestic market, and two contracts accessing the Atlantic LNG facility in Trinidad. The Central block is situated in the Herrera fairway and is contiguous with Touchstone's Ortoire block, providing strategic potential for natural gas egress and marketing options from future discoveries. Our Coho natural gas production is currently processed at Central block, and the Acquisition provides synergy potential for the field.\nThe Acquisition is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent and customary regulatory approvals, including the Company's ability to receive funding to complete the Acquisition. Hence, no assurances can be given that the Acquisition will ultimately be completed. Due to confidentiality terms in the agreement, Touchstone is not able to provide further information to the market on this Acquisition until the transaction is effectively closed, or terminated, as the case may be.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc.\nTouchstone Exploration Inc. is a Calgary, Alberta based company engaged in the business of acquiring interests in petroleum and natural gas rights and the exploration, development, production and sale of petroleum and natural gas.

(\n\"\nTouchstone\n\", \"we\", \"our\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\"\n) (TSX, LSE: TXP) announces its preliminary annual 2025 capital budget and financial guidance.\nPaul Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nOur 2025 strategy focuses on driving sustainable growth by building on the success of our foundational Cascadura asset. We aim to fully leverage the extensive infrastructure and flowline installations completed in 2024 to unlock the field's potential. Our preliminary 2025 capital budget focuses on executing our \"drill-to-fill\" strategy, which involves drilling four gross Cascadura development wells to increase production and optimize asset performance. This approach will enable us to capitalize on the existing processing capacity established at our Cascadura facility.\nWe intend to fund this program through operating cash flows generated from our assets, complemented by a near-term increase in our debt facilities. With prudent financial management, we expect to exit 2025 with a net debt level consistent with that of 2024, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining financial stability.\nI want to extend my gratitude to our employees, shareholders, and stakeholders for their unwavering support and trust. At Touchstone, we remain dedicated to delivering operational excellence, guided by a culture that prioritizes safety above all else. Building on the achievements of 2024 - including substantial production growth and the expansion of critical infrastructure to enhance operational efficiencies - we are excited to carry this momentum into 2025.\n\"\n2025 Budget Highlights\n\u00b7\nPlanned expansion of debt facilities\n- We plan to increase our existing debt capacity by $10 million in the first quarter of 2025 to manage the forecasted timing of the 2025 capital program. No firm commitment is currently in place with our existing lender.\n\u00b7\nCapital budget allocation\n- We project to invest approximately $23 million in capital expenditures for 2025. Of this, approximately $20 million is expected to be directed toward our Cascadura field. The remaining $3 million is allocated to exploration licence payments and well optimization operations across our crude oil properties.\n\u00b7\nDrilling operations\n- To further optimize our existing Cascadura infrastructure, our preliminary 2025 capital budget includes the drilling of four gross (3.2 net) Cascadura development wells. Two wells are expected to be drilled from pad B in the first quarter of 2025, followed by two additional wells from pad C in the third quarter of 2025.\n\u00b7\nProduction growth\n- We project a mid-point annual average production of 7,000 boe/d for 2025, reflecting an estimated 19 percent increase from our latest 2024 guidance. Annual production is expected to range between 6,700 and 7,300 boe/d, with approximately 77 percent of production being natural gas.\n\u00b7\nFunds flow generation and balance sheet strength\n- Our 2025 budget is projected to generate approximately $22 million in funds flow from operations. This will result in a net debt to annual funds flow from operations ratio of 1.36 times, well within the Company's internal target of 2.0 times or below. Net debt at the end of 2025 is expected to be comparable with our forecasted 2024 closing position, underscoring our commitment to maintaining financial discipline during a period of growth.\n2025 Budget and Guidance Overview\nThe preliminary 2025 capital budget and financial guidance presented herein is contingent on increasing the Company's existing debt capacity by $10 million in the first quarter of 2025. Currently there is no firm commitment from our existing lender, and accordingly, the 2025 budget and preliminary guidance may be subject to change, and such changes may be material. The Company will provide further updates in due course.\nFollowing a 2024 year of growth and land acquisitions, Touchstone's Board of Directors has approved a\npreliminary\n2025 capital budget of $23 million to drill, complete, and tie-in four gross (3.2 net) Cascadura development wells. The Cascadura-4 development well, initially planned for December 2024, has been deferred to the first quarter of 2025 to align with our updated drilling schedule and represents one of the four gross Cascadura development wells.\nThe preliminary 2025 drilling program includes two gross Cascadura development wells to be drilled from the pad B location in the first quarter, with production expected to come online in the second quarter of 2025. Additionally, two more gross wells are planned for the third quarter from t",

(\n\"\nTouchstone\n\", \"we\", \"our\"\nor the\n\"\nCompany\n\"\n) (TSX, LSE: TXP)\nreports financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and updated 2024 guidance.\nSelected financial information is outlined below and should be read in conjunction with our September 30, 2024 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related Management's discussion and analysis, both of which are available under our profile on SEDAR+ (\nwww.sedarplus.ca\n) and on our website (\nwww.touchstoneexploration.com\n). Unless otherwise stated, all financial amounts presented\nherein are rounded to thousands of\nUnited States dollars\n, and all\nproduction volumes disclosed herein are sales volumes based on Company working interest before royalty burdens.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial and Operating Highlights\n\u00b7\nAchieved average quarterly production of 5,211 boe/d (75 percent natural gas), a 54 percent increase relative to 3,391 boe/d produced in the third quarter of 2023 (60 percent natural gas), reflecting a full quarter of natural gas production from the Cascadura field, slightly offset by Cascadura natural gas and associated liquids natural declines.\n\u00b7\nRealized petroleum and natural gas sales of $13,253,000 compared to $11,682,000 in the equivalent quarter of 2023, primarily attributed to a 93 percent increase in natural gas production volumes, slightly offset by a reduction in average realized crude oil and liquids pricing.\n-\nCrude oil production contributed $7,603,000 of petroleum sales at an average realized price of $66.72 per barrel.\n-\nCascadura field production volumes in the quarter contributed $4,908,000 of natural gas sales at an average realized price of $2.50 per Mcf and $306,000 of petroleum sales at an average realized price of $67.15 per barrel.\n-\nNatural gas production from the Coho-1 well contributed $436,000 of natural gas sales in the quarter at an average realized price of $2.16 per Mcf.\n\u00b7\nGenerated an operating netback of $7,408,000, a 23 percent increase from the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties, as well as a 2 percent reduction in operating expenses.\n\u00b7\nAchieved quarterly funds flow from operations of $3,024,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $2,432,000 in the prior year equivalent period, attributed to the increase in operating netback partially offset by $722,000 of transaction costs incurred in the quarter.\n\u00b7\nRecognized net earnings of $1,847,000 ($0.01 per basic and diluted share) compared to net earnings of $988,000 ($0.00 per basic and diluted share) in the comparative quarter of 2023.\n\u00b7\n$3,068,000 in quarterly capital investments primarily focused on the completion of two Cascadura development wells, advancing the construction of the flowline from the Cascadura C site to the Cascadura natural gas processing facility and construction of the Cascadura B drilling pad.\n\u00b7\nExited the third quarter of 2024 with a cash balance of $6,549,000 and a net debt position of $29,593,000\n, resulting in a net debt to annual funds flow from operations ratio of 1.25 times, well within the Company's internal target of 2.0 times or below.\n\u00b7\nTouchstone continued to accumulate Trinidad onshore acreage, executing two exploration and production licences in the third quarter for the Charuma and Cipero blocks.\nPost Period-end Operating Highlights\n\u00b7\nPrimarily based from ongoing declines from our Cascadura-1ST1 and Cascadura-2ST1 wells, as well as the Cascadura facility being shut-in four days to accommodate the tie-in of the Cascadura C flow line and expansion project, we sold average net volumes of 3,993 boe/d in October 2024, comprised of:\n-\naverage natural gas sales volumes of 16.4 MMcf/d (2,726 boe/d); and\n-\naverage crude oil and natural gas liquid sales volumes of 1,267 bbls/d.\n\u00b7\nOn November 2, 2024, we safely commissioned the flowline connecting the Cascadura-2ST1 and Cascadura-3ST1 wells to our natural gas processing plant and commenced production testing operations.\n\u00b7\nWe entered into a minimum six-year exploration and production licence for an 80 percent operating working interest in the Rio Claro block effective November 5, 2024, which is strategically located adjacent to our Ortoire block and surrounds our Balata East field.\n\u00b7\nOn November 9, 2024, production testing of the Cascadura-2ST1 well was completed, with the well placed on continuous production at a choke restricted gross natural gas flow rate of approximately 20 MMcf/d and 400 bbls/d of NGLs.\n\u00b7\nCascadura-3ST1 production testing operations were completed on November 12, 2024, and the Company intends to place the well on permanent production at a choke restricted initial gross rate of approximately 600 to 700 bbls/d of oil.\nFinancial and Operating Result",

(\"Touchstone\", \"we\", \"our\" or the \"Company\") (TSX, LSE: TXP) announces the completion of Cascadura-2ST1 and Cascadura-3ST1 well testing.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nCascadura-2ST1 Well:\nduring an extended 48-hour test, Cascadura-2ST1 produced an average rate of approximately 4,950 boe/d, consisting of 26.4 MMcf/d of natural gas and 547 bbls/d of NGLs.\n\u00b7\nFluid Analysis for Cascadura-2ST1:\ninitial field analysis shows the presence of liquids-rich natural gas with no produced water, similar to the characteristics of the Cascadura-1ST1 well.\n\u00b7\nCascadura-3ST1 Well:\nover a 68-hour testing period, Cascadura-3ST1 achieved an average production rate of approximately 1,100 boe/d, including 786 bbls/d of crude oil and 1.9 MMcf/d of natural gas.\n\u00b7\nFluid Analysis for Cascadura-3ST1:\nfield assessments indicate medium API gravity crude oil with a 2 percent water cut, along with liquids-rich natural gas.\n\u00b7\nProduction Status:\nthe Cascadura-2ST1 well is currently on continuous production to the Cascadura natural gas processing facility, and the Cascadura-3ST1 well is scheduled to commence permanent production within the next two days.\nPaul R. Baay, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"These encouraging well test results not only validate our geological models but also underscore the potential of the Cascadura field. With critical infrastructure in place between the wells, we are well-positioned to drill additional wells to further develop the field.\nThe Cascadura-2ST1 well test results are similar to those of Cascadura-1ST1, and the well is located at the boundary of our reserves booking. The Cascadura-3ST1 well test results are exceptionally promising, as they unlock a new oil and natural gas play on the eastern side of Fault C, extending into the recently acquired Rio Claro block. On a per barrel equivalent basis, oil currently generates nearly five times the revenue of natural gas, and with a 12.5 percent royalty on the block and anticipated operating expenses below our corporate average, the play offers strong cash flow generating capabilities.\nTogether, these wells represent a material increase to our base production, reinforce our development strategy and open the door to a new oil play.\n\"\nCascadura-2ST1 Testing\nCascadura-2ST1 production testing commenced on November 2, 2024, with flow tests spanning a total of 82 hours, comprised of an initial clean-up flow period, followed by an initial shut-in period and a four-step rate test, including a 48-hour extended flow test. All production accumulated during w\nell testing was processed for sales at the Cascadura natural gas processing facility.\nDuring the 48-hour extended portion of the flow test, the well produced at an average rate of approximately 4,950 boe/d (89 percent natural gas), including 26.4 MMcf/d of natural gas and an estimated 547 bbls/d of NGLs. The bottom hole flowing pressure of the well during this stage of testing averaged 3,497 psi through a 64 percent choke, representing a 15 percent reservoir pressure drawdown.\nDuring testing,\nCascadura-2ST1\nyielded 44-degree API gravity NGLs at an average ratio of approximately 21 barrels of NGLs per MMcf of natural gas produced. Field analysis of the produced gas indicated liquids rich natural gas. Additional testing of fluid samples will be conducted to accurately assess the natural gas and associated liquids composition as well as the phase behaviour of the fluids within the reservoir.\nThe well was shut-in for a pressure build-up survey between November 6, 2024 and November 9, 2024 with further analysis to be conducted in identifying reservoir continuity.\nOn November 9, 2024 the\nCascadura-2ST1 well was placed on continuous production at a choke restricted initial natural gas rate of approximately 20 MMcf/d and associated NGLs.\nThis initial choke setting was selected based on well test analysis and is designed to maximize the ultimate recovery of both natural gas and NGLs from this section of the reservoir, ensuring optimal long-term performance.\nCascadura-3ST1 Testing\nCascadura-3ST1 flow testing commenced on November 6, 2024, with all production accumulated during\ntesting processed for sales at the Cascadura natural gas processing facility.\nDuring the 68-hour flow test, the well produced at an average rate of approximately 1,100 boe/d (71 percent oil), including an estimated 786 bbls/d of oil and 1.9 MMcf/d of natural gas. The wellhead flowing pressure during the flow test averaged 1,122 psi through choke settings of 25 percent to 35 percent, representing a 65 percent wellhead pressure drawdown.\nDuring testing,\nCascadura-3ST1\nyielded 29-degree API gravity oil with a 2 percent water cut, as well as liquids rich natural gas.

Yes, folk look at AIM and, particularly if they fall into a nest of rampers on e.g. Discord, convince themselves that AIM is high risk high reward.  The statistics are clear though: AIM is high risk low reward.  There are exceptions now and again where a high reward materialises that nimble traders can bank, but TXP clearly had its moment in the sun years ago and the last few years have been a slow reveal of poor management and poor assets. Look at the ongoing bull market in precious metals.  Look at how mainstream gold and silver plays have performed - it turns out elephants can jump!  Then compare the performance of AIM gold and plays - a few bright spots but much poorer performance on average.  Tells you all you need to know about AIM.",

And \"What are the rough valuation ranges in these scenarios?\"). I also asked GPT to give a prognosis wrt. 2025 and a 2026 guidance, based on RNS's and ERs from 2024 and 2025. I think the answers were interesting. But you can do your own research. And 2026 will rely on CR3 and (according to GPT) >7.000 BOEs per day in total (and we're not getting anywhere with that; that's the minimum grinding level). Not going to paste 20 pages of Q&As here and all the , but the final estimate (based on three scenarios). If you weight the valuation ranges we discussed earlier by these probabilities: Low case (\u00a320\u201340m) \u00d7 20% Medium case (\u00a380\u2013150m) \u00d7 50% High case (\u00a3200\u2013350m+) \u00d7 30% You end up with an expected outcome skewed heavily toward the medium\u2013high range, despite the low case existing. That\u2019s why CR-3 is: Not risk-free But asymmetrically attractive if execution is merely \u201cgood\u201d VAT (Next bit is for Dunder: I thought GPT might not have taken VAT into account. So I asked - just to see the detail of what it learned from browsing ERs. I think it goes deeper than most investors do) \"So in your 2026 forecast, do you consider VAT issues solved?\" Good questions \u2014 they go to the core realism of the 2026 forecast. 1\ufe0f\u20e3 In the 2026 forecast, am I assuming VAT issues are \u201csolved\u201d? Short answer: \ud83d\udc49 Partially solved, but not fully cleared. What I am assuming in the 2026 base case: VAT stops being a worsening problem Some cash inflow occurs VAT no longer dominates liquidity stress Specifically, the 2026 base case assumes: Partial VAT recovery (cash + bond monetisation) VAT receivable shrinks, but does not go to zero Management can plan without VAT uncertainty driving every decision What I am not assuming \u274c I am not assuming: Full VAT repayment in one lump sum Immediate conversion of all VAT bonds into cash That VAT becomes irrelevant to the balance sheet Numerically (roughly) In the 2026 model, VAT implicitly contributes something like: $4\u20136m of liquidity improvement via bond redemption / monetisation plus some cash settlement That is helpful, but: It does not rescue the company on its own The model still requires operating cash flow to do the heavy lifting If VAT is not resolved by 2026 If VAT receipts slip further: Net debt stays $5\u201310m higher Leverage remains elevated So VAT resolution is a supporting pillar, not the foundation.",

Not to mention that their generel cost base and \"employee benefits\" is likely many times bigger than the T&T basis, leading to higher costs at CB than most other companies would accept. With a heli-pad and regional managers doing jet-set leadership, carried over on local, small assets. This is peanuts for them. They're taking down trees, not looking for peanuts. Certainly not peanuts for TXP though. If you want to see a company that did exactly what TXP might do, take a look at #VLE / Valeura. Amazing how much value you can create with extending lifetime and paying a low price for an asset bco. liabilities. Reserve growth and commercial targets... VLE is up 1000% or something over the last couple of years. It's still cheap btw.",

You cannot have it both ways in explaining why they haven't drilled further wells. Ross, I agree the assets are far more complicated. But they have drilled a couple of very good wells in Casc. The issue is that every well is like a coin toss, because contrary to what Lyin Paul says, they don't have a good grip on anything, be it development and execution, or the geology. Some posters were questioning what happens if Casc 4 and 5 are poor only to be shouted down by the Discord experts who pointed to how much 'we know the Casc geology', these were 'safe play' wells, and 'I spoke with Paul' etc. At least now they are a little more restrained in how they respond to people saying Central is not a given until we've seen actual results. We have to hope this time the coin toss is favourable, and that Shell has missed an opportunity over all those years. But to date I haven't heard a single decent reason as to why Shell would have sunk all the capex, and have massive opex relative to sales, when all they have to do is drill a few more $5m wells into a producing field. The logs look good (but so did Casc 4 & 5), and so now we have to wait and hope, as usual with anything these clowns decide to do. Even the compressor has f@ck up written all over it. Something will be missing. Something will go wrong with the installation. The production gains end up being f@ck all. And it all won't be their fault. What exactly is happening with Casc 3 -5 doing right now? No official comms from Calamity Baay who is hiding them away, praying that Central will give him a shiny object to distract the Discord fanboys so they forget about these monumental screw-ups. We'll get these results only when Lyin Paul has something to distract people from what they have done with Casc - 'don't look over there, look over here'. I hesitate to say the bottom is in at 9p and any buyers are now going to have to pay +9.5p over the coming month.",

All non-essential Capex will be stripped, and they will hold on for a year until the pricing contracts change to drill another well or two. The pricing change should get us back to 9-10p in 12 months. If our coin comes up heads, then I do see an immediate re-rate to 14-16p range. They will have enough cash to pay freeloader salaries, debt obligations, and I imagine to drill another 2 Central wells this year. If those wells are also moderately to quite successful, then you suddenly have a profitable, self-sustaining company that can afford to drill all-year round with the odd f@ck up. In 12 months with the pricing contract changes, I see us having regained the mid 20's. But to say this all comes down to CR3 is an understatement. I called 9p as being the ceiling until we get CR3 flow test results, because I never thought we'd get such great log results. And even with them, the mgt (f@ck up) discount has taken us back down to 9p. Resistance is now support (and will hopefully hold as I don't want to be wrong on this one). Reckon we'll see some steady, modest buying back to the 10-11p in a couple of weeks. In summary, it's a 50% immediate win, with up to 150% in 12 months given another 2 average to great Central wells. And the downside is you wait a year to get back to the same 9-10p level with overall production remaining steady from the modest Casc 3-5 and Compressor gains. Decent odds over 12 months. Until then we need to hold 9p. And if we get tails, I'd hope Calamity Baay gets his marching orders. The f @cking clown who has us at 9p. AIMHO",

I bought in on TRIN, which subsequently fell over because the deal wasn't locked down, and we ended up footing the bill for them pulling out. Classic Baay not looking at any fine print, the f @cking pr@t. Then I doubled down on our 'transformation asset' that Conjob Baay said would be funded through cash flow. He then pulled a last-minute raise with a bucket shop months later, which subsequently (infamously) fell over. He then said 'nothing to worry about, all paperwork, and legally locked down', without telling the market the raise funds, and another $9m were attached to the loan terms. Then we find out it's not legally locked down, and our friendly bank won't change the terms as he led the market to believe could be done. It seems the only ones who look at contracts are the bank, and not Calamity Baay. Then we have a debenture. And then a raise at 11p. And in between they f@ck Casc 4 twice. And drill close to a duster at Casc 5. All taking a year to achieve. Hopefully you can see the stories told by Baay have completely hoodwinked people, especially those averaging down in the 30's and 20's. The major damage was the failed raise and his misleading and withholding critical information from the market on the loan terms. Everything else from there was another nail in the coffin, but the 11p drop was all his doing. The man should have his nose removed.",

The few that have engaged in this behavior have been warned multiple times before getting banned.  Paul hasn't used me to spread any narrative, and I have reported on what I saw and heard in Trinidad where the main purpose of traveling down there was to see the CB plant.  JBL has both before and after continued a question and answer dialog with Paul which is quite informative about what is going on and gives participants and non participants much more info than had this dialogue not existed.  So no one needs to \"toe the line\", but you are expected to not spam with repetitive rants, present your points with something to back it up, and not attack people on a personal level.  It's pretty simple really, and much less restricted than many other forums that exist.  Would also like to point out as the \"owner\", I don't make any money from it, never have, and never will.  Going to Trinidad actually cost me money and time, and nothing I reported back on was influenced by the trip.",

I didn't post that often anyway due to the confirmation bias so what \"harm\" was I doing? I've list count of the private messages I've had saying Discord was better for my presence than not.

CR3 is already partially de-risked, so it's now about online execution, which thankfully Calamity Baay has nothing to do with.

          "content": "Johno, so you're saying that someone on Discord has just made something up about another Central well being drilled, which will push back CR3 hook-up...? So much for the Discord fanboy club dealing only with 'facts'. Also, do you not see how unbelievably unprofessional it is for Calamity Baay to be saying February to you, and yet putting in a RNS Q1. Either it will be in February, and he should relay this to the market, or it stays as Q1. And let's not get into any argument about it being one and the same, because it's not. There's potentially up to, and over, 1 month time-frame difference. It's utterly ridiculous that he's giving different messaging to a PI versus the market. As for all the questions put to Baay, perhaps the only thing you should be telling him is to provide the market with an update on the litany of things that are important to investors. Being more specific on CR3 hook-up for starters. Casc 3, 4 & 5 that he wants us to conveniently forget. A compressor timings update with incremental production guidance. And what the plan is next when it comes to drilling Central and/or other areas post CR3 drill results. It's absolutely ludicrous that this information trickles out of a PI group (with added spin), and not the company itself, through official channels or at the very least interviews. Whoever is responsible for the rumour regarding CR3 hook-up being delayed should share his/her source, and if it's not Baay, should shut the f@ck up. And if it is Baay, then he should be taken to task for saying such thing to a PI and not the market. And if true, to be drilling another Central well without knowing CR3 flow-rates is irresponsible to say the least. They were drilling the 'sweet spot' at Casc, the field they know so well, and got f'all oil rather than gas. If they drilled one well, hooked up and flow tested, they could have saved a chunk of money on the other. This is basic mgt for a geology they clearly still do not know. And how the hell does it take up to, and maybe over, 8-weeks to hook-up a well on-shore anyway? Why haven't they prepared everything required to cut this time-frame? Canada and the US take half the time. Pretty much sums up our 'management' team.",

'pb follow-up update (key facts)' john27, i would have thought you and others would be aware of the danger in relaying anything that pb says, followed by the word 'facts'. - casc 5 is on steady production, so why no update? it's not like this well, and casc 4 haven't cost shareholders an immense amount of time and money. and before anyone says, 'we don't report on single wells', that's not correct. he reports on good wells and will no doubt do so if cr3 is a success. another one of baay's 'don't look here, look over here' responses. - why has casc 3 not moved forward in any meaningful way? how long does it take to fix a pump? seriously, wtf have they been doing with casc 3, other than f @cking a raise, slithering around to find emergency funding, and f @cking casc 4 (twice) and casc 5? they did get cr3 right, so far, slow clap for calamity baay. - and there we have it on casc 4 = kicked into the long grass. it's great that central looks like it could save the company whose sp calamity baay has single-handedly destroyed, but there's absolutely nothing to get excited about on anything they have completed to date. casc 3 and 4 have gone nowhere, which is an extraordinary amount of time and money on two wells to still have nothing of benefit to shareholders. and he appears that he wants to hide casc 5, at least until he has some good news (hopefully) on central. pretty much sums up conjob baay's way of working. i honestly do not understand how people can get remunerated at $800k for delivering f@ck all, except for destroying shareholder wealth. god help us if central is poor. but not to worry, conjob baay will find a way to keep folks distracted 'don't look there (garble, excuse, b@ll****), look at the pricing contract changes in another year'. let's hope we have some good central news in a month with net production of +10mmcf.",

Reassessment of Development Plans and Reserves\u2028If CR-3 is not commercially productive, Touchstone would likely need to re-evaluate its Central Block development plans. A dry or underperforming CR-3 would weaken the case for additional Herrera development wells that the company has been targeting on the block. 2. Negative Pressure on Cash Flow and Capital Allocation\u2028Touchstone relies heavily on successful drilling outcomes to drive future production and funds flow. An unsuccessful CR-3 outcome would reduce near-term production growth and could mean lower cash flow than expected, making it harder to fund operations without additional capital raises or debt. The company is already exposed to drilling and operational risks that could materially affect results if targets aren\u2019t met. 3. Potential Need for Additional Fundraising\u2028Touchstone has financed past drilling and development through equity issuances and debt. If CR-3 fails, the company may need additional funding to continue exploration or development, potentially diluting shareholders. Its financial metrics, including debt and working capital, are sensitive to drilling success and commodity cash flow. \ud83d\udd39 Strategic and Market Consequences 4. Share Price Pressure and Investor Sentiment\u2028Exploration companies like Touchstone trade significantly on drilling success and forward projections. A failed well could lead to share price weakness, as investors would reassess future growth prospects and risk. Although not a guarantee, such outcomes historically weigh on small-cap E&P stocks when exploration disappoints. 5. Higher Perceived Risk on Future Drilling\u2028Unsuccessful results could increase perceived technical and geological risk among investors and partners. That might lead to higher capital costs or more cautious future planning, particularly for exploration and appraisal wells. \ud83d\udd39 Licensing and Operational Risk 6. Continued Exposure to Drilling/Exploration Risks\u2028Even with setbacks, Touchstone would still be obligated to fulfill licence and work commitments tied to its Trinidad and Tobago acreage. Poor results could force the company to either drill other prospects to retain rights or negotiate with partners/government, which could be costly or dilutive. \ud83d\udd39 Possible Upsides Despite Failure 7. Data Value and Technical Insights\u2028Sometimes an \u201cunsuccessful\u201d well still delivers useful geological and seismic data that refines future drilling plans. If CR-3 still provides insights into the subsurface \u2014 even if not commercially productive \u2014 it might benefit other prospects on the Central block or neighbouring acreage.\u201d",

          "content": "What if CR-3 actually works\u2026 and works properly? Not a marginal tick-box success, not \u201ccommercial but underwhelming\u201d, but a well that does exactly what it was drilled to do \u2013 confirms reservoir quality, flows at stable, economic rates, and most importantly demonstrates repeatability across Carapal Ridge. At that point, CR-3 stops being \u201ca well\u201d and becomes proof of concept. And proof of concept is where narratives die. Because once you have one well that performs, the conversation changes overnight. It\u2019s no longer \u201cif this works\u201d but \u201cgiven this works, how big is the inventory?\u201d Carapal Ridge stops being a hopeful exploration idea and starts being treated as a de-risked development fairway. Follow-on locations aren\u2019t speculative any more \u2013 they\u2019re queued. Then the market does the thing it always does, slowly at first and then all at once. People remember that Trinidad actually needs gas. That pricing is local, infrastructure already exists, and monetisation doesn\u2019t rely on heroic assumptions or global LNG fairy tales. Suddenly Touchstone Exploration Inc. isn\u2019t framed as a small AIM-listed E&P with execution risk, but as an onshore gas supplier with visibility, relevance, and optionality. This is where the bear case quietly collapses. Not with a bang, but with a shrug. There\u2019s nothing left to attack except tone. No more moving goalposts, no more \u201cyes but what if\u2026\u201d posts. Just silence, followed by revisionism. And then comes the really entertaining bit \u2013 the sentiment flip. The same people who demanded ever darker hypotheticals start saying things like \u201cwell obviously this was always the base case\u201d or \u201cthe market hasn\u2019t priced this yet\u201d. Broker language softens. NAVs creep up. Targets are labelled \u201cconservative\u201d while still implying multiples of the old price. The chart starts moving without news, because the argument has already been settled. Now imagine, just for a moment, that the forum didn\u2019t have a handful of posters trying absolutely anything to inject doubt at every stage. No constant background noise, no forced negativity, no deliberate mis-framing. Confidence compounds instead of being drained. Holders stop second-guessing. Liquidity improves. Volatility drops. Ironically, perceived risk falls \u2013 and with it the discount rate the market applies. At that point you don\u2019t get hype \u2013 you get acceptance. CR-3 becomes \u201cthe turning point well\u201d. Carapal Ridge becomes \u201cthe core asset\u201d. People stop talking about trading the stock and start talking about owning it. The downside case doesn\u2019t get debated any more \u2013 it gets archived. Which is the part that seems to upset some posters the most. Because bears only win if something fails. Bulls only need it to work once \u2013 and work properly.",

Yes, folk look at AIM and, particularly if they fall into a nest of rampers on e.g. Discord, convince themselves that AIM is high risk high reward.  The statistics are clear though: AIM is high risk low reward.  There are exceptions now and again where a high reward materialises that nimble traders can bank, but TXP clearly had its moment in the sun years ago and the last few years have been a slow reveal of poor management and poor assets. Look at the ongoing bull market in precious metals.  Look at how mainstream gold and silver plays have performed - it turns out elephants can jump!  Then compare the performance of AIM gold and plays - a few bright spots but much poorer performance on average.  Tells you all you need to know about AIM.",

And \"What are the rough valuation ranges in these scenarios?\"). I also asked GPT to give a prognosis wrt. 2025 and a 2026 guidance, based on RNS's and ERs from 2024 and 2025. I think the answers were interesting. But you can do your own research. And 2026 will rely on CR3 and (according to GPT) >7.000 BOEs per day in total (and we're not getting anywhere with that; that's the minimum grinding level). Not going to paste 20 pages of Q&As here and all the , but the final estimate (based on three scenarios). If you weight the valuation ranges we discussed earlier by these probabilities: Low case (\u00a320\u201340m) \u00d7 20% Medium case (\u00a380\u2013150m) \u00d7 50% High case (\u00a3200\u2013350m+) \u00d7 30% You end up with an expected outcome skewed heavily toward the medium\u2013high range, despite the low case existing. That\u2019s why CR-3 is: Not risk-free But asymmetrically attractive if execution is merely \u201cgood\u201d VAT (Next bit is for Dunder: I thought GPT might not have taken VAT into account. So I asked - just to see the detail of what it learned from browsing ERs. I think it goes deeper than most investors do) \"So in your 2026 forecast, do you consider VAT issues solved?\" Good questions \u2014 they go to the core realism of the 2026 forecast. 1\ufe0f\u20e3 In the 2026 forecast, am I assuming VAT issues are \u201csolved\u201d? Short answer: \ud83d\udc49 Partially solved, but not fully cleared. What I am assuming in the 2026 base case: VAT stops being a worsening problem Some cash inflow occurs VAT no longer dominates liquidity stress Specifically, the 2026 base case assumes: Partial VAT recovery (cash + bond monetisation) VAT receivable shrinks, but does not go to zero Management can plan without VAT uncertainty driving every decision What I am not assuming \u274c I am not assuming: Full VAT repayment in one lump sum Immediate conversion of all VAT bonds into cash That VAT becomes irrelevant to the balance sheet Numerically (roughly) In the 2026 model, VAT implicitly contributes something like: $4\u20136m of liquidity improvement via bond redemption / monetisation plus some cash settlement That is helpful, but: It does not rescue the company on its own The model still requires operating cash flow to do the heavy lifting If VAT is not resolved by 2026 If VAT receipts slip further: Net debt stays $5\u201310m higher Leverage remains elevated So VAT resolution is a supporting pillar, not the foundation.",

I guess they had 999.999 better targets, considering VAT and tax. ROI is just better elsewhere. Just like you, they're not constrained to operating in T&T.  Not to mention that their generel cost base and \"employee benefits\" is likely many times bigger than the T&T basis, leading to higher costs at CB than most other companies would accept. With a heli-pad and regional managers doing jet-set leadership, carried over on local, small assets. This is peanuts for them. They're taking down trees, not looking for peanuts. Certainly not peanuts for TXP though. If you want to see a company that did exactly what TXP might do, take a look at #VLE / Valeura. Amazing how much value you can create with extending lifetime and paying a low price for an asset bco. liabilities. Reserve growth and commercial targets... VLE is up 1000% or something over the last couple of years. It's still cheap btw.",

          "content": "Sturm, your argument about all the costs for Shell doesn't make sense if drilling another couple of wells, for relatively nothing to them, is going to double or triple production. You cannot have it both ways in explaining why they haven't drilled further wells. Ross, I agree the assets are far more complicated. But they have drilled a couple of very good wells in Casc. The issue is that every well is like a coin toss, because contrary to what Lyin Paul says, they don't have a good grip on anything, be it development and execution, or the geology. Some posters were questioning what happens if Casc 4 and 5 are poor only to be shouted down by the Discord experts who pointed to how much 'we know the Casc geology', these were 'safe play' wells, and 'I spoke with Paul' etc. At least now they are a little more restrained in how they respond to people saying Central is not a given until we've seen actual results. We have to hope this time the coin toss is favourable, and that Shell has missed an opportunity over all those years. But to date I haven't heard a single decent reason as to why Shell would have sunk all the capex, and have massive opex relative to sales, when all they have to do is drill a few more $5m wells into a producing field. The logs look good (but so did Casc 4 & 5), and so now we have to wait and hope, as usual with anything these clowns decide to do. Even the compressor has f@ck up written all over it. Something will be missing. Something will go wrong with the installation. The production gains end up being f@ck all. And it all won't be their fault. What exactly is happening with Casc 3 -5 doing right now? No official comms from Calamity Baay who is hiding them away, praying that Central will give him a shiny object to distract the Discord fanboys so they forget about these monumental screw-ups. We'll get these results only when Lyin Paul has something to distract people from what they have done with Casc - 'don't look over there, look over here'. I hesitate to say the bottom is in at 9p and any buyers are now going to have to pay +9.5p over the coming month.",

Incredibly disappointing, but producing at a very modest rate. The incremental production they squeeze out of Casc 3-5, and the compressor unit, and we'll effectively pay for Calamity Baay's remuneration and all the other freeloaders, plus service our debt obligations. All non-essential Capex will be stripped, and they will hold on for a year until the pricing contracts change to drill another well or two. The pricing change should get us back to 9-10p in 12 months. If our coin comes up heads, then I do see an immediate re-rate to 14-16p range. They will have enough cash to pay freeloader salaries, debt obligations, and I imagine to drill another 2 Central wells this year. If those wells are also moderately to quite successful, then you suddenly have a profitable, self-sustaining company that can afford to drill all-year round with the odd f@ck up. In 12 months with the pricing contract changes, I see us having regained the mid 20's. But to say this all comes down to CR3 is an understatement. I called 9p as being the ceiling until we get CR3 flow test results, because I never thought we'd get such great log results. And even with them, the mgt (f@ck up) discount has taken us back down to 9p. Resistance is now support (and will hopefully hold as I don't want to be wrong on this one). Reckon we'll see some steady, modest buying back to the 10-11p in a couple of weeks. In summary, it's a 50% immediate win, with up to 150% in 12 months given another 2 average to great Central wells. And the downside is you wait a year to get back to the same 9-10p level with overall production remaining steady from the modest Casc 3-5 and Compressor gains. Decent odds over 12 months. Until then we need to hold 9p. And if we get tails, I'd hope Calamity Baay gets his marching orders. The f @cking clown who has us at 9p. AIMHO",

I bought in on TRIN, which subsequently fell over because the deal wasn't locked down, and we ended up footing the bill for them pulling out. Classic Baay not looking at any fine print, the f @cking pr@t. Then I doubled down on our 'transformation asset' that Conjob Baay said would be funded through cash flow. He then pulled a last-minute raise with a bucket shop months later, which subsequently (infamously) fell over. He then said 'nothing to worry about, all paperwork, and legally locked down', without telling the market the raise funds, and another $9m were attached to the loan terms. Then we find out it's not legally locked down, and our friendly bank won't change the terms as he led the market to believe could be done. It seems the only ones who look at contracts are the bank, and not Calamity Baay. Then we have a debenture. And then a raise at 11p. And in between they f@ck Casc 4 twice. And drill close to a duster at Casc 5. All taking a year to achieve. Hopefully you can see the stories told by Baay have completely hoodwinked people, especially those averaging down in the 30's and 20's. The major damage was the failed raise and his misleading and withholding critical information from the market on the loan terms. Everything else from there was another nail in the coffin, but the 11p drop was all his doing. The man should have his nose removed.",

With a big horizontal well it's certainly a turning point, if it's commercial. I guess that just means the re-rate will be more aggressive.

'pb follow-up update (key facts)' john27, i would have thought you and others would be aware of the danger in relaying anything that pb says, followed by the word 'facts'. - casc 5 is on steady production, so why no update? it's not like this well, and casc 4 haven't cost shareholders an immense amount of time and money. and before anyone says, 'we don't report on single wells', that's not correct. he reports on good wells and will no doubt do so if cr3 is a success. another one of baay's 'don't look here, look over here' responses. - why has casc 3 not moved forward in any meaningful way? how long does it take to fix a pump? seriously, wtf have they been doing with casc 3, other than f @cking a raise, slithering around to find emergency funding, and f @cking casc 4 (twice) and casc 5? they did get cr3 right, so far, slow clap for calamity baay. - and there we have it on casc 4 = kicked into the long grass. it's great that central looks like it could save the company whose sp calamity baay has single-handedly destroyed, but there's absolutely nothing to get excited about on anything they have completed to date. casc 3 and 4 have gone nowhere, which is an extraordinary amount of time and money on two wells to still have nothing of benefit to shareholders. and he appears that he wants to hide casc 5, at least until he has some good news (hopefully) on central. pretty much sums up conjob baay's way of working. i honestly do not understand how people can get remunerated at $800k for delivering f@ck all, except for destroying shareholder wealth. god help us if central is poor. but not to worry, conjob baay will find a way to keep folks distracted 'don't look there (garble, excuse, b@ll****), look at the pricing contract changes in another year'. let's hope we have some good central news in a month with net production of +10mmcf.",

Well done anyone who sold out at breakeven or profit.I don\u2019t think 9p is a floor as fliirs don\u2019t exist. And to rely on Central is to rely on Ortoire or Cadcadura again!",

Reassessment of Development Plans and Reserves\u2028If CR-3 is not commercially productive, Touchstone would likely need to re-evaluate its Central Block development plans. A dry or underperforming CR-3 would weaken the case for additional Herrera development wells that the company has been targeting on the block. 2. Negative Pressure on Cash Flow and Capital Allocation\u2028Touchstone relies heavily on successful drilling outcomes to drive future production and funds flow. An unsuccessful CR-3 outcome would reduce near-term production growth and could mean lower cash flow than expected, making it harder to fund operations without additional capital raises or debt. The company is already exposed to drilling and operational risks that could materially affect results if targets aren\u2019t met. 3. Potential Need for Additional Fundraising\u2028Touchstone has financed past drilling and development through equity issuances and debt. If CR-3 fails, the company may need additional funding to continue exploration or development, potentially diluting shareholders. Its financial metrics, including debt and working capital, are sensitive to drilling success and commodity cash flow. \ud83d\udd39 Strategic and Market Consequences 4. Share Price Pressure and Investor Sentiment\u2028Exploration companies like Touchstone trade significantly on drilling success and forward projections. A failed well could lead to share price weakness, as investors would reassess future growth prospects and risk. Although not a guarantee, such outcomes historically weigh on small-cap E&P stocks when exploration disappoints. 5. Higher Perceived Risk on Future Drilling\u2028Unsuccessful results could increase perceived technical and geological risk among investors and partners. That might lead to higher capital costs or more cautious future planning, particularly for exploration and appraisal wells. \ud83d\udd39 Licensing and Operational Risk 6. Continued Exposure to Drilling/Exploration Risks\u2028Even with setbacks, Touchstone would still be obligated to fulfill licence and work commitments tied to its Trinidad and Tobago acreage. Poor results could force the company to either drill other prospects to retain rights or negotiate with partners/government, which could be costly or dilutive. \ud83d\udd39 Possible Upsides Despite Failure 7. Data Value and Technical Insights\u2028Sometimes an \u201cunsuccessful\u201d well still delivers useful geological and seismic data that refines future drilling plans. If CR-3 still provides insights into the subsurface \u2014 even if not commercially productive \u2014 it might benefit other prospects on the Central block or neighbouring acreage.\u201d",

          "content": "What if CR-3 actually works\u2026 and works properly? Not a marginal tick-box success, not \u201ccommercial but underwhelming\u201d, but a well that does exactly what it was drilled to do \u2013 confirms reservoir quality, flows at stable, economic rates, and most importantly demonstrates repeatability across Carapal Ridge. At that point, CR-3 stops being \u201ca well\u201d and becomes proof of concept. And proof of concept is where narratives die. Because once you have one well that performs, the conversation changes overnight. It\u2019s no longer \u201cif this works\u201d but \u201cgiven this works, how big is the inventory?\u201d Carapal Ridge stops being a hopeful exploration idea and starts being treated as a de-risked development fairway. Follow-on locations aren\u2019t speculative any more \u2013 they\u2019re queued. Then the market does the thing it always does, slowly at first and then all at once. People remember that Trinidad actually needs gas. That pricing is local, infrastructure already exists, and monetisation doesn\u2019t rely on heroic assumptions or global LNG fairy tales. Suddenly Touchstone Exploration Inc. isn\u2019t framed as a small AIM-listed E&P with execution risk, but as an onshore gas supplier with visibility, relevance, and optionality. This is where the bear case quietly collapses. Not with a bang, but with a shrug. There\u2019s nothing left to attack except tone. No more moving goalposts, no more \u201cyes but what if\u2026\u201d posts. Just silence, followed by revisionism. And then comes the really entertaining bit \u2013 the sentiment flip. The same people who demanded ever darker hypotheticals start saying things like \u201cwell obviously this was always the base case\u201d or \u201cthe market hasn\u2019t priced this yet\u201d. Broker language softens. NAVs creep up. Targets are labelled \u201cconservative\u201d while still implying multiples of the old price. The chart starts moving without news, because the argument has already been settled. Now imagine, just for a moment, that the forum didn\u2019t have a handful of posters trying absolutely anything to inject doubt at every stage. No constant background noise, no forced negativity, no deliberate mis-framing. Confidence compounds instead of being drained. Holders stop second-guessing. Liquidity improves. Volatility drops. Ironically, perceived risk falls \u2013 and with it the discount rate the market applies. At that point you don\u2019t get hype \u2013 you get acceptance. CR-3 becomes \u201cthe turning point well\u201d. Carapal Ridge becomes \u201cthe core asset\u201d. People stop talking about trading the stock and start talking about owning it. The downside case doesn\u2019t get debated any more \u2013 it gets archived. Which is the part that seems to upset some posters the most. Because bears only win if something fails. Bulls only need it to work once \u2013 and work properly.",

This approach plus some of the ridiculous nmahoukd have been delayed (again imho) exploration and other quite frankly moronic decisions later, has led to \"overpaying\" for what has always been an obvious Central transaction, even about half the happy clapping club saw this and have been stating that for literally years now!

Yes, folk look at AIM and, particularly if they fall into a nest of rampers on e.g. Discord, convince themselves that AIM is high risk high reward.  The statistics are clear though: AIM is high risk low reward.  There are exceptions now and again where a high reward materialises that nimble traders can bank, but TXP clearly had its moment in the sun years ago and the last few years have been a slow reveal of poor management and poor assets. Look at the ongoing bull market in precious metals.  Look at how mainstream gold and silver plays have performed - it turns out elephants can jump!  Then compare the performance of AIM gold and plays - a few bright spots but much poorer performance on average.  Tells you all you need to know about AIM.",

And \"What are the rough valuation ranges in these scenarios?\"). I also asked GPT to give a prognosis wrt. 2025 and a 2026 guidance, based on RNS's and ERs from 2024 and 2025. I think the answers were interesting. But you can do your own research. And 2026 will rely on CR3 and (according to GPT) >7.000 BOEs per day in total (and we're not getting anywhere with that; that's the minimum grinding level). Not going to paste 20 pages of Q&As here and all the , but the final estimate (based on three scenarios). If you weight the valuation ranges we discussed earlier by these probabilities: Low case (\u00a320\u201340m) \u00d7 20% Medium case (\u00a380\u2013150m) \u00d7 50% High case (\u00a3200\u2013350m+) \u00d7 30% You end up with an expected outcome skewed heavily toward the medium\u2013high range, despite the low case existing. That\u2019s why CR-3 is: Not risk-free But asymmetrically attractive if execution is merely \u201cgood\u201d VAT (Next bit is for Dunder: I thought GPT might not have taken VAT into account. So I asked - just to see the detail of what it learned from browsing ERs. I think it goes deeper than most investors do) \"So in your 2026 forecast, do you consider VAT issues solved?\" Good questions \u2014 they go to the core realism of the 2026 forecast. 1\ufe0f\u20e3 In the 2026 forecast, am I assuming VAT issues are \u201csolved\u201d? Short answer: \ud83d\udc49 Partially solved, but not fully cleared. What I am assuming in the 2026 base case: VAT stops being a worsening problem Some cash inflow occurs VAT no longer dominates liquidity stress Specifically, the 2026 base case assumes: Partial VAT recovery (cash + bond monetisation) VAT receivable shrinks, but does not go to zero Management can plan without VAT uncertainty driving every decision What I am not assuming \u274c I am not assuming: Full VAT repayment in one lump sum Immediate conversion of all VAT bonds into cash That VAT becomes irrelevant to the balance sheet Numerically (roughly) In the 2026 model, VAT implicitly contributes something like: $4\u20136m of liquidity improvement via bond redemption / monetisation plus some cash settlement That is helpful, but: It does not rescue the company on its own The model still requires operating cash flow to do the heavy lifting If VAT is not resolved by 2026 If VAT receipts slip further: Net debt stays $5\u201310m higher Leverage remains elevated So VAT resolution is a supporting pillar, not the foundation.",

As we are now at 10.25p that looks like \"up\" to me and there is much more to come.  I get it that you are unhappy, how could I not when your repeated posts make that clear. The time has come when you should just chill and watch the share price go up - It is the only way!",

It is more than possible that this little sp recovery is down to the leak of such information, which suggests that CR-3 is looking good.  However, how many times over the past 2-3 years have we been in this situation, only to be told that wells have not either not met expectations or encountered problems or some other issue? That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed on this because, as I commented previously, success with CR-3 could see the sp tick up to ca 15p (which would reflect a 50% increase) but more bad news will crater the sp, possibly to below 5p.",

It was TRIN mgt for the failed acquisition, and yet we have no legal recourse. If Schlumberger are 'taking full responsibility', then what compensation have we received, or is it just a verbal thing said to ConJob Baay.

Central volumes contributed approximately 2,217 boe/d during the third quarter. \u00b7      Petroleum and Natural Gas Sales: Totaled $12.70 million, a 4 percent decrease from $13.25 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter. -     Crude oil sales: $5.84 million from average production of 1,051 bbls/d at an average realized price of $60.30 per barrel. -     NGL sales: $1.34 million from average production volumes of 436 bbls/d at an average realized price of $33.41 per barrel. -     Natural gas sales: $5.52 million from average production of 21.9 MMcf/d (3,654 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.74 per Mcf. \u00b7      Operating Netback: Generated $5.86 million in operating netback, a 21 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas operating expenses. \u00b7      Funds Flow from Operations: Declined to $0.74 million from $3.02 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks, higher cash finance expenses, and increased current income taxes, partially offset by lower transaction costs. \u00b7      Net Loss: Recorded a net loss of $2.06 million ($0.01 per share) compared to net earnings of $1.85 million ($0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations, $1.50 million in additional depletion and depreciation expense, and the absence of a $0.78 million gain on asset disposition recognized in the prior year.\u201d Good luck with that $77.5M of debt!",

So the new Government is recognising that and helped us with approvals, like certificates for environmental compliance,\u201d Baay said. \u201cWe drilled the first well. We want to drill a second well, really quickly. That process, you know, used to be a nine-month process, and it\u2019s been shrunk down. Now it looks like it\u2019s going to be literally a couple of weeks, maybe a month.\u201d Baay added that the company could see some returns from that activity by the end of February. \u201cWe drilled the first well in December at the central block, and that\u2019s going to come on at the end of February. So you know that\u2019s like, we\u2019re not talking quarters here. We\u2019re talking months and weeks from when we can drill a well to when we get it on production,\u201d he said. Baay said, \u201cThose are the kind of reaction times that I think the new Government is recognising and putting in place the necessary things that we see. So from our point of view, that saves us money and saves us time. From the Government\u2019s point of view, that gets molecules on quicker for all of those suppliers that need them.\u201d The full article is available at https://guardian.co.tt/business/energy-sector-optimistic-about-2026-6.2.2501152.bff3b02b0a",

At worst, they will have the pricing contract changes to save their skin. They just won't be able to drill any new wells until it happens, even with an extra 1mmcf from the compressor, assuming they don't f@ck that up as well. Success with CR3 (above 5mmcf Net), and I imagine this will add 30-50%, depending on whether they get 5mmcf or 10mmcf Net production. As far as gambling goes, it's actually a decent punt. You get your money back in 1 year if CR3 comes up tails. Or you more than double your money in 1 year if it comes up heads. Just a shame that our charlatan CEO f@cked everything at a corporate level and his fanboys refuse to hold the useless, lying pr@t to account.",

Could be a great recovery for TXP holders IMO Only because we\u2019re above the 50dma all eyes will start to look for confirmation of a breakout which IMO will happen in Feb (I\u2019m positioning now, for maximum gains)   These are the levels AI has come up with \u2026 Based on technical data from January 2026, a \"Golden Cross\" for Touchstone Exploration (TXP) occurs when its 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above its 200-day moving average. As of late January 2026, the stock has recently shown short-term strength, crossing above its 50-day MA, but still requires significant upside to trigger a golden cross with the long-term 200-day MA. Required Levels for a Golden Cross (Approximate, Jan 2026) 200-Day Moving Average (Long-Term): Approximately C$0.21 - C$0.23 (Toronto Stock Exchange) 50-Day Moving Average (Short-Term): Currently rising from around C$0.15 - C$0.16 To achieve the Golden Cross: The 50-day MA must rise above the 200-day MA. This requires the share price to maintain recent gains and trade sustainably above the C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 range to pull the 50-day average upward. Current Technical Context (As of Jan 21-24, 2026) Current Price: Trading around C$0.18 Situation: The stock crossed above its 50-day moving average (C$0.15), indicating short-term momentum, but remains significantly below the 200-day moving average (C$0.21). Conclusion: The 50-day MA is still below the 200-day MA, meaning a Golden Cross is not yet confirmed and requires further sustained upward movement. Key Price Levels to Watch Resistance: The 200-day MA at C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 is the primary hurdle for the golden cross. Volume: High trading volume during an upward move is required to confirm the bullish signal. Analyst Target: Analysts have indicated a median 12-month target of 35p (approx CAD) on the London Stock Exchange, which would comfortably trigger a golden cross if achieved.",

In the O&G industry, what happens during such periods is that those physically undertaking the  work/assessment become pregnant with inside knowledge and are aware that there are many outsiders willing to \"obtain\" such information for investment purposes, invariably for reward.  It is more than possible that this little sp recovery is down to the leak of such information, which suggests that CR-3 is looking good.  However, how many times over the past 2-3 years have we been in this situation, only to be told that wells have not either not met expectations or encountered problems or some other issue? That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed on this because, as I commented previously, success with CR-3 could see the sp tick up to ca 15p (which would reflect a 50% increase) but more bad news will crater the sp, possibly to below 5p.",

While domestic output remains below past highs, operators are moving ahead with developments that could stabilise supply and extend the life of key infrastructure. bpTT is set to bring its Cypre field online in 2024, with the Mento project expected to follow by 2026. Shell\u2019s Manatee field, a larger offshore development, is targeting first gas in 2027. These timelines reflect a longer build-out cycle, but the government has signalled progress in streamlining approvals to speed up execution. Touchstone Exploration is also expanding onshore activity, with current drilling focused on tying in to midstream infrastructure. With large undeveloped gas reserves just across the maritime border, including the Dragon and Manakin\u2013Cocuina fields, Venezuela offers a clear supply-side opportunity. These fields are close enough to be tied into Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s existing processing and LNG facilities with relatively limited new investment. Touchstone\u2019s leadership has also expressed interest in opportunities tied to Venezuela, noting the size of the reserves and the regional infrastructure advantages. While smaller players face higher entry barriers, alignment between state and corporate interests could open access over time. Touchstone Exploration Inc (LON:TXP) is a Canadian-based, international upstream oil and gas company currently active in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Primera Oil and Gas is the Trinidadian subsidiary of Touchstone.",

Operating cash vs free cash flow You\u2019re absolutely right that TXP has been FCF-negative during a heavy capex phase. That\u2019s not controversial, and it\u2019s been openly stated by management. But that\u2019s a capital allocation choice, not a sign the underlying business can\u2019t generate cash. TXP can cover debt service and opex from operations, and still be FCF-negative if it chooses to reinvest heavily. Those are not mutually exclusive. Debt service vs balance sheet optics. The point I made (and keep making) is narrower than the argument you\u2019re rebutting. I\u2019m not saying TXP is \u201cfinancially strong\u201d in a balance-sheet sense today. I am saying existing production covers debt servicing and running costs. That matters, because it means CR-3 is about upside and inflection, not insolvency. A poor CR-3 outcome does not automatically create a \u201czombie company\u201d That distinction gets lost when everything is framed as binary success/failure. The share price doesn\u2019t reflect \u201ccan the company pay its bills\u201d It reflects, dilution risk, execution fatigue, credibility scars from past guidance and capital intensity vs timing. All fair points but they\u2019re market psychology, not proof the operating base is broken. As for covenant waivers again, not unusual in a scale-up phase following a major acquisition. They\u2019re uncomfortable, but not the same as being unable to service debt. But we\u2019re not cash-dead, and CR-3 does not determine whether the lights stay on. CR-3 determines pricing uplift, speed of deleveraging and whether growth is self-funded or diluted. That\u2019s the distinction I was making and not claiming everything is rosy. Happy to debate numbers, but it helps if we\u2019re debating the same question.",

          "content": "no it's conjobbaay just talking **** again. i mean venezuela now, what a ****. john27, you of all people should be the last person talking about how we can cover this and that through cashflow. the number of times discord members have shouted down people with such numbers is quite ridiculous. and none of them have come remotely close to the appalling figures that have ended up being reported. if we were so financially sound, we wouldn't be sitting in single digits after drilling such a promising well. simple as that. as for the numbers you are quoting, there's a big difference between operating income and how much cash we're generating. here's your reality check: overview: based on the most recent rns filings (up to q3 2025, released in november 2025), touchstone exploration is currently in a \"heavy investment\" phase. while production is scaling up, free cash flow remains negative because capital expenditures (drilling and acquisitions) are currently outstripping the cash generated from operations. note on cash generation: the company uses \"funds flow from operations\" as its primary cash metric. free cash flow (fcf) here is estimated by subtracting capital expenditures from funds flow. as you can see, the fcf has been increasingly negative over the past 12 months as they ramp up drilling at cascadura. recent quarter analysis: q3 2025 the most recent quarter shows a company under temporary financial pressure but with growing asset scale: - net debt surge: debt climbed to $77.75 million, largely due to a $12.5 million convertible debenture and the earlier $30 million acquisition of the \"central block.\" - production: averaged 5,141 boe/d. while this is an increase over q2, the \"funds flow\" dropped to just $0.74m due to higher financing costs (interest on that new debt) and higher taxes. - the \"waiver\": crucially, touchstone had to obtain a financial covenant waiver from its lender for the end of 2025, suggesting they are operating very close to their debt limits. next 12 months: outlook for 2026 - the health of the company over the next 12 months depends entirely on converting recent drilling into consistent cash: - revenue growth: analysts project revenue growth of ~49% as new wells like cascadura-5 and carapal ridge-3 (results announced jan 2026) contribute to the full-year total. - cash inflection: the company expects to generate roughly $22 million in funds flow for the full year 2025/2026. if they keep capital spending around the $23m mark (as budgeted), they will be roughly cash-flow neutral or slightly negative until the next major production step-change. - debt reduction: management\u2019s goal is to bring net debt back down toward $30 million by the end of 2025/early 2026, though this relies on no further major acquisition spending. summary: touchstone is \"asset rich but cash tight.\" they have successfully grown production, but the cost of that growth has pushed debt to a peak. they need a smooth, high-volume product",

It was TRIN mgt for the failed acquisition, and yet we have no legal recourse. If Schlumberger are 'taking full responsibility', then what compensation have we received, or is it just a verbal thing said to ConJob Baay. The drilling mud from what I understand, was cutting corners on costs, alongside the re-entering a f@cked hole, which we know was the case. Senior mgt failures!

Central volumes contributed approximately 2,217 boe/d during the third quarter. \u00b7      Petroleum and Natural Gas Sales: Totaled $12.70 million, a 4 percent decrease from $13.25 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter. -     Crude oil sales: $5.84 million from average production of 1,051 bbls/d at an average realized price of $60.30 per barrel. -     NGL sales: $1.34 million from average production volumes of 436 bbls/d at an average realized price of $33.41 per barrel. -     Natural gas sales: $5.52 million from average production of 21.9 MMcf/d (3,654 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.74 per Mcf. \u00b7      Operating Netback: Generated $5.86 million in operating netback, a 21 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas operating expenses. \u00b7      Funds Flow from Operations: Declined to $0.74 million from $3.02 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks, higher cash finance expenses, and increased current income taxes, partially offset by lower transaction costs. \u00b7      Net Loss: Recorded a net loss of $2.06 million ($0.01 per share) compared to net earnings of $1.85 million ($0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations, $1.50 million in additional depletion and depreciation expense, and the absence of a $0.78 million gain on asset disposition recognized in the prior year.\u201d Good luck with that $77.5M of debt!",

The very fact they wish to save investor's  ( which is such an embarrassing statement to come out with ) as that has never happened, purely because investor's have already made up their minds how they wish to play . You are not just negative all the time, you are also becoming extremely boring  which the 2 usually go hand in hand. Hundreds of posts and many hrs here yet you have zero intention on buying and you want people to believe what you say . That alone say just how boring you are to do that when there is always other investments you can work on or research to better understand a company.   Always best to avoid people like yourself as they just drag you down . Your history is truly shocking.",

It looks like a coin toss to me, so I just don\u2019t see the attraction.  It\u2019s speculation, not investment. I think this could be a good year for O&G but there are better propositions out there.",

But as we start to ramp up here with the new acquisition we\u2019ve done, and as we do more drilling, we use more local content\u2014which is also a tricky term in Trinidad, because local content can be \u2018local content\u2019 and \u2018local local content\u2019 right down to the neighbourhoods we operate in. As we move out of an area and into another, there is a perception that some of the jobs are lost, but generally, they get picked up wherever we\u2019re moving to.\u201d Baay said one of the major recent developments at the company has been the completed drilling of the Central Block, about which he said he was excited, despite the slow start; he predicted a busy 2026.",

So the new Government is recognising that and helped us with approvals, like certificates for environmental compliance,\u201d Baay said. \u201cWe drilled the first well. We want to drill a second well, really quickly. That process, you know, used to be a nine-month process, and it\u2019s been shrunk down. Now it looks like it\u2019s going to be literally a couple of weeks, maybe a month.\u201d Baay added that the company could see some returns from that activity by the end of February. \u201cWe drilled the first well in December at the central block, and that\u2019s going to come on at the end of February. So you know that\u2019s like, we\u2019re not talking quarters here. We\u2019re talking months and weeks from when we can drill a well to when we get it on production,\u201d he said. Baay said, \u201cThose are the kind of reaction times that I think the new Government is recognising and putting in place the necessary things that we see. So from our point of view, that saves us money and saves us time. From the Government\u2019s point of view, that gets molecules on quicker for all of those suppliers that need them.\u201d The full article is available at https://guardian.co.tt/business/energy-sector-optimistic-about-2026-6.2.2501152.bff3b02b0a",

At worst, they will have the pricing contract changes to save their skin. They just won't be able to drill any new wells until it happens, even with an extra 1mmcf from the compressor, assuming they don't f@ck that up as well. Success with CR3 (above 5mmcf Net), and I imagine this will add 30-50%, depending on whether they get 5mmcf or 10mmcf Net production. As far as gambling goes, it's actually a decent punt. You get your money back in 1 year if CR3 comes up tails. Or you more than double your money in 1 year if it comes up heads. Just a shame that our charlatan CEO f@cked everything at a corporate level and his fanboys refuse to hold the useless, lying pr@t to account.",

Could be a great recovery for TXP holders IMO Only because we\u2019re above the 50dma all eyes will start to look for confirmation of a breakout which IMO will happen in Feb (I\u2019m positioning now, for maximum gains)   These are the levels AI has come up with \u2026 Based on technical data from January 2026, a \"Golden Cross\" for Touchstone Exploration (TXP) occurs when its 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above its 200-day moving average. As of late January 2026, the stock has recently shown short-term strength, crossing above its 50-day MA, but still requires significant upside to trigger a golden cross with the long-term 200-day MA. Required Levels for a Golden Cross (Approximate, Jan 2026) 200-Day Moving Average (Long-Term): Approximately C$0.21 - C$0.23 (Toronto Stock Exchange) 50-Day Moving Average (Short-Term): Currently rising from around C$0.15 - C$0.16 To achieve the Golden Cross: The 50-day MA must rise above the 200-day MA. This requires the share price to maintain recent gains and trade sustainably above the C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 range to pull the 50-day average upward. Current Technical Context (As of Jan 21-24, 2026) Current Price: Trading around C$0.18 Situation: The stock crossed above its 50-day moving average (C$0.15), indicating short-term momentum, but remains significantly below the 200-day moving average (C$0.21). Conclusion: The 50-day MA is still below the 200-day MA, meaning a Golden Cross is not yet confirmed and requires further sustained upward movement. Key Price Levels to Watch Resistance: The 200-day MA at C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 is the primary hurdle for the golden cross. Volume: High trading volume during an upward move is required to confirm the bullish signal. Analyst Target: Analysts have indicated a median 12-month target of 35p (approx CAD) on the London Stock Exchange, which would comfortably trigger a golden cross if achieved.",

It is more than possible that this little sp recovery is down to the leak of such information, which suggests that CR-3 is looking good.  However, how many times over the past 2-3 years have we been in this situation, only to be told that wells have not either not met expectations or encountered problems or some other issue? That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed on this because, as I commented previously, success with CR-3 could see the sp tick up to ca 15p (which would reflect a 50% increase) but more bad news will crater the sp, possibly to below 5p.",

Everyone is, of course, entitled to their own view. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk of blurring genuine frustration with hindsight bias. CR-3 will ultimately be judged on data, not sentiment. Until then, everyone has to manage their own risk and exposure. Without criticism, I\u2019ve always taken note of your frustrations and have raised some directly with TXP.

It\u2019s not only Touchstone that\u2019s been exploring for and finding significant new resources, but the large independents have been buying up assets (Perenco has invested billions over the past couple of years) and the majors have been busy. Exxon returned last August, Shell and BP never left, and Chevron and Total are interested. There\u2019s even an increasing prospect that Trinidad\u2019s refinery will reopen later this year (see https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/After-Years-Offline-Trinidad-Looks-to-Indian-Oil-to-Restart-Refining.amp.html). Oil production is rising again and some major gas projects will soon come on line. Energy still makes up about half the economy and, although there are various ways to further improve the fiscal system, it\u2019s not a bad place to do business (Touchstone, like other producers, has no transportation costs and is paid monthly in US dollars). I\u2019m much more comfortable investing in Trinidad than, say, in a company producing oil in the jungles of Peru. The AIM has its flaws, but plenty of decent companies, including Touchstone, are listed on it. It\u2019s far from untouchable and Warren Buffett, through CalEnergy, had a partnership with Parkmead Group (an AIM company).",

Working from historical FCF allows you to draw a more reliable trajectory while also assessing what was delivered at each stage against what was then expected. When significant positive change is promised or even just a possibility, it is tempting to load up in anticipation.  More often than not though you are better on the sidelines - in the event of disappointment you are well out while if significant positive change is actually delivered you will understand its significance and be able to get in ahead of those who don\u2019t (likely buying the shares of the inevitable sellers into the news).",

If they have stopped then this might have been because the figures have for a while been showing an industry in decline, due in no small part to T&T\u2019s relatively unfriendly fiscal regime.

It takes into account how indebted a company is versus earnings. Agree that CR3 flow rates will be month end at best. I personally think it will be early March, and probably best to report on an extended production rate. That 700k buy overpaid, but good to see a counter to the big seller the past 1-2 weeks.

And, providing the compressor operates as expected, the added production from Casc 4, 5, CR3, even if poor, plus Compressor will keep the sp range bound in the single digits but climb back to this level by end of year as pricing changes approach. That's why I say it's a good 'bet' as there's far less to lose from this level versus say 12p when they f@cked Casc 4 (again) and Casc 5 ended up being nothing remotely like what they were forecasting. It wasn't even gas ffs. Great place for new entrants given what we know about Central already, and there have been no f@ck ups with the well or seemingly the hook up (so far). Highland, that comment isn't quite accurate. I think you mean to say he won't provide single well detail because it shows the extent of some of their development f@ck ups. But of course he will provide CR3 detail if it's successful. You need to always keep in mind that Baay is a conman, so is going to share the good news, and always try to bury any bad news. Currently there's no good news, but CR3 could change all of that.",

Cascadura, Central Block and legacy production are all real, producing and cash-positive, and together they cover debt service - albeit without much slack. That\u2019s exactly why management has prioritised stability over growth at this time. Central Block is already a meaningful cash contributor: while it represents roughly 40\u201345% of volumes, its lower operating costs mean it contributes a higher share of operating cash flow. With the main pipeline runs now complete and only final tie-ins and sign-off remaining, Central Block is well positioned to be the most efficient area for near-term growth. Some recent declines are operational rather than structural. The manufacturing fault on the Cascadura-3 pump is being rectified at no cost, workover options are being evaluated at Cascadura-4, and compression at Cascadura should stabilise deliverability rather than chase aggressive growth there. Central Block remains upside, not existential risk but CR-3 should tell us most of what we need to know for the rest of 2026. I\u2019d rather see TXP survive, de-lever and rebuild by growing Central Block sensibly than chase higher-risk growth elsewhere or be forced into a distressed outcome.",

Note that Central Block, which has the same formation as Cascudura, has a compressor.

The compressor will provide pressure stability that will both boost production and stability.

The issue has been system back-pressure and export constraints, not wells \u201crunning out of gas.\u201d TXP\u2019s setup is also fundamentally different: dedicated infrastructure, controlled inflows, and compression added proactively rather than as a last-ditch optimisation on a dying asset. The rationale for the new compressor comes directly from observed results at Central Block, where compression materially stabilised output across multiple producing wells. No one is suggesting compression reverses reservoir decline. The objective is to reduce back-pressure, improve drawdown, slow pressure-driven decline and stabilise the base",

However, at this moment in time, irrespective of the company's financial condition, a negative CR-3 will hurt the sp considerably, hence my \"coin toss\" title.",

While domestic output remains below past highs, operators are moving ahead with developments that could stabilise supply and extend the life of key infrastructure. bpTT is set to bring its Cypre field online in 2024, with the Mento project expected to follow by 2026. Shell\u2019s Manatee field, a larger offshore development, is targeting first gas in 2027. These timelines reflect a longer build-out cycle, but the government has signalled progress in streamlining approvals to speed up execution. Touchstone Exploration is also expanding onshore activity, with current drilling focused on tying in to midstream infrastructure. With large undeveloped gas reserves just across the maritime border, including the Dragon and Manakin\u2013Cocuina fields, Venezuela offers a clear supply-side opportunity. These fields are close enough to be tied into Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s existing processing and LNG facilities with relatively limited new investment. Touchstone\u2019s leadership has also expressed interest in opportunities tied to Venezuela, noting the size of the reserves and the regional infrastructure advantages. While smaller players face higher entry barriers, alignment between state and corporate interests could open access over time. Touchstone Exploration Inc (LON:TXP) is a Canadian-based, international upstream oil and gas company currently active in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Primera Oil and Gas is the Trinidadian subsidiary of Touchstone.",

Operating cash vs free cash flow You\u2019re absolutely right that TXP has been FCF-negative during a heavy capex phase. That\u2019s not controversial, and it\u2019s been openly stated by management. But that\u2019s a capital allocation choice, not a sign the underlying business can\u2019t generate cash. TXP can cover debt service and opex from operations, and still be FCF-negative if it chooses to reinvest heavily. Those are not mutually exclusive. Debt service vs balance sheet optics. The point I made (and keep making) is narrower than the argument you\u2019re rebutting. I\u2019m not saying TXP is \u201cfinancially strong\u201d in a balance-sheet sense today. I am saying existing production covers debt servicing and running costs. That matters, because it means CR-3 is about upside and inflection, not insolvency. A poor CR-3 outcome does not automatically create a \u201czombie company\u201d That distinction gets lost when everything is framed as binary success/failure. The share price doesn\u2019t reflect \u201ccan the company pay its bills\u201d It reflects, dilution risk, execution fatigue, credibility scars from past guidance and capital intensity vs timing. All fair points but they\u2019re market psychology, not proof the operating base is broken. As for covenant waivers again, not unusual in a scale-up phase following a major acquisition. They\u2019re uncomfortable, but not the same as being unable to service debt. But we\u2019re not cash-dead, and CR-3 does not determine whether the lights stay on. CR-3 determines pricing uplift, speed of deleveraging and whether growth is self-funded or diluted. That\u2019s the distinction I was making and not claiming everything is rosy. Happy to debate numbers, but it helps if we\u2019re debating the same question.",

It was TRIN mgt for the failed acquisition, and yet we have no legal recourse. If Schlumberger are 'taking full responsibility', then what compensation have we received, or is it just a verbal thing said to ConJob Baay. The drilling mud from what I understand, was cutting corners on costs, alongside the re-entering a f@cked hole, which we know was the case. Senior mgt failures!

Always DYOR and remember that BB rampers (even more so Telegram and Discord rampers) are bad for your wealth. No one should ever commit a significant amount of capital to shares like these. Even my beloved PTAL, as a single country play, is not for widows and orphans. Stock selection should really just be a question of choosing between Newmont and Barrick. Or you could have both. There you go - job done, PF secured - now you can go outside and play.\u201d As you can see I was quite positive on Newmont and Barrick from my own sector.  If folk had followed my suggestion and forgotten about AIM crap they would have more than doubled their money.",

Central volumes contributed approximately 2,217 boe/d during the third quarter. \u00b7      Petroleum and Natural Gas Sales: Totaled $12.70 million, a 4 percent decrease from $13.25 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter. -     Crude oil sales: $5.84 million from average production of 1,051 bbls/d at an average realized price of $60.30 per barrel. -     NGL sales: $1.34 million from average production volumes of 436 bbls/d at an average realized price of $33.41 per barrel. -     Natural gas sales: $5.52 million from average production of 21.9 MMcf/d (3,654 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.74 per Mcf. \u00b7      Operating Netback: Generated $5.86 million in operating netback, a 21 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas operating expenses. \u00b7      Funds Flow from Operations: Declined to $0.74 million from $3.02 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks, higher cash finance expenses, and increased current income taxes, partially offset by lower transaction costs. \u00b7      Net Loss: Recorded a net loss of $2.06 million ($0.01 per share) compared to net earnings of $1.85 million ($0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations, $1.50 million in additional depletion and depreciation expense, and the absence of a $0.78 million gain on asset disposition recognized in the prior year.\u201d Good luck with that $77.5M of debt!",

You are not just negative all the time, you are also becoming extremely boring  which the 2 usually go hand in hand. Hundreds of posts and many hrs here yet you have zero intention on buying and you want people to believe what you say . That alone say just how boring you are to do that when there is always other investments you can work on or research to better understand a company.

Good luck with that.  A marginally commercial CR-3 would still leave TXP a steep hill to climb. Only a very robust performance from CR-3 is going to re-establish a growth trajectory here.  I think you need to entirely tune out the fanboy narrative around CR-3 (remember how wrong they got Cas-5) and look again at the balance of risk and reward.  It looks like a coin toss to me, so I just don\u2019t see the attraction.  It\u2019s speculation, not investment.

So the new Government is recognising that and helped us with approvals, like certificates for environmental compliance,\u201d Baay said. \u201cWe drilled the first well. We want to drill a second well, really quickly. That process, you know, used to be a nine-month process, and it\u2019s been shrunk down. Now it looks like it\u2019s going to be literally a couple of weeks, maybe a month.\u201d Baay added that the company could see some returns from that activity by the end of February. \u201cWe drilled the first well in December at the central block, and that\u2019s going to come on at the end of February. So you know that\u2019s like, we\u2019re not talking quarters here. We\u2019re talking months and weeks from when we can drill a well to when we get it on production,\u201d he said. Baay said, \u201cThose are the kind of reaction times that I think the new Government is recognising and putting in place the necessary things that we see. So from our point of view, that saves us money and saves us time. From the Government\u2019s point of view, that gets molecules on quicker for all of those suppliers that need them.\u201d The full article is available at https://guardian.co.tt/business/energy-sector-optimistic-about-2026-6.2.2501152.bff3b02b0a",

At worst, they will have the pricing contract changes to save their skin. They just won't be able to drill any new wells until it happens, even with an extra 1mmcf from the compressor, assuming they don't f@ck that up as well. Success with CR3 (above 5mmcf Net), and I imagine this will add 30-50%, depending on whether they get 5mmcf or 10mmcf Net production. As far as gambling goes, it's actually a decent punt. You get your money back in 1 year if CR3 comes up tails. Or you more than double your money in 1 year if it comes up heads. Just a shame that our charlatan CEO f@cked everything at a corporate level and his fanboys refuse to hold the useless, lying pr@t to account.",

Could be a great recovery for TXP holders IMO Only because we\u2019re above the 50dma all eyes will start to look for confirmation of a breakout which IMO will happen in Feb (I\u2019m positioning now, for maximum gains)   These are the levels AI has come up with \u2026 Based on technical data from January 2026, a \"Golden Cross\" for Touchstone Exploration (TXP) occurs when its 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above its 200-day moving average. As of late January 2026, the stock has recently shown short-term strength, crossing above its 50-day MA, but still requires significant upside to trigger a golden cross with the long-term 200-day MA. Required Levels for a Golden Cross (Approximate, Jan 2026) 200-Day Moving Average (Long-Term): Approximately C$0.21 - C$0.23 (Toronto Stock Exchange) 50-Day Moving Average (Short-Term): Currently rising from around C$0.15 - C$0.16 To achieve the Golden Cross: The 50-day MA must rise above the 200-day MA. This requires the share price to maintain recent gains and trade sustainably above the C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 range to pull the 50-day average upward. Current Technical Context (As of Jan 21-24, 2026) Current Price: Trading around C$0.18 Situation: The stock crossed above its 50-day moving average (C$0.15), indicating short-term momentum, but remains significantly below the 200-day moving average (C$0.21). Conclusion: The 50-day MA is still below the 200-day MA, meaning a Golden Cross is not yet confirmed and requires further sustained upward movement. Key Price Levels to Watch Resistance: The 200-day MA at C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 is the primary hurdle for the golden cross. Volume: High trading volume during an upward move is required to confirm the bullish signal. Analyst Target: Analysts have indicated a median 12-month target of 35p (approx CAD) on the London Stock Exchange, which would comfortably trigger a golden cross if achieved.",

It is more than possible that this little sp recovery is down to the leak of such information, which suggests that CR-3 is looking good.  However, how many times over the past 2-3 years have we been in this situation, only to be told that wells have not either not met expectations or encountered problems or some other issue? That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed on this because, as I commented previously, success with CR-3 could see the sp tick up to ca 15p (which would reflect a 50% increase) but more bad news will crater the sp, possibly to below 5p.",

I\u2019m not dismissing risk; I\u2019m explicitly modelling it. If CR-3 fails, downside is limited to where we are now. If it lands even mid-case, the valuation moves materially. That asymmetry is the whole point. Calling that \u201cgoing to zero risk\u201d without showing a credible path to insolvency is assertion, not argument.

A failed well caps downside near today\u2019s valuation; a commercially successful well materially shifts cash flow, probabilities, and pricing assumptions \u2014 as we\u2019ve just shown numerically.

The market isn\u2019t declaring CR-3 worthless; it\u2019s withholding value until data arrives. That\u2019s uncertainty pricing, not proof the reward is inadequate. If CR-3 lands anywhere near the mid-case, the maths moves quickly. If it doesn\u2019t, value drops back to where it is now.

Expectations are being managed, but the prediction last year (see for example the August 2025 presentation) was it would produce 10 million per day and more recently Touchstone has indicated that if four wells are added to Central Block this year production from that block alone could more than double (with the increase attracting a much higher price than existing production). If that happens, and we'll have a better idea once we get the CR3 results, the disasters of 2025 will be well behind us. There's also plenty of gas still to extract from Cascudura, but it makes sense to leave it to 2027 when much higher prices will apply once the existing contract expires. A bonus this year will be if there's a deep oil farm out and some drilling. That's difficult to predict, but after years of decline there's increasing interest in Trinidad (evidenced amongst other things by Exxon's return last August) perhaps in part because of the deep oil discoveries in Guyana etc and the new government's red-tape cutting should help too. Add in the boost from the compressor in May/June and a VAT refund, and it may well be a very good year. Nothing's guaranteed though.",

That landscape was, after all, painted for them by Paul Baay.  The brushwork he used for the wall of cash looming on the horizon was just masterful. The last five years have seen Paul Baay presiding over significant operational and financial ineptitude and a pretty slippery communications strategy.  If you think otherwise you are either too close to PB or have just not been paying attention.  Or both.  G_G_G\u2019s ire towards PB is understandable, but he is still missing an important point.  The last five years have also seen it becoming increasingly clear that Ortoire is just not all that.  The money maker is looking more like a money pit (the compressor, for example, just sounds like damage limitation). A false \u201cpoor management/great assets\u201d narrative has definitely kept some folk hanging on in the hope that a change of management would make all the difference or that the assets would grow shareholder value despite the management.  The reality though is that TXP has seen a perfect storm of poor management and marginal assets. It\u2019s all really down to Central Block now.  If TXP cannot successfully reinvent itself around Central Block it is pretty much done and G_G_G is well out of it.",

I also genuinely feel for your losses as many here have suffered in different ways after misreading the landscape back in 2021. On the wider point, strong language aside, accusations of deliberate market-misleading are serious and, in the absence of specifics, inevitably contentious. Everyone is, of course, entitled to their own view. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk of blurring genuine frustration with hindsight bias. CR-3 will ultimately be judged on data, not sentiment. Until then, everyone has to manage their own risk and exposure. Without criticism, I\u2019ve always taken note of your frustrations and have raised some directly with TXP. Having spent a full day on site with Paul and the team, the only feedback I can offer is that the focus is firmly on Central Block and on stabilising current declines, something that should become clearer over the coming 2\u20133 weeks.",

I also genuinely feel for your losses as many here have suffered in different ways after misreading the landscape back in 2021. On the wider point, strong language aside, accusations of deliberate market-misleading are serious and, in the absence of specifics, inevitably contentious. Everyone is, of course, entitled to their own view. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk of blurring genuine frustration with hindsight bias. CR-3 will ultimately be judged on data, not sentiment. Until then, everyone has to manage their own risk and exposure. Without criticism, I\u2019ve always taken note of your frustrations and have raised some directly with TXP. Having spent a full day on site with Paul and the team, the only feedback I can offer is that the focus is firmly on Central Block and on stabilising current declines, something that should become clearer over the coming 2\u20133 weeks.",

It\u2019s not only Touchstone that\u2019s been exploring for and finding significant new resources, but the large independents have been buying up assets (Perenco has invested billions over the past couple of years) and the majors have been busy. Exxon returned last August, Shell and BP never left, and Chevron and Total are interested. There\u2019s even an increasing prospect that Trinidad\u2019s refinery will reopen later this year (see https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/After-Years-Offline-Trinidad-Looks-to-Indian-Oil-to-Restart-Refining.amp.html). Oil production is rising again and some major gas projects will soon come on line. Energy still makes up about half the economy and, although there are various ways to further improve the fiscal system, it\u2019s not a bad place to do business (Touchstone, like other producers, has no transportation costs and is paid monthly in US dollars). I\u2019m much more comfortable investing in Trinidad than, say, in a company producing oil in the jungles of Peru. The AIM has its flaws, but plenty of decent companies, including Touchstone, are listed on it. It\u2019s far from untouchable and Warren Buffett, through CalEnergy, had a partnership with Parkmead Group (an AIM company).",

When significant positive change is promised or even just a possibility, it is tempting to load up in anticipation.  More often than not though you are better on the sidelines - in the event of disappointment you are well out while if significant positive change is actually delivered you will understand its significance and be able to get in ahead of those who don\u2019t (likely buying the shares of the inevitable sellers into the news).",

It reall is a coin flip in that field though. Sturm, there's a reason why Buffet thinks pe ratios are a waste of time. It's about fcf and when looking at ratios use EV. It takes into account how indebted a company is versus earnings. Agree that CR3 flow rates will be month end at best. I personally think it will be early March, and probably best to report on an extended production rate. That 700k buy overpaid, but good to see a counter to the big seller the past 1-2 weeks.

And, providing the compressor operates as expected, the added production from Casc 4, 5, CR3, even if poor, plus Compressor will keep the sp range bound in the single digits but climb back to this level by end of year as pricing changes approach. That's why I say it's a good 'bet' as there's far less to lose from this level versus say 12p when they f@cked Casc 4 (again) and Casc 5 ended up being nothing remotely like what they were forecasting. It wasn't even gas ffs. Great place for new entrants given what we know about Central already, and there have been no f@ck ups with the well or seemingly the hook up (so far). Highland, that comment isn't quite accurate. I think you mean to say he won't provide single well detail because it shows the extent of some of their development f@ck ups. But of course he will provide CR3 detail if it's successful. You need to always keep in mind that Baay is a conman, so is going to share the good news, and always try to bury any bad news. Currently there's no good news, but CR3 could change all of that.",

Cascadura, Central Block and legacy production are all real, producing and cash-positive, and together they cover debt service - albeit without much slack. That\u2019s exactly why management has prioritised stability over growth at this time. Central Block is already a meaningful cash contributor: while it represents roughly 40\u201345% of volumes, its lower operating costs mean it contributes a higher share of operating cash flow. With the main pipeline runs now complete and only final tie-ins and sign-off remaining, Central Block is well positioned to be the most efficient area for near-term growth. Some recent declines are operational rather than structural. The manufacturing fault on the Cascadura-3 pump is being rectified at no cost, workover options are being evaluated at Cascadura-4, and compression at Cascadura should stabilise deliverability rather than chase aggressive growth there. Central Block remains upside, not existential risk but CR-3 should tell us most of what we need to know for the rest of 2026. I\u2019d rather see TXP survive, de-lever and rebuild by growing Central Block sensibly than chase higher-risk growth elsewhere or be forced into a distressed outcome.",

The compressor will provide pressure stability that will both boost production and stability.

While domestic output remains below past highs, operators are moving ahead with developments that could stabilise supply and extend the life of key infrastructure. bpTT is set to bring its Cypre field online in 2024, with the Mento project expected to follow by 2026. Shell\u2019s Manatee field, a larger offshore development, is targeting first gas in 2027. These timelines reflect a longer build-out cycle, but the government has signalled progress in streamlining approvals to speed up execution. Touchstone Exploration is also expanding onshore activity, with current drilling focused on tying in to midstream infrastructure. With large undeveloped gas reserves just across the maritime border, including the Dragon and Manakin\u2013Cocuina fields, Venezuela offers a clear supply-side opportunity. These fields are close enough to be tied into Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s existing processing and LNG facilities with relatively limited new investment. Touchstone\u2019s leadership has also expressed interest in opportunities tied to Venezuela, noting the size of the reserves and the regional infrastructure advantages. While smaller players face higher entry barriers, alignment between state and corporate interests could open access over time. Touchstone Exploration Inc (LON:TXP) is a Canadian-based, international upstream oil and gas company currently active in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Primera Oil and Gas is the Trinidadian subsidiary of Touchstone.",

Operating cash vs free cash flow You\u2019re absolutely right that TXP has been FCF-negative during a heavy capex phase. That\u2019s not controversial, and it\u2019s been openly stated by management. But that\u2019s a capital allocation choice, not a sign the underlying business can\u2019t generate cash. TXP can cover debt service and opex from operations, and still be FCF-negative if it chooses to reinvest heavily. Those are not mutually exclusive. Debt service vs balance sheet optics. The point I made (and keep making) is narrower than the argument you\u2019re rebutting. I\u2019m not saying TXP is \u201cfinancially strong\u201d in a balance-sheet sense today. I am saying existing production covers debt servicing and running costs. That matters, because it means CR-3 is about upside and inflection, not insolvency. A poor CR-3 outcome does not automatically create a \u201czombie company\u201d That distinction gets lost when everything is framed as binary success/failure. The share price doesn\u2019t reflect \u201ccan the company pay its bills\u201d It reflects, dilution risk, execution fatigue, credibility scars from past guidance and capital intensity vs timing. All fair points but they\u2019re market psychology, not proof the operating base is broken. As for covenant waivers again, not unusual in a scale-up phase following a major acquisition. They\u2019re uncomfortable, but not the same as being unable to service debt. But we\u2019re not cash-dead, and CR-3 does not determine whether the lights stay on. CR-3 determines pricing uplift, speed of deleveraging and whether growth is self-funded or diluted. That\u2019s the distinction I was making and not claiming everything is rosy. Happy to debate numbers, but it helps if we\u2019re debating the same question.",

It was TRIN mgt for the failed acquisition, and yet we have no legal recourse. If Schlumberger are 'taking full responsibility', then what compensation have we received, or is it just a verbal thing said to ConJob Baay.

Central volumes contributed approximately 2,217 boe/d during the third quarter. \u00b7      Petroleum and Natural Gas Sales: Totaled $12.70 million, a 4 percent decrease from $13.25 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter. -     Crude oil sales: $5.84 million from average production of 1,051 bbls/d at an average realized price of $60.30 per barrel. -     NGL sales: $1.34 million from average production volumes of 436 bbls/d at an average realized price of $33.41 per barrel. -     Natural gas sales: $5.52 million from average production of 21.9 MMcf/d (3,654 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.74 per Mcf. \u00b7      Operating Netback: Generated $5.86 million in operating netback, a 21 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas operating expenses. \u00b7      Funds Flow from Operations: Declined to $0.74 million from $3.02 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks, higher cash finance expenses, and increased current income taxes, partially offset by lower transaction costs. \u00b7      Net Loss: Recorded a net loss of $2.06 million ($0.01 per share) compared to net earnings of $1.85 million ($0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations, $1.50 million in additional depletion and depreciation expense, and the absence of a $0.78 million gain on asset disposition recognized in the prior year.\u201d Good luck with that $77.5M of debt!",

I think you need to entirely tune out the fanboy narrative around CR-3 (remember how wrong they got Cas-5) and look again at the balance of risk and reward.

So the new Government is recognising that and helped us with approvals, like certificates for environmental compliance,\u201d Baay said. \u201cWe drilled the first well. We want to drill a second well, really quickly. That process, you know, used to be a nine-month process, and it\u2019s been shrunk down. Now it looks like it\u2019s going to be literally a couple of weeks, maybe a month.\u201d Baay added that the company could see some returns from that activity by the end of February. \u201cWe drilled the first well in December at the central block, and that\u2019s going to come on at the end of February. So you know that\u2019s like, we\u2019re not talking quarters here. We\u2019re talking months and weeks from when we can drill a well to when we get it on production,\u201d he said. Baay said, \u201cThose are the kind of reaction times that I think the new Government is recognising and putting in place the necessary things that we see. So from our point of view, that saves us money and saves us time. From the Government\u2019s point of view, that gets molecules on quicker for all of those suppliers that need them.\u201d The full article is available at https://guardian.co.tt/business/energy-sector-optimistic-about-2026-6.2.2501152.bff3b02b0a",

At worst, they will have the pricing contract changes to save their skin. They just won't be able to drill any new wells until it happens, even with an extra 1mmcf from the compressor, assuming they don't f@ck that up as well. Success with CR3 (above 5mmcf Net), and I imagine this will add 30-50%, depending on whether they get 5mmcf or 10mmcf Net production. As far as gambling goes, it's actually a decent punt. You get your money back in 1 year if CR3 comes up tails. Or you more than double your money in 1 year if it comes up heads. Just a shame that our charlatan CEO f@cked everything at a corporate level and his fanboys refuse to hold the useless, lying pr@t to account.",

Could be a great recovery for TXP holders IMO Only because we\u2019re above the 50dma all eyes will start to look for confirmation of a breakout which IMO will happen in Feb (I\u2019m positioning now, for maximum gains)   These are the levels AI has come up with \u2026 Based on technical data from January 2026, a \"Golden Cross\" for Touchstone Exploration (TXP) occurs when its 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above its 200-day moving average. As of late January 2026, the stock has recently shown short-term strength, crossing above its 50-day MA, but still requires significant upside to trigger a golden cross with the long-term 200-day MA. Required Levels for a Golden Cross (Approximate, Jan 2026) 200-Day Moving Average (Long-Term): Approximately C$0.21 - C$0.23 (Toronto Stock Exchange) 50-Day Moving Average (Short-Term): Currently rising from around C$0.15 - C$0.16 To achieve the Golden Cross: The 50-day MA must rise above the 200-day MA. This requires the share price to maintain recent gains and trade sustainably above the C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 range to pull the 50-day average upward. Current Technical Context (As of Jan 21-24, 2026) Current Price: Trading around C$0.18 Situation: The stock crossed above its 50-day moving average (C$0.15), indicating short-term momentum, but remains significantly below the 200-day moving average (C$0.21). Conclusion: The 50-day MA is still below the 200-day MA, meaning a Golden Cross is not yet confirmed and requires further sustained upward movement. Key Price Levels to Watch Resistance: The 200-day MA at C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 is the primary hurdle for the golden cross. Volume: High trading volume during an upward move is required to confirm the bullish signal. Analyst Target: Analysts have indicated a median 12-month target of 35p (approx CAD) on the London Stock Exchange, which would comfortably trigger a golden cross if achieved.",

In the O&G industry, what happens during such periods is that those physically undertaking the  work/assessment become pregnant with inside knowledge and are aware that there are many outsiders willing to \"obtain\" such information for investment purposes, invariably for reward.  It is more than possible that this little sp recovery is down to the leak of such information, which suggests that CR-3 is looking good.  However, how many times over the past 2-3 years have we been in this situation, only to be told that wells have not either not met expectations or encountered problems or some other issue? That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed on this because, as I commented previously, success with CR-3 could see the sp tick up to ca 15p (which would reflect a 50% increase) but more bad news will crater the sp, possibly to below 5p.",

Failing to hedge massive oil volumes while carrying heavy debt, despite explicit warnings. That one is hard to excuse. Nearly killed the company and diluted shareholders massively. The ONP oil sales terms \u2014 absurd. A structure that leaves risk on your books after the oil is supposedly \u201csold\u201d. Handing out an enormous number of investor warrants. A \u201csubstantially oversubscribed\u201d raise \u2014 to quote Manolo \u2014 is not a success when it results in dilution far beyond what was required. Issuing a high-cost bond that was roughly four times larger than needed, supposedly to fund acquisitions. No acquisitions followed. They didn\u2019t even buy back the investor warrants (around 300m, IIRC). Promising to drill Block 107 at IPO, then repeatedly failing to deliver. Year after year of \u201cnext year, Rodney\u201d. And as for the TRIN acquisition \u2014 I still struggle to see how anyone thought that was smart for TXP. No synergy, just added complexity layered onto the same cost base. Central Block, by contrast, is a masterclass in synergy \u2014 exactly what a good acquisition should look like.",

That asymmetry is the whole point. Calling that \u201cgoing to zero risk\u201d without showing a credible path to insolvency is assertion, not argument. Time will tell \u2014 but time tends to reward those who quantify probabilities, not those who rely on being \u201clucky\u201d. If you have better things to do than explain your argument, that\u2019s fine \u2014 but then don\u2019t expect \u201ctrust me, I\u2019ve been lucky\u201d to carry any weight.",

I'm sure the market will take care of it's self this week and we're  getting closer to the FOMO stage with just 14 days till the end of the Month and with PB suggesting production to start the end of February (this does not mean the very last day)  so this IMO could even be late next week or early the following week commencing the 23rd.",

Expectations are being managed, but the prediction last year (see for example the August 2025 presentation) was it would produce 10 million per day and more recently Touchstone has indicated that if four wells are added to Central Block this year production from that block alone could more than double (with the increase attracting a much higher price than existing production). If that happens, and we'll have a better idea once we get the CR3 results, the disasters of 2025 will be well behind us. There's also plenty of gas still to extract from Cascudura, but it makes sense to leave it to 2027 when much higher prices will apply once the existing contract expires. A bonus this year will be if there's a deep oil farm out and some drilling. That's difficult to predict, but after years of decline there's increasing interest in Trinidad (evidenced amongst other things by Exxon's return last August) perhaps in part because of the deep oil discoveries in Guyana etc and the new government's red-tape cutting should help too. Add in the boost from the compressor in May/June and a VAT refund, and it may well be a very good year. Nothing's guaranteed though.",

I\u2019m not dismissing risk; I\u2019m explicitly modelling it. If CR-3 fails, downside is limited to where we are now. If it lands even mid-case, the valuation moves materially. That asymmetry is the whole point. Calling that \u201cgoing to zero risk\u201d without showing a credible path to insolvency is assertion, not argument.

Over the last 20 months, since the attempted TRIN takeover, I have been clear and consistent in my criticism of TXP.  You can say that I just got lucky, but I\u2019ve found that the more critical I am of TXP, the luckier I get.  I still don\u2019t think that the risks outweigh the rewards, even at 9p.  Time will tell whether I get lucky again. What worries me is that you just don\u2019t seem to see the now substantial risk of TXP going to zero (or as near as makes no difference).",

That\u2019s not a gamble, it\u2019s a skewed payoff. Saying \u201c9p is about right\u201d simply restates the current price, not a valuation. The market isn\u2019t declaring CR-3 worthless; it\u2019s withholding value until data arrives. That\u2019s uncertainty pricing, not proof the reward is inadequate. If CR-3 lands anywhere near the mid-case, the maths moves quickly. If it doesn\u2019t, value drops back to where it is now.

Expectations are being managed, but the prediction last year (see for example the August 2025 presentation) was it would produce 10 million per day and more recently Touchstone has indicated that if four wells are added to Central Block this year production from that block alone could more than double (with the increase attracting a much higher price than existing production). If that happens, and we'll have a better idea once we get the CR3 results, the disasters of 2025 will be well behind us. There's also plenty of gas still to extract from Cascudura, but it makes sense to leave it to 2027 when much higher prices will apply once the existing contract expires. A bonus this year will be if there's a deep oil farm out and some drilling. That's difficult to predict, but after years of decline there's increasing interest in Trinidad (evidenced amongst other things by Exxon's return last August) perhaps in part because of the deep oil discoveries in Guyana etc and the new government's red-tape cutting should help too. Add in the boost from the compressor in May/June and a VAT refund, and it may well be a very good year. Nothing's guaranteed though.",

That landscape was, after all, painted for them by Paul Baay.  The brushwork he used for the wall of cash looming on the horizon was just masterful. The last five years have seen Paul Baay presiding over significant operational and financial ineptitude and a pretty slippery communications strategy.  If you think otherwise you are either too close to PB or have just not been paying attention.  Or both.  G_G_G\u2019s ire towards PB is understandable, but he is still missing an important point.  The last five years have also seen it becoming increasingly clear that Ortoire is just not all that.  The money maker is looking more like a money pit (the compressor, for example, just sounds like damage limitation). A false \u201cpoor management/great assets\u201d narrative has definitely kept some folk hanging on in the hope that a change of management would make all the difference or that the assets would grow shareholder value despite the management.  The reality though is that TXP has seen a perfect storm of poor management and marginal assets. It\u2019s all really down to Central Block now.  If TXP cannot successfully reinvent itself around Central Block it is pretty much done and G_G_G is well out of it.",

It\u2019s not only Touchstone that\u2019s been exploring for and finding significant new resources, but the large independents have been buying up assets (Perenco has invested billions over the past couple of years) and the majors have been busy. Exxon returned last August, Shell and BP never left, and Chevron and Total are interested. There\u2019s even an increasing prospect that Trinidad\u2019s refinery will reopen later this year (see https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/After-Years-Offline-Trinidad-Looks-to-Indian-Oil-to-Restart-Refining.amp.html). Oil production is rising again and some major gas projects will soon come on line. Energy still makes up about half the economy and, although there are various ways to further improve the fiscal system, it\u2019s not a bad place to do business (Touchstone, like other producers, has no transportation costs and is paid monthly in US dollars). I\u2019m much more comfortable investing in Trinidad than, say, in a company producing oil in the jungles of Peru. The AIM has its flaws, but plenty of decent companies, including Touchstone, are listed on it. It\u2019s far from untouchable and Warren Buffett, through CalEnergy, had a partnership with Parkmead Group (an AIM company).",

When significant positive change is promised or even just a possibility, it is tempting to load up in anticipation.  More often than not though you are better on the sidelines - in the event of disappointment you are well out while if significant positive change is actually delivered you will understand its significance and be able to get in ahead of those who don\u2019t (likely buying the shares of the inevitable sellers into the news).",

If they have stopped then this might have been because the figures have for a while been showing an industry in decline, due in no small part to T&T\u2019s relatively unfriendly fiscal regime.

It reall is a coin flip in that field though. Sturm, there's a reason why Buffet thinks pe ratios are a waste of time. It's about fcf and when looking at ratios use EV. It takes into account how indebted a company is versus earnings. Agree that CR3 flow rates will be month end at best. I personally think it will be early March, and probably best to report on an extended production rate. That 700k buy overpaid, but good to see a counter to the big seller the past 1-2 weeks.

And, providing the compressor operates as expected, the added production from Casc 4, 5, CR3, even if poor, plus Compressor will keep the sp range bound in the single digits but climb back to this level by end of year as pricing changes approach. That's why I say it's a good 'bet' as there's far less to lose from this level versus say 12p when they f@cked Casc 4 (again) and Casc 5 ended up being nothing remotely like what they were forecasting. It wasn't even gas ffs. Great place for new entrants given what we know about Central already, and there have been no f@ck ups with the well or seemingly the hook up (so far). Highland, that comment isn't quite accurate. I think you mean to say he won't provide single well detail because it shows the extent of some of their development f@ck ups. But of course he will provide CR3 detail if it's successful. You need to always keep in mind that Baay is a conman, so is going to share the good news, and always try to bury any bad news. Currently there's no good news, but CR3 could change all of that.",

Cascadura, Central Block and legacy production are all real, producing and cash-positive, and together they cover debt service - albeit without much slack. That\u2019s exactly why management has prioritised stability over growth at this time. Central Block is already a meaningful cash contributor: while it represents roughly 40\u201345% of volumes, its lower operating costs mean it contributes a higher share of operating cash flow. With the main pipeline runs now complete and only final tie-ins and sign-off remaining, Central Block is well positioned to be the most efficient area for near-term growth. Some recent declines are operational rather than structural. The manufacturing fault on the Cascadura-3 pump is being rectified at no cost, workover options are being evaluated at Cascadura-4, and compression at Cascadura should stabilise deliverability rather than chase aggressive growth there. Central Block remains upside, not existential risk but CR-3 should tell us most of what we need to know for the rest of 2026. I\u2019d rather see TXP survive, de-lever and rebuild by growing Central Block sensibly than chase higher-risk growth elsewhere or be forced into a distressed outcome.",

Note that Central Block, which has the same formation as Cascudura, has a compressor.

The compressor will provide pressure stability that will both boost production and stability.

The issue has been system back-pressure and export constraints, not wells \u201crunning out of gas.\u201d TXP\u2019s setup is also fundamentally different: dedicated infrastructure, controlled inflows, and compression added proactively rather than as a last-ditch optimisation on a dying asset. The rationale for the new compressor comes directly from observed results at Central Block, where compression materially stabilised output across multiple producing wells.

However, at this moment in time, irrespective of the company's financial condition, a negative CR-3 will hurt the sp considerably, hence my \"coin toss\" title.",

While domestic output remains below past highs, operators are moving ahead with developments that could stabilise supply and extend the life of key infrastructure. bpTT is set to bring its Cypre field online in 2024, with the Mento project expected to follow by 2026. Shell\u2019s Manatee field, a larger offshore development, is targeting first gas in 2027. These timelines reflect a longer build-out cycle, but the government has signalled progress in streamlining approvals to speed up execution. Touchstone Exploration is also expanding onshore activity, with current drilling focused on tying in to midstream infrastructure. With large undeveloped gas reserves just across the maritime border, including the Dragon and Manakin\u2013Cocuina fields, Venezuela offers a clear supply-side opportunity. These fields are close enough to be tied into Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s existing processing and LNG facilities with relatively limited new investment. Touchstone\u2019s leadership has also expressed interest in opportunities tied to Venezuela, noting the size of the reserves and the regional infrastructure advantages. While smaller players face higher entry barriers, alignment between state and corporate interests could open access over time. Touchstone Exploration Inc (LON:TXP) is a Canadian-based, international upstream oil and gas company currently active in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Primera Oil and Gas is the Trinidadian subsidiary of Touchstone.",

Operating cash vs free cash flow You\u2019re absolutely right that TXP has been FCF-negative during a heavy capex phase. That\u2019s not controversial, and it\u2019s been openly stated by management. But that\u2019s a capital allocation choice, not a sign the underlying business can\u2019t generate cash. TXP can cover debt service and opex from operations, and still be FCF-negative if it chooses to reinvest heavily. Those are not mutually exclusive. Debt service vs balance sheet optics. The point I made (and keep making) is narrower than the argument you\u2019re rebutting. I\u2019m not saying TXP is \u201cfinancially strong\u201d in a balance-sheet sense today. I am saying existing production covers debt servicing and running costs. That matters, because it means CR-3 is about upside and inflection, not insolvency. A poor CR-3 outcome does not automatically create a \u201czombie company\u201d That distinction gets lost when everything is framed as binary success/failure. The share price doesn\u2019t reflect \u201ccan the company pay its bills\u201d It reflects, dilution risk, execution fatigue, credibility scars from past guidance and capital intensity vs timing. All fair points but they\u2019re market psychology, not proof the operating base is broken. As for covenant waivers again, not unusual in a scale-up phase following a major acquisition. They\u2019re uncomfortable, but not the same as being unable to service debt. But we\u2019re not cash-dead, and CR-3 does not determine whether the lights stay on. CR-3 determines pricing uplift, speed of deleveraging and whether growth is self-funded or diluted. That\u2019s the distinction I was making and not claiming everything is rosy. Happy to debate numbers, but it helps if we\u2019re debating the same question.",

          "content": "no it's conjobbaay just talking **** again. i mean venezuela now, what a ****. john27, you of all people should be the last person talking about how we can cover this and that through cashflow. the number of times discord members have shouted down people with such numbers is quite ridiculous. and none of them have come remotely close to the appalling figures that have ended up being reported. if we were so financially sound, we wouldn't be sitting in single digits after drilling such a promising well. simple as that. as for the numbers you are quoting, there's a big difference between operating income and how much cash we're generating. here's your reality check: overview: based on the most recent rns filings (up to q3 2025, released in november 2025), touchstone exploration is currently in a \"heavy investment\" phase. while production is scaling up, free cash flow remains negative because capital expenditures (drilling and acquisitions) are currently outstripping the cash generated from operations. note on cash generation: the company uses \"funds flow from operations\" as its primary cash metric. free cash flow (fcf) here is estimated by subtracting capital expenditures from funds flow. as you can see, the fcf has been increasingly negative over the past 12 months as they ramp up drilling at cascadura. recent quarter analysis: q3 2025 the most recent quarter shows a company under temporary financial pressure but with growing asset scale: - net debt surge: debt climbed to $77.75 million, largely due to a $12.5 million convertible debenture and the earlier $30 million acquisition of the \"central block.\" - production: averaged 5,141 boe/d. while this is an increase over q2, the \"funds flow\" dropped to just $0.74m due to higher financing costs (interest on that new debt) and higher taxes. - the \"waiver\": crucially, touchstone had to obtain a financial covenant waiver from its lender for the end of 2025, suggesting they are operating very close to their debt limits. next 12 months: outlook for 2026 - the health of the company over the next 12 months depends entirely on converting recent drilling into consistent cash: - revenue growth: analysts project revenue growth of ~49% as new wells like cascadura-5 and carapal ridge-3 (results announced jan 2026) contribute to the full-year total. - cash inflection: the company expects to generate roughly $22 million in funds flow for the full year 2025/2026. if they keep capital spending around the $23m mark (as budgeted), they will be roughly cash-flow neutral or slightly negative until the next major production step-change. - debt reduction: management\u2019s goal is to bring net debt back down toward $30 million by the end of 2025/early 2026, though this relies on no further major acquisition spending. summary: touchstone is \"asset rich but cash tight.\" they have successfully grown production, but the cost of that growth has pushed debt to a peak. they need a smooth, high-volume product",

Always DYOR and remember that BB rampers (even more so Telegram and Discord rampers) are bad for your wealth. No one should ever commit a significant amount of capital to shares like these. Even my beloved PTAL, as a single country play, is not for widows and orphans. Stock selection should really just be a question of choosing between Newmont and Barrick. Or you could have both. There you go - job done, PF secured - now you can go outside and play.\u201d As you can see I was quite positive on Newmont and Barrick from my own sector.  If folk had followed my suggestion and forgotten about AIM crap they would have more than doubled their money.",

Central volumes contributed approximately 2,217 boe/d during the third quarter. \u00b7      Petroleum and Natural Gas Sales: Totaled $12.70 million, a 4 percent decrease from $13.25 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter. -     Crude oil sales: $5.84 million from average production of 1,051 bbls/d at an average realized price of $60.30 per barrel. -     NGL sales: $1.34 million from average production volumes of 436 bbls/d at an average realized price of $33.41 per barrel. -     Natural gas sales: $5.52 million from average production of 21.9 MMcf/d (3,654 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.74 per Mcf. \u00b7      Operating Netback: Generated $5.86 million in operating netback, a 21 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas operating expenses. \u00b7      Funds Flow from Operations: Declined to $0.74 million from $3.02 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks, higher cash finance expenses, and increased current income taxes, partially offset by lower transaction costs. \u00b7      Net Loss: Recorded a net loss of $2.06 million ($0.01 per share) compared to net earnings of $1.85 million ($0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations, $1.50 million in additional depletion and depreciation expense, and the absence of a $0.78 million gain on asset disposition recognized in the prior year.\u201d Good luck with that $77.5M of debt!",

You are not just negative all the time, you are also becoming extremely boring  which the 2 usually go hand in hand. Hundreds of posts and many hrs here yet you have zero intention on buying and you want people to believe what you say . That alone say just how boring you are to do that when there is always other investments you can work on or research to better understand a company.   Always best to avoid people like yourself as they just drag you down . Your history is truly shocking.",

Good luck with that.  A marginally commercial CR-3 would still leave TXP a steep hill to climb. Only a very robust performance from CR-3 is going to re-establish a growth trajectory here.  I think you need to entirely tune out the fanboy narrative around CR-3 (remember how wrong they got Cas-5) and look again at the balance of risk and reward.  It looks like a coin toss to me, so I just don\u2019t see the attraction.  It\u2019s speculation, not investment.

So the new Government is recognising that and helped us with approvals, like certificates for environmental compliance,\u201d Baay said. \u201cWe drilled the first well. We want to drill a second well, really quickly. That process, you know, used to be a nine-month process, and it\u2019s been shrunk down. Now it looks like it\u2019s going to be literally a couple of weeks, maybe a month.\u201d Baay added that the company could see some returns from that activity by the end of February. \u201cWe drilled the first well in December at the central block, and that\u2019s going to come on at the end of February. So you know that\u2019s like, we\u2019re not talking quarters here. We\u2019re talking months and weeks from when we can drill a well to when we get it on production,\u201d he said. Baay said, \u201cThose are the kind of reaction times that I think the new Government is recognising and putting in place the necessary things that we see. So from our point of view, that saves us money and saves us time. From the Government\u2019s point of view, that gets molecules on quicker for all of those suppliers that need them.\u201d The full article is available at https://guardian.co.tt/business/energy-sector-optimistic-about-2026-6.2.2501152.bff3b02b0a",

At worst, they will have the pricing contract changes to save their skin. They just won't be able to drill any new wells until it happens, even with an extra 1mmcf from the compressor, assuming they don't f@ck that up as well. Success with CR3 (above 5mmcf Net), and I imagine this will add 30-50%, depending on whether they get 5mmcf or 10mmcf Net production. As far as gambling goes, it's actually a decent punt. You get your money back in 1 year if CR3 comes up tails. Or you more than double your money in 1 year if it comes up heads. Just a shame that our charlatan CEO f@cked everything at a corporate level and his fanboys refuse to hold the useless, lying pr@t to account.",

Could be a great recovery for TXP holders IMO Only because we\u2019re above the 50dma all eyes will start to look for confirmation of a breakout which IMO will happen in Feb (I\u2019m positioning now, for maximum gains)   These are the levels AI has come up with \u2026 Based on technical data from January 2026, a \"Golden Cross\" for Touchstone Exploration (TXP) occurs when its 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above its 200-day moving average. As of late January 2026, the stock has recently shown short-term strength, crossing above its 50-day MA, but still requires significant upside to trigger a golden cross with the long-term 200-day MA. Required Levels for a Golden Cross (Approximate, Jan 2026) 200-Day Moving Average (Long-Term): Approximately C$0.21 - C$0.23 (Toronto Stock Exchange) 50-Day Moving Average (Short-Term): Currently rising from around C$0.15 - C$0.16 To achieve the Golden Cross: The 50-day MA must rise above the 200-day MA. This requires the share price to maintain recent gains and trade sustainably above the C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 range to pull the 50-day average upward. Current Technical Context (As of Jan 21-24, 2026) Current Price: Trading around C$0.18 Situation: The stock crossed above its 50-day moving average (C$0.15), indicating short-term momentum, but remains significantly below the 200-day moving average (C$0.21). Conclusion: The 50-day MA is still below the 200-day MA, meaning a Golden Cross is not yet confirmed and requires further sustained upward movement. Key Price Levels to Watch Resistance: The 200-day MA at C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 is the primary hurdle for the golden cross. Volume: High trading volume during an upward move is required to confirm the bullish signal. Analyst Target: Analysts have indicated a median 12-month target of 35p (approx CAD) on the London Stock Exchange, which would comfortably trigger a golden cross if achieved.",

It is more than possible that this little sp recovery is down to the leak of such information, which suggests that CR-3 is looking good.  However, how many times over the past 2-3 years have we been in this situation, only to be told that wells have not either not met expectations or encountered problems or some other issue? That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed on this because, as I commented previously, success with CR-3 could see the sp tick up to ca 15p (which would reflect a 50% increase) but more bad news will crater the sp, possibly to below 5p.",

Failing to hedge massive oil volumes while carrying heavy debt, despite explicit warnings. That one is hard to excuse. Nearly killed the company and diluted shareholders massively. The ONP oil sales terms \u2014 absurd. A structure that leaves risk on your books after the oil is supposedly \u201csold\u201d. Handing out an enormous number of investor warrants. A \u201csubstantially oversubscribed\u201d raise \u2014 to quote Manolo \u2014 is not a success when it results in dilution far beyond what was required. Issuing a high-cost bond that was roughly four times larger than needed, supposedly to fund acquisitions. No acquisitions followed. They didn\u2019t even buy back the investor warrants (around 300m, IIRC). Promising to drill Block 107 at IPO, then repeatedly failing to deliver. Year after year of \u201cnext year, Rodney\u201d. And as for the TRIN acquisition \u2014 I still struggle to see how anyone thought that was smart for TXP. No synergy, just added complexity layered onto the same cost base. Central Block, by contrast, is a masterclass in synergy \u2014 exactly what a good acquisition should look like.",

Failing to hedge massive oil volumes while carrying heavy debt, despite explicit warnings. That one is hard to excuse. Nearly killed the company and diluted shareholders massively. The ONP oil sales terms \u2014 absurd. A structure that leaves risk on your books after the oil is supposedly \u201csold\u201d. Handing out an enormous number of investor warrants. A \u201csubstantially oversubscribed\u201d raise \u2014 to quote Manolo \u2014 is not a success when it results in dilution far beyond what was required. Issuing a high-cost bond that was roughly four times larger than needed, supposedly to fund acquisitions. No acquisitions followed. They didn\u2019t even buy back the investor warrants (around 300m, IIRC). Promising to drill Block 107 at IPO, then repeatedly failing to deliver. Year after year of \u201cnext year, Rodney\u201d. And as for the TRIN acquisition \u2014 I still struggle to see how anyone thought that was smart for TXP. No synergy, just added complexity layered onto the same cost base. Central Block, by contrast, is a masterclass in synergy \u2014 exactly what a good acquisition should look like.",

I\u2019m not dismissing risk; I\u2019m explicitly modelling it. If CR-3 fails, downside is limited to where we are now. If it lands even mid-case, the valuation moves materially. That asymmetry is the whole point. Calling that \u201cgoing to zero risk\u201d without showing a credible path to insolvency is assertion, not argument. Time will tell \u2014 but time tends to reward those who quantify probabilities, not those who rely on being \u201clucky\u201d. If you have better things to do than explain your argument, that\u2019s fine \u2014 but then don\u2019t expect \u201ctrust me, I\u2019ve been lucky\u201d to carry any weight.",

CR-3 isn\u2019t about \u201cshort-term success\u201d; it\u2019s about re-rating optionality. The company can service debt and operate without CR-3 \u2014 what CR-3 changes is how quickly and how decisively the balance sheet and equity narrative improve. Calling it a \u201ccoin toss\u201d ignores the asymmetry. A failed well caps downside near today\u2019s valuation; a commercially successful well materially shifts cash flow, probabilities, and pricing assumptions \u2014 as we\u2019ve just shown numerically. That\u2019s not a gamble, it\u2019s a skewed payoff. Saying \u201c9p is about right\u201d simply restates the current price, not a valuation. The market isn\u2019t declaring CR-3 worthless; it\u2019s withholding value until data arrives. That\u2019s uncertainty pricing, not proof the reward is inadequate. If CR-3 lands anywhere near the mid-case, the maths moves quickly. If it doesn\u2019t, value drops back to where it is now. That\u2019s exactly why this isn\u2019t a binary survival bet \u2014 it\u2019s a de-risking catalyst with disproportionate upside.",

Expectations are being managed, but the prediction last year (see for example the August 2025 presentation) was it would produce 10 million per day and more recently Touchstone has indicated that if four wells are added to Central Block this year production from that block alone could more than double (with the increase attracting a much higher price than existing production). If that happens, and we'll have a better idea once we get the CR3 results, the disasters of 2025 will be well behind us. There's also plenty of gas still to extract from Cascudura, but it makes sense to leave it to 2027 when much higher prices will apply once the existing contract expires. A bonus this year will be if there's a deep oil farm out and some drilling. That's difficult to predict, but after years of decline there's increasing interest in Trinidad (evidenced amongst other things by Exxon's return last August) perhaps in part because of the deep oil discoveries in Guyana etc and the new government's red-tape cutting should help too. Add in the boost from the compressor in May/June and a VAT refund, and it may well be a very good year. Nothing's guaranteed though.",

Repeating \u201c9p is about right\u201d and invoking a vague risk of \u201cgoing to zero\u201d doesn\u2019t make the case unless you explain how that happens \u2014 mechanically and financially. I\u2019m not dismissing risk; I\u2019m explicitly modelling it. If CR-3 fails, downside is limited to where we are now. If it lands even mid-case, the valuation moves materially. That asymmetry is the whole point. Calling that \u201cgoing to zero risk\u201d without showing a credible path to insolvency is assertion, not argument. Time will tell \u2014 but time tends to reward those who quantify probabilities, not those who rely on being \u201clucky\u201d. If you have better things to do than explain your argument, that\u2019s fine \u2014 but then don\u2019t expect \u201ctrust me, I\u2019ve been lucky\u201d to carry any weight.",

CR-3 isn\u2019t about \u201cshort-term success\u201d; it\u2019s about re-rating optionality. The company can service debt and operate without CR-3 \u2014 what CR-3 changes is how quickly and how decisively the balance sheet and equity narrative improve. Calling it a \u201ccoin toss\u201d ignores the asymmetry. A failed well caps downside near today\u2019s valuation; a commercially successful well materially shifts cash flow, probabilities, and pricing assumptions \u2014 as we\u2019ve just shown numerically. That\u2019s not a gamble, it\u2019s a skewed payoff. Saying \u201c9p is about right\u201d simply restates the current price, not a valuation. The market isn\u2019t declaring CR-3 worthless; it\u2019s withholding value until data arrives. That\u2019s uncertainty pricing, not proof the reward is inadequate. If CR-3 lands anywhere near the mid-case, the maths moves quickly. If it doesn\u2019t, value drops back to where it is now. That\u2019s exactly why this isn\u2019t a binary survival bet \u2014 it\u2019s a de-risking catalyst with disproportionate upside.",

Expectations are being managed, but the prediction last year (see for example the August 2025 presentation) was it would produce 10 million per day and more recently Touchstone has indicated that if four wells are added to Central Block this year production from that block alone could more than double (with the increase attracting a much higher price than existing production). If that happens, and we'll have a better idea once we get the CR3 results, the disasters of 2025 will be well behind us. There's also plenty of gas still to extract from Cascudura, but it makes sense to leave it to 2027 when much higher prices will apply once the existing contract expires. A bonus this year will be if there's a deep oil farm out and some drilling. That's difficult to predict, but after years of decline there's increasing interest in Trinidad (evidenced amongst other things by Exxon's return last August) perhaps in part because of the deep oil discoveries in Guyana etc and the new government's red-tape cutting should help too. Add in the boost from the compressor in May/June and a VAT refund, and it may well be a very good year. Nothing's guaranteed though.",

Everyone is, of course, entitled to their own view. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk of blurring genuine frustration with hindsight bias. CR-3 will ultimately be judged on data, not sentiment. Until then, everyone has to manage their own risk and exposure. Without criticism, I\u2019ve always taken note of your frustrations and have raised some directly with TXP.

I also genuinely feel for your losses as many here have suffered in different ways after misreading the landscape back in 2021. On the wider point, strong language aside, accusations of deliberate market-misleading are serious and, in the absence of specifics, inevitably contentious. Everyone is, of course, entitled to their own view. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk of blurring genuine frustration with hindsight bias. CR-3 will ultimately be judged on data, not sentiment. Until then, everyone has to manage their own risk and exposure. Without criticism, I\u2019ve always taken note of your frustrations and have raised some directly with TXP. Having spent a full day on site with Paul and the team, the only feedback I can offer is that the focus is firmly on Central Block and on stabilising current declines, something that should become clearer over the coming 2\u20133 weeks.",

It\u2019s not only Touchstone that\u2019s been exploring for and finding significant new resources, but the large independents have been buying up assets (Perenco has invested billions over the past couple of years) and the majors have been busy. Exxon returned last August, Shell and BP never left, and Chevron and Total are interested. There\u2019s even an increasing prospect that Trinidad\u2019s refinery will reopen later this year (see https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/After-Years-Offline-Trinidad-Looks-to-Indian-Oil-to-Restart-Refining.amp.html). Oil production is rising again and some major gas projects will soon come on line. Energy still makes up about half the economy and, although there are various ways to further improve the fiscal system, it\u2019s not a bad place to do business (Touchstone, like other producers, has no transportation costs and is paid monthly in US dollars). I\u2019m much more comfortable investing in Trinidad than, say, in a company producing oil in the jungles of Peru. The AIM has its flaws, but plenty of decent companies, including Touchstone, are listed on it. It\u2019s far from untouchable and Warren Buffett, through CalEnergy, had a partnership with Parkmead Group (an AIM company).",

Working from historical FCF allows you to draw a more reliable trajectory while also assessing what was delivered at each stage against what was then expected. When significant positive change is promised or even just a possibility, it is tempting to load up in anticipation.  More often than not though you are better on the sidelines - in the event of disappointment you are well out while if significant positive change is actually delivered you will understand its significance and be able to get in ahead of those who don\u2019t (likely buying the shares of the inevitable sellers into the news).",

Valuing CR3 at ~12p on a P/E of 3 is more or less equivalent to discounting the cash flows at roughly 25% IRR on a DCF basis (depending on the time frame). So that's pretty harsh :) So P/E of 3 /25% is my own go to for small cap - and totally subjective. The fun bit happens IF they at some point produce e.g. 60 mmcf across facilities at a fixed (higher) gas price - then I'd apply a P/E of mayby 6 - 8.",

And, providing the compressor operates as expected, the added production from Casc 4, 5, CR3, even if poor, plus Compressor will keep the sp range bound in the single digits but climb back to this level by end of year as pricing changes approach. That's why I say it's a good 'bet' as there's far less to lose from this level versus say 12p when they f@cked Casc 4 (again) and Casc 5 ended up being nothing remotely like what they were forecasting. It wasn't even gas ffs. Great place for new entrants given what we know about Central already, and there have been no f@ck ups with the well or seemingly the hook up (so far). Highland, that comment isn't quite accurate. I think you mean to say he won't provide single well detail because it shows the extent of some of their development f@ck ups. But of course he will provide CR3 detail if it's successful. You need to always keep in mind that Baay is a conman, so is going to share the good news, and always try to bury any bad news. Currently there's no good news, but CR3 could change all of that.",

Cascadura, Central Block and legacy production are all real, producing and cash-positive, and together they cover debt service - albeit without much slack. That\u2019s exactly why management has prioritised stability over growth at this time. Central Block is already a meaningful cash contributor: while it represents roughly 40\u201345% of volumes, its lower operating costs mean it contributes a higher share of operating cash flow. With the main pipeline runs now complete and only final tie-ins and sign-off remaining, Central Block is well positioned to be the most efficient area for near-term growth. Some recent declines are operational rather than structural. The manufacturing fault on the Cascadura-3 pump is being rectified at no cost, workover options are being evaluated at Cascadura-4, and compression at Cascadura should stabilise deliverability rather than chase aggressive growth there. Central Block remains upside, not existential risk but CR-3 should tell us most of what we need to know for the rest of 2026. I\u2019d rather see TXP survive, de-lever and rebuild by growing Central Block sensibly than chase higher-risk growth elsewhere or be forced into a distressed outcome.",

While domestic output remains below past highs, operators are moving ahead with developments that could stabilise supply and extend the life of key infrastructure. bpTT is set to bring its Cypre field online in 2024, with the Mento project expected to follow by 2026. Shell\u2019s Manatee field, a larger offshore development, is targeting first gas in 2027. These timelines reflect a longer build-out cycle, but the government has signalled progress in streamlining approvals to speed up execution. Touchstone Exploration is also expanding onshore activity, with current drilling focused on tying in to midstream infrastructure. With large undeveloped gas reserves just across the maritime border, including the Dragon and Manakin\u2013Cocuina fields, Venezuela offers a clear supply-side opportunity. These fields are close enough to be tied into Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s existing processing and LNG facilities with relatively limited new investment. Touchstone\u2019s leadership has also expressed interest in opportunities tied to Venezuela, noting the size of the reserves and the regional infrastructure advantages. While smaller players face higher entry barriers, alignment between state and corporate interests could open access over time. Touchstone Exploration Inc (LON:TXP) is a Canadian-based, international upstream oil and gas company currently active in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Primera Oil and Gas is the Trinidadian subsidiary of Touchstone.",

Operating cash vs free cash flow You\u2019re absolutely right that TXP has been FCF-negative during a heavy capex phase. That\u2019s not controversial, and it\u2019s been openly stated by management. But that\u2019s a capital allocation choice, not a sign the underlying business can\u2019t generate cash. TXP can cover debt service and opex from operations, and still be FCF-negative if it chooses to reinvest heavily. Those are not mutually exclusive. Debt service vs balance sheet optics. The point I made (and keep making) is narrower than the argument you\u2019re rebutting. I\u2019m not saying TXP is \u201cfinancially strong\u201d in a balance-sheet sense today. I am saying existing production covers debt servicing and running costs. That matters, because it means CR-3 is about upside and inflection, not insolvency. A poor CR-3 outcome does not automatically create a \u201czombie company\u201d That distinction gets lost when everything is framed as binary success/failure. The share price doesn\u2019t reflect \u201ccan the company pay its bills\u201d It reflects, dilution risk, execution fatigue, credibility scars from past guidance and capital intensity vs timing. All fair points but they\u2019re market psychology, not proof the operating base is broken. As for covenant waivers again, not unusual in a scale-up phase following a major acquisition. They\u2019re uncomfortable, but not the same as being unable to service debt. But we\u2019re not cash-dead, and CR-3 does not determine whether the lights stay on. CR-3 determines pricing uplift, speed of deleveraging and whether growth is self-funded or diluted. That\u2019s the distinction I was making and not claiming everything is rosy. Happy to debate numbers, but it helps if we\u2019re debating the same question.",

And it's not even the gas they were chasing, so points to them having f'all idea of the geology. And then if you frame the f'all production with close to $20m in Capex plus 9 months of wasted production (even though it's f'all), you get what could be described as unmitigated clusterf@ck of failures of mgt and our geo teams. As for the 'd @g at my homework' excuses, well, we've heard so many over the years, haven't we? It was the broker's fault for the failed raise, and yet we have no legal recourse. It was TRIN mgt for the failed acquisition, and yet we have no legal recourse. If Schlumberger are 'taking full responsibility', then what compensation have we received, or is it just a verbal thing said to ConJob Baay. The drilling mud from what I understand, was cutting corners on costs, alongside the re-entering a f@cked hole, which we know was the case. Senior mgt failures! I hate to even think where the sp would be if we had even a semi-competent senior mgt team.",

          "content": "whilst i believe that failure at cr3 (like the failures of casc 3-5) would result in a sp drop back to the 6-7p range, i do agree that we would not be a 'going concern'. we'd be able to repay the loan interest and principal amounts required, and then pricing contract changes would kick in next year to allow for one or two more wells. but there would not be any cash to go after more production this year imo, as the compressor still isn't fully paid. and before anyone wants to argue that casc 3-5 weren't failures, they were **** wells, and the only evidence i need to support this assertion is the sp reaction after they were announced with garble, garble baay b@ll****. he's hiding their performance for a reason. and the other thing worth noting is all the 'experts' who claimed we were making $x easily, well no-one has been remotely near the ****house numbers they have been sharing with the market over the past 12 months. this is why the only thing that can be trusted is when it's in black and white. baay's b@ll**** to fanboys over the years has been appalling, and yet they still spout his cr@p like it's fact. and even when it's in black and white, you still need to wonder whether something is missing e.g. failed raise, hidden loan terms etc. the sp is single digits because of the useless, lying f@ck that is our ceo. he's a charlatan who talks utter ****e to hide bad news and keep pis on the hook. the assets have huge 'potential'. but they always have, and now we have central, and yet look at the sp. that's the mgt factor at play. central success is critical to start a climb back into the mid-teens, and with another two decent central wells, back into the 20's and staying there (or better). on my calendar the results will be early march. they'll need to flow test for a week or two before reporting, as hook-up appears to be end-february. that's my reasoning. anything above 5mmcf (net) and i'll put my neck out and say 13-14p. and anywhere near 10mmcf (net) i'll go with 15-16p. obviously both will get another shot in the arm with an announcement of another central well being spud. for any gamblers, the odds are quite good. if cr3 is **** you get your money back in 12 months with pricing changes. if it's good or great you'll more than double your money in 12 months. aimho gla",

Central volumes contributed approximately 2,217 boe/d during the third quarter. \u00b7      Petroleum and Natural Gas Sales: Totaled $12.70 million, a 4 percent decrease from $13.25 million recorded in the comparative prior year quarter. -     Crude oil sales: $5.84 million from average production of 1,051 bbls/d at an average realized price of $60.30 per barrel. -     NGL sales: $1.34 million from average production volumes of 436 bbls/d at an average realized price of $33.41 per barrel. -     Natural gas sales: $5.52 million from average production of 21.9 MMcf/d (3,654 boe/d) at an average realized price of $2.74 per Mcf. \u00b7      Operating Netback: Generated $5.86 million in operating netback, a 21 percent decrease from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to decreased petroleum and natural gas sales and related royalties and increased natural gas operating expenses. \u00b7      Funds Flow from Operations: Declined to $0.74 million from $3.02 million in the prior year equivalent quarter, largely driven by lower operating netbacks, higher cash finance expenses, and increased current income taxes, partially offset by lower transaction costs. \u00b7      Net Loss: Recorded a net loss of $2.06 million ($0.01 per share) compared to net earnings of $1.85 million ($0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 2024. The variance was primarily driven by the decrease in year-over-year funds flow from operations, $1.50 million in additional depletion and depreciation expense, and the absence of a $0.78 million gain on asset disposition recognized in the prior year.\u201d Good luck with that $77.5M of debt!",

The very fact they wish to save investor's  ( which is such an embarrassing statement to come out with ) as that has never happened, purely because investor's have already made up their minds how they wish to play . You are not just negative all the time, you are also becoming extremely boring  which the 2 usually go hand in hand. Hundreds of posts and many hrs here yet you have zero intention on buying and you want people to believe what you say . That alone say just how boring you are to do that when there is always other investments you can work on or research to better understand a company.   Always best to avoid people like yourself as they just drag you down . Your history is truly shocking.",

But as we start to ramp up here with the new acquisition we\u2019ve done, and as we do more drilling, we use more local content\u2014which is also a tricky term in Trinidad, because local content can be \u2018local content\u2019 and \u2018local local content\u2019 right down to the neighbourhoods we operate in. As we move out of an area and into another, there is a perception that some of the jobs are lost, but generally, they get picked up wherever we\u2019re moving to.\u201d Baay said one of the major recent developments at the company has been the completed drilling of the Central Block, about which he said he was excited, despite the slow start; he predicted a busy 2026.",

So the new Government is recognising that and helped us with approvals, like certificates for environmental compliance,\u201d Baay said. \u201cWe drilled the first well. We want to drill a second well, really quickly. That process, you know, used to be a nine-month process, and it\u2019s been shrunk down. Now it looks like it\u2019s going to be literally a couple of weeks, maybe a month.\u201d Baay added that the company could see some returns from that activity by the end of February. \u201cWe drilled the first well in December at the central block, and that\u2019s going to come on at the end of February. So you know that\u2019s like, we\u2019re not talking quarters here. We\u2019re talking months and weeks from when we can drill a well to when we get it on production,\u201d he said. Baay said, \u201cThose are the kind of reaction times that I think the new Government is recognising and putting in place the necessary things that we see. So from our point of view, that saves us money and saves us time. From the Government\u2019s point of view, that gets molecules on quicker for all of those suppliers that need them.\u201d The full article is available at https://guardian.co.tt/business/energy-sector-optimistic-about-2026-6.2.2501152.bff3b02b0a",

At worst, they will have the pricing contract changes to save their skin. They just won't be able to drill any new wells until it happens, even with an extra 1mmcf from the compressor, assuming they don't f@ck that up as well. Success with CR3 (above 5mmcf Net), and I imagine this will add 30-50%, depending on whether they get 5mmcf or 10mmcf Net production. As far as gambling goes, it's actually a decent punt. You get your money back in 1 year if CR3 comes up tails. Or you more than double your money in 1 year if it comes up heads. Just a shame that our charlatan CEO f@cked everything at a corporate level and his fanboys refuse to hold the useless, lying pr@t to account.",

Could be a great recovery for TXP holders IMO Only because we\u2019re above the 50dma all eyes will start to look for confirmation of a breakout which IMO will happen in Feb (I\u2019m positioning now, for maximum gains)   These are the levels AI has come up with \u2026 Based on technical data from January 2026, a \"Golden Cross\" for Touchstone Exploration (TXP) occurs when its 50-day moving average (MA) crosses above its 200-day moving average. As of late January 2026, the stock has recently shown short-term strength, crossing above its 50-day MA, but still requires significant upside to trigger a golden cross with the long-term 200-day MA. Required Levels for a Golden Cross (Approximate, Jan 2026) 200-Day Moving Average (Long-Term): Approximately C$0.21 - C$0.23 (Toronto Stock Exchange) 50-Day Moving Average (Short-Term): Currently rising from around C$0.15 - C$0.16 To achieve the Golden Cross: The 50-day MA must rise above the 200-day MA. This requires the share price to maintain recent gains and trade sustainably above the C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 range to pull the 50-day average upward. Current Technical Context (As of Jan 21-24, 2026) Current Price: Trading around C$0.18 Situation: The stock crossed above its 50-day moving average (C$0.15), indicating short-term momentum, but remains significantly below the 200-day moving average (C$0.21). Conclusion: The 50-day MA is still below the 200-day MA, meaning a Golden Cross is not yet confirmed and requires further sustained upward movement. Key Price Levels to Watch Resistance: The 200-day MA at C$0.21\u2013C$0.23 is the primary hurdle for the golden cross. Volume: High trading volume during an upward move is required to confirm the bullish signal. Analyst Target: Analysts have indicated a median 12-month target of 35p (approx CAD) on the London Stock Exchange, which would comfortably trigger a golden cross if achieved.",

In the O&G industry, what happens during such periods is that those physically undertaking the  work/assessment become pregnant with inside knowledge and are aware that there are many outsiders willing to \"obtain\" such information for investment purposes, invariably for reward.  It is more than possible that this little sp recovery is down to the leak of such information, which suggests that CR-3 is looking good.  However, how many times over the past 2-3 years have we been in this situation, only to be told that wells have not either not met expectations or encountered problems or some other issue? That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed on this because, as I commented previously, success with CR-3 could see the sp tick up to ca 15p (which would reflect a 50% increase) but more bad news will crater the sp, possibly to below 5p.",
