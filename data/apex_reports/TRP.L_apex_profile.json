The process of getting government approvals has taken longer than we would have hoped, and this has somewhat delayed our operational plans. However, the approval time frames so far are not unusual and we believe these processes are still on track in both cases.\nCameroon\nWe have received a copy of the Prime Minister's instruction to the Minister of Mines, Industry and Technological Development (\"MINMIDT\") to approve both a one-year extension to the initial exploration period of our Thali license and also the farm-out of a 42.5% interest in the license to Prime Global Energies Limited (\"Prime\") as we announced in January. Our understanding is that the President has also approved this and the instruction is now being relayed back to MINMIDT, but since we are not a party to the internal processes of government we can say no more than this. Shareholders should understand that the Cameroon government has quite formal approval processes, and as with many governments the elapsed time for them can be lengthy even when the process is positive.\nIn order to minimise the time between approval and drilling, we have already commenced well planning and contract negotiations for both rig and services, which culminated in an award to ADES for the provision of a rig, originally intended to be the Admarine 510, for mobilisation in October 2025. We now expect to use a different ADES rig, and ADES has a number of alternatives available, having recently completed the take-over of Shelf Drilling's West African fleet. Therefore we do not expect the approval timing to create a problem with the availability of a rig, but obviously the timing and choice of the rig will reflect both the approval timing and also the call-off times for services under the various service contracts. The major service contracts are now almost entirely agreed, and we will announce when each is signed, but obligations under those contracts only begin when we call for the services, with lead times of up to three months for most of those services, so this will also reflect the minimum time between approvals and being able to commence drilling operations.\nFor this reason, we now expect drilling to commence in the first quarter of 2026 rather than the last quarter of 2025. While we will let shareholders know when the major service contracts are finalised, we do not intend to keep updating our timing estimates as this will depend on the timing of approvals and also the optimal rig availability. As soon as we have finalised the rig timing we will make a further announcement. We remain completely confident about drilling the NJOM-3 well, and we are fully committed to doing so as soon as possible.\nAs previously explained, we also have two parallel sets of bank discussions underway with multiple banks, one for longer term development financing of the next three wells we have planned for the Njonji structure; and one for shorter term development, if this should prove economic.\nNamibia\nIn Namibia, we received the confirmation from the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (\"MIME\") of our entry into the first renewal period of the PEL96 license. Getting the consent of our partners to our farm-out to Prime, and also the acquisition of an extra 5% interest from our local partner, has taken a bit of time due to the changes of management at the national oil company NAMCOR, but this process is now almost complete. We understand that a draft deed of assignment covering both transactions is now ready for NAMCOR's new top management and, once approved, this will be passed on to MIME. We are liaising regularly with both NAMCOR and MIME, and note that other farm-outs have taken a similar length of time to get completed, even before the recent changes at both MIME and NAMCOR.\nIn the meantime, we are continuing our work identifying additional data that we can use to narrow down further the area within the license where we would like to acquire new 3D seismic data. Whilst realistically we don't envision it being possible to acquire this new 3D seismic data before the winter of 2026/2027, we are pleased to see that some of our neighbours are also interested in new data acquisition in the area, which should reduce costs for all.\nSouth Africa\nIn South Africa, the operator of our Algoa-Gamtoos joint venture license, New Age Energy Algoa (Pty) Ltd (\"NewAge\"), is still in discussions with a potential partner but these discussions do not presently seem to be very productive, despite draft documents having been prepared. This has been part of a larger farm-out process, which has been underway for some time, seeking financing at least for the current phase of 3D seismic data acquisition over our 1.4 billion barrel deep-water slope and floor fan leads, and some repayment of back costs. We are now seeing new interest from other parties, which is very much influenced by the gradual resolution of legal issues in South Africa regarding the implementation of the new petroleum law and in particular the environmental regulations. Nevertheless, we expect this to continue to be a slow process until the legal issues have been fully resolved.\nCorporate\nGiven our expectation that both of the farm-out transactions will be completed reasonably quickly, which as previously disclosed will generate significant funds for the company and especially for the NJOM-3 work programme, we have wished to avoid raising additional equity funds despite the obvious need to maintain and increase expenditure in order to be ready for drilling as soon as government approvals are obtained. Our solution has been a convertible loan facility, which may be converted to equity at a premium or simply repaid in future. In general, we continue to seek to raise financing at the asset level where possible, as we did with the Prime transactions, and to minimise equity dilution at the corporate level.\nWe are very excited about the months ahead and the opportunities that 2026 will bring.\nJeremy Asher\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n30\nSeptember 2025\nINTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE

Accounting policies\na) Basis of preparation\nThis interim financial report, which includes a condensed set of financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (\"the Group\"), has been prepared using the historical cost convention and based on International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") including IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' and IFRS 6 'Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Reserves', as adopted by the United Kingdom (\"UK\").\nThe condensed set of financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 is unaudited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared using accounting bases and policies consistent with those used in the preparation of the audited financial statements of the Company and the Group for the year ended 31 December 2024 and those to be used for the year ending 31 December 2025. The comparative figures for the half year ended 30 June 2024 are unaudited. The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2024 are not the Company's full statutory accounts but have been extracted from the audited financial which have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditors' report thereon was unqualified and did not contain a statement under sections 498(2) and 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThis half-yearly financial report was approved by the Board of Directors on 29 September 2025.\nb) Going concern\nThe Group will need to receive the requisite government approvals and to complete its agreed Cameroon farm-out with Prime Global Energies Limited and/or another asset-level transaction within the coming months, or otherwise raise further funds in addition to funds already raised in 2025, in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due, particularly with respect to the forthcoming drilling programme in Cameroon. The Directors are confident that the government approvals will be provided and that the agreed farm-out will be completed, but this is not yet certain.\nThe Group's assets in Namibia and South Africa are also pre-revenue, and therefore also depend on funds for further investment being available to the Group, whether from cash flow in Cameroon or other sources.\nTo bring the Cameroon assets to the point of sustainable cash flow generation will also require significant further investment.\nThe directors believe that there are a number of options available to fund these investments through any, or a combination, of production pre-financing or reserve-based lending, capital markets, further farm-outs or asset disposals. There can, however, be no guarantee that the required funds may be raised or transactions completed within the necessary timeframes, which results in an inherent material uncertainty as to the application of going concern in these accounts. Having assessed the risks attached to these uncertainties on a probabilistic basis, the Directors are confident that they can raise sufficient finance in a timely manner and therefore believe that the application of going concern is both appropriate and correct.\n2. Operating segments\nThe Group has two reportable operating segments: Africa and Head Office. Non-current assets and operating liabilities are located in Africa, whilst the majority of current assets are carried at Head Office. The Group has not yet commenced production and therefore has no revenue. Each reportable segment adopts the same accounting policies. In compliance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' the following table reconciles the operational loss and the assets and liabilities of each reportable segment with the consolidated figures presented in these Financial Statements, together with comparative figures for the period-ended 30 June 2024.\nAfrica\nHead Office\nTotal\nSix monthsended30 June 2025$\nSix monthsended30 June 2024$\nSix monthsended30 June 2025$\nSix monthsended30 June 2024$\nSix monthsended30 June 2025$\nSix monthsended30 June 2024$\n(Loss) / profit by reportable segment\n(330,848)\n542,095\n(885,533)\n(134,806)\n(1,216,381)\n407,289\nTotal assets by reportable segment\n1\n37,601,084\n35,253,064\n2,275,762\n932,825\n39,876,846\n36,185,889\nTotal liabilities by reportable segment\n2\n(1,036,286)\n(1,753,871)\n(2,254,945)\n(139,599)\n(3,291,231)\n(1,893,470)\n1\nCarrying amounts of segment assets exclude investments in subsidiaries.\n2\nCarrying amounts of segment liabilities exclude intra-group financing.\n3.

These payments totalled $195k (2024: $nil). For the same period in 2024, warrant charges totalling $183k were recognised within share-based payments.\nFarmout fees due to the broker on the signature of the farmout agreements totalled $150k (2024: $nil).

The material terms of the loan comprise a 5% cash implementation fee and interest of 15% per annum or pro rata until repaid, accrued daily and paid on the maturity date. The loan agreement states that as long as the Company's share price (as defined by the average of the 5 latest daily VWAPs) is below the fixed conversion price, then the Company has the right to prepay the loan with accrued interest to the date of repayment and no further fees, with 10 business-days' notice, in which case the conversion right immediately lapses on repayment. However, if the Company's share price is higher than the fixed conversion price, then it will be at the lender's discretion to accept an early cash redemption.\nOn 30 June 2025, the Company agreed to extend the fixed-price convertible loan of \u00a3500k by \u00a3250k to \u00a3750k with Prime Resources, with a duration of up to 12 months from the original drawdown.
