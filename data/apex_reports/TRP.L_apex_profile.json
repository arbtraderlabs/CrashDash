They confirmed our understanding, previously disclosed to investors, that the President supports our project, and the approvals will be processed when the new government is in place. Since that visit, we have been waiting for the new cabinet to be announced, so that the documents can be processed by the newly installed officials. In his New Year's speech, the President said the announcement would take place in \"days\n\", so we do expect it at any time.\n\"Since the holidays, we have also been contacted by the Namibian national oil company NAMCOR to confirm the resumption of their due diligence work and documentation for the additional farm-out agreement with Prime for our PEL96 licence.\n\"In the meantime, we have been working on financing options for the next phase of development for Njonji, as well as carrying out Namibian data acquisition, ensuring the elapsed time is directed in a productive manner, but since time is passing, when our broker offered us some further funds in response to investor demand, we felt it was prudent to accept them.\"\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nThis announcement does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase, or otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell, otherwise dispose of or issue, or any solicitation of any offer to sell, otherwise dispose of, issue, purchase, otherwise acquire or subscribe for, any security in the capital of the Company in any jurisdiction.\nThe information contained in this announcement is not to be released, published, distributed or transmitted by any means or media, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in or into the United States or to any US Person.

The period of the Broker Warrants will be three years at a strike price of 0.056p per share (representing a premium of 100% to the Subscription Price).\nShare Capital following the Subscription\nThe Subscription Shares will rank pari passu with the Company's existing shares. Application has been made for the Subscription Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM in two equal tranches of 982,142,857 shares each. It is expected that Admission of the Subscription Shares will become effective and that dealings will commence at 8.00 a.m. on or around 23 October 2025 in respect of the first tranche, and 31 October 2025 in respect of the second tranche.\nFollowing admission of both tranches of the]Subscription Shares, the Company's enlarged issued share capital will comprise\n31,279,995,707\nOrdinary Shares of 0.001p each with voting rights in the Company. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in the interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nWarrants and Options in Issue\nFollowing the issue of the Broker Warrants, the total number of warrants in issue is 1,616,942,411 equating to 4.5% of the Company's enlarged share capital assuming full exercise of all warrants, options and restricted shares.\nTower Resources Chairman & CEO, Jeremy Asher, commented:\n\"This is an exciting and very active period for us. Our understanding remains that documentation of our various approvals in Cameroon and Namibia is proceeding as previously disclosed. However,\nwe need to maintain readiness for drilling in Cameroon in Q1 2026, and we also need to keep our work programme on track in Namibia, where our entry to the First Renewal Period has already been approved. Therefore, we have decided that a small capital raise at this time will aid in supporting these goals and our overall schedule, pending the receipt of farm-out funds.\"\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\nThis announcement does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase, or otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell, otherwise dispose of or issue, or any solicitation of any offer to sell, otherwise dispose of, issue, purchase, otherwise acquire or subscribe for, any security in the capital of the Company in any jurisdiction.\nThe information contained in this announcement is not to be released, published, distributed or transmitted by any means or media, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in or into the United States or to any US Person.
