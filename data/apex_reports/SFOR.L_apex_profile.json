The Company expects like-for-like net revenue to be down circa 8.5%, with an operational EBITDA margin of circa 12%.\nNet debt will be both significantly below current consensus of \u00a3133 million and below the previously indicated range of \u00a3100-140 million, following a change in Treasury management and a consequent strong focus on working capital management resulting in an improvement in liquidity.\nThe net debt to operational EBITDA ratio at the end of 2025 is expected to be approximately 1.1x versus current consensus of 1.8x and well below the target of 1.5x.\nThe annual results for 2025 will be announced on 25 March 2026\nat which point the Company will provide more detailed targets for 2026.\nThe Company will recommend a 1p dividend, subject to the finalisation of the annual results and approval from the Board and Shareowners.\nSir Martin Sorrell, Executive Chairman of S\n4\nCapital plc said:\n\"Good to see both delivery beyond revised net revenue and operational EBITDA guidance and the significant improvement in liquidity. However, there is still much more to be done around net revenue and margin growth in 2026 and beyond which we will cover with the 2025 results presentation in March. The recommended 1p final dividend is an indication of the Board's confidence in continued improvement.\nIn an increasingly volatile world, clients continue to carefully assess where they should expand geographically and how they can apply new technologies such as AI, Blockchain and Quantum to increasing efficiency.\"\nEnquiries to:\nS4Capital plc\n+44 (0)20 3793 0003\nSir Martin Sorrell (Executive Chairman)\nAbout S\n4\nCapital\nOur strategy is to build a purely digital advertising and marketing services business for global, multinational, regional, and local clients, and millennial-driven influencer brands. We now have two synchronised practices: Marketing services and Technology services, along with an emphasis on 'faster, better, cheaper, more' execution in an always-on consumer-led environment, with a unitary structure.\nThe Company now has approximately 6,300 people in 33 countries with approximately 80% of net revenue across the Americas, 15% across Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 5% across Asia-Pacific.

Despite the cost actions we have already taken this year, this decline in net revenue will impact our operational EBITDA, which we are now targeting to be approximately \u00a375 million, below the current market consensus of \u00a381.6 million. This is mainly as a result of lower project-based revenue, continued client caution and a slower ramp up of our new business wins than expected.\nDespite this, our liquidity continues to improve more than anticipated and our targeted range for the year end net debt remains \u00a3100 million to \u00a3140 million.\nEnquiries:\nS4 Capital Tel: +44 (0)20 3793 0003\nSir Martin Sorrell (Executive Chairman)\nAbout S4 Capital\nOur strategy is to build a purely digital advertising and marketing services business for global, multinational, regional, and local clients, and millennial-driven influencer brands. This will be achieved by integrating leading businesses in two synchronised Practices: Marketing Services and Technology services, along with an emphasis on 'faster, better, cheaper, more' execution in an always-on consumer-led environment, with a unitary structure. The Company now has approximately 6,500 people in 33 countries with approximately 80% of net revenue across the Americas, 15% across Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 5% across Asia-Pacific. The longer-term objective is a geographic split of 60%:20%:20%. Marketing Services accounted for approximately 90% of net revenue, and Technology Services 10%. The longer term objective is a practice split of 75%:25%. Sir Martin was CEO of WPP for 33 years, building it from a \u00a31 million 'shell' company in 1985 into the world's largest advertising and marketing services company, with a market capitalisation of over \u00a316 billion on the day he left. Prior to that Sir Martin was Group Financial Director of Saatchi & Saatchi Company Plc for nine years.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
