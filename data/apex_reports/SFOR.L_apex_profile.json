Despite the cost actions we have already taken this year, this decline in net revenue will impact our operational EBITDA, which we are now targeting to be approximately \u00a375 million, below the current market consensus of \u00a381.6 million. This is mainly as a result of lower project-based revenue, continued client caution and a slower ramp up of our new business wins than expected.\nDespite this, our liquidity continues to improve more than anticipated and our targeted range for the year end net debt remains \u00a3100 million to \u00a3140 million.\nEnquiries:\nS4 Capital Tel: +44 (0)20 3793 0003\nSir Martin Sorrell (Executive Chairman)\nAbout S4 Capital\nOur strategy is to build a purely digital advertising and marketing services business for global, multinational, regional, and local clients, and millennial-driven influencer brands.

As a result, clients remain generally cautious given the uncertainty, with technology clients, which account for almost half our revenue, in particular, continuing to prioritise capital expenditure on expanding AI capacity. The hyperscalers are forecast to spend over half $1 trillion on expanding AI capacity. Our liquidity and cashflow continued to improve compared with the third quarter of 2024 and month-end average net debt was down almost 16% by \u00a329 million, from \u00a3180 million to \u00a3151 million, reflecting our focus on working capital and cost control. Third quarter month end average like-for-like net debt fell by \u00a343 million, from \u00a3197 million to \u00a3154 million, despite payment of the inaugural dividend.\nThe global macroeconomic environment has been challenging in 2025. Assessing the impact of US imposed tariffs was added to the three key risks around US/China relations, Russia/Ukraine and Iran/Middle-East. Clients, therefore, are likely to continue to remain cautious. However, once the levels of tariffs are negotiated and the impacts assessed, we believe clients will become much more selective about the geographies in which they operate in order to find growth and focus on implementing technologies, such as AI, Quantum computing and Blockchain, to drive efficiency in a slower growth, higher inflation and higher interest rate environment. This may be the time when AI-adoption accelerates at scale.\nWe are seeing significant opportunities for new business, particularly driven by our AI tools and capability. New business wins so far this year include new or broadened relationships with Asana, Amplifon, Samsung, Square, NCS, Opella, Visa, Cinemark and HelloFresh. We also continue to expand many of our existing relationships, in particular General Motors, Amazon, T-Mobile, PIF, and now two unannounced leading US-based Global FMCG Companies, which are ramping up significantly in the second half of the year.\nWe maintain our operational EBITDA and net debt guidance reflecting continued cost control and cash management. As in previous years, financial performance will be weighted to the fourth quarter. Liquidity is also forecast to improve, which will give us the ability to consider proposing an enhanced final dividend once the results for 2025 are announced, if targets are met.\"\nN\notes:\n1. Billings is gross billings to clients including pass through costs.\n2. Net revenue is revenue less direct costs.\n3. Like-for-like is a non-GAAP measure and relates to 2024 being restated to show the audited numbers for the previous year of the existing and acquired businesses consolidated for the same months as in 2025 applying currency rates as used in 2025.\n4. Pro-forma numbers relate to audited non-statutory and non-GAAP consolidated results in constant currency as if the Group had existed in full for the period and have been prepared under comparable GAAP with no consolidation eliminations in the pre-acquisition period.\n5. Operational EBITDA is operating profit or loss adjusted for acquisition related expenses, non-recurring items (primarily acquisition payments tied to continued employment, amortisation and impairment of business combination intangible assets and restructuring and other one-off expenses) and recurring items (share-based payments) and includes right-of-use assets depreciation. It is a non-GAAP measure management uses to assess the underlying business performance. Operational EBITDA margin is operational EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue.\n6. Adjusted figures are adjusted for non-recurring and recurring items as defined above.\n7. Net debt excludes lease liabilities.\n8. This is a target and not a profit forecast.\n9.\nComparative information for the prior period has been represented to reflect the Group's revised segment structure.\nThird Quarter Trading Update\nThe\nchallenging conditions\nwitnessed\nin the first half have continued in the third quarter.\nThird quarter\nreported billings were up 1.9%\n, up 5.1% like-for-like. R\neve\nnue was down 3.4%\nto\n\u00a3\n191.7\nmillion\n,\ndown 1.0%\nlike\n-for-like\n.\nNet revenue was down 6.9% on a reported basis to \u00a3167.0 million, down\n4.4% on a like-for-like basis.\nYear-to-date r\nevenue was down\n11.1\n% reported to\n\u00a3\n552.1\nmillion, down\n8.4\n% like-for-like\n.\nYear to date n\net revenue declined\n10.\n8\n% on a reported basis,\n8.2\n% like-for-like. Reported revenue and net revenue were both significantly impacted by FX, in particular the USD to GBP.\nThird quarter revenue and net revenue reflect ongoing client caution and timing of significant new business wins, however third quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), both on a reported basis and like-for-like reflect significant improvement primarily due to the cost restructuring programme implemented to mitigate revenue challenges and right-size the cost base to bring staff cost to net revenue ratios to the industry average of 65%. These actions have reduced the number of Monks to around 6,500, down 5% from circa 6,900 at June 2025 and down 13% from circa 7,500 at this time last year. This programme has been primarily focused on a range of non-billable roles across the business and further back-office efficiencies.\nPerformance by Practice\nMarketing Services practice revenue was down 1.6% in the third quarter to \u00a3175.5 million, with like-for-like up 0.7%. The quarter's performance was below expectations. This reflected ongoing client caution and lower activity, particularly with some of our larger technology clients. Reported third quarter net revenue was down 5.3% to \u00a3150.8 million and 2.8% like-for-like. Year-to-date the Marketing Services practice reported revenue was down 8.7% to \u00a3506.6 million and 5.9% like-for-like. Marketing Services reported net revenue was down 8.1% to \u00a3449.8 million and 5.2% like-for-like.\nTechnology Services practice third quarter reported revenue was down 19.4%, or 16.5% like-for-like, to \u00a316.2 million. Third quarter reported net revenue was down 19.4% to \u00a316.2 million, down 16.5% like-for-like, impacted by client negotiation delays as well as longer sales cycles for new business reflecting the challenging ongoing macroeconomic conditions. Year-to-date Technology Services reported revenue was down 31.3% to \u00a345.5 million, like-for-like down 29.3%. Reported net revenue was down 31.4% to \u00a345.4 million, with like-for-like down 29.6%, impacted by client negotiation delays and the anticipated lower business from one key client.\nPerformance by geography\nThe Americas, our largest region accounting for over 80% of net revenue was slightly up, like-for-like, in the third quarter with reported net revenue down 1.7% to \u00a3136.1 million and up 1.6% like-for-like, and with stronger growth in Latin America. Year-to-date, the Americas reported net revenue was down 8.8% to \u00a3394.3 million and 5.6% like-for-like. Europe, the Middle East and Africa was down 25.7% in the third quarter to \u00a322.6 million and 26.6% like-for-like. Year-to-date reported net revenue was down 17.4% to \u00a374.4 million and like-for-like down 17.3%. Asia-Pacific, our smallest region also saw lower activity, with reported net revenue down 20.2% to \u00a38.3 million in the third quarter and 16.2% like-for-like. Year-to-date reported net revenue declined 19.2% to \u00a326.5 million and like-for-like was down 15.3%.\nBalance Sheet\nNet debt ended the third quarter at \u00a3151.1 million, or 1.8x net debt/12 month proforma operational EBITDA. Compared to half year end net debt of \u00a3145.9 million, net debt increased \u00a35.2 million, reflecting additional cash outflows from the Group's inaugural dividend, restructuring costs and continuing FX headwinds. The trailing 12 months proforma operational EBITDA was \u00a383.4 million. The balance sheet has sufficient liquidity and long-dated debt maturities to facilitate growth with our key covenant being net debt not to exceed 4.5x the 12 month proforma operational EBITDA. Our Term Loan B matures in August 2028 and our undrawn revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") in August 2026, with the \u00a380 million RCF facility having been extended to February 2028.\nNew business and AI\nContinuing the trends seen during the first half of the year, we are seeing our AI initiatives improve visualisation and copywriting productivity, deliver considerably more effective and economic hyper-personalisation, delivering more automated and integrated media planning and buying, improving general client and agency efficiency and democratise knowledge. We are now producing high quality commercials using AI technologies such as Runway, Luma, Flux, Omniverse (Nvidia), Substance (Adobe) and Unreal that take hours and days to produce at significantly lower cost rather than traditional production techniques, which take weeks and months at significantly greater cost. The quality continues to improve in real time and clients that are exposed to the results of these AI technologies are very excited about their implementation and the commercial impact on their marketing budgets and return on investment. As a result, we are changing our revenue model from a purely, time-based approach to one more based on outputs - i.e. use of assets.\nWe are seeing significant opportunities for new business, particularly driven by our AI tools and capability. New business wins so far this year include new or broadened relationships with Asana, Amplifon, Samsung, Square, NCS, Opella, Visa, Cinemark and HelloFresh. We also continue to expand many of our existing relationships, in particular General Motors and Amazon, which is ramping up significantly in the second half of the year. In April, we won a large \"Real Time Brands\" assignment with our existing client T-Mobile. In July we were engaged by a leading US-based Global FMCG, as their Content Studio Agency Partner, which draws on both our \"Real Time Brands\" and \"Orchestration Partner\" propositions with a focus on quality creative combined with dimension and cultural relevancy, beyond simply making assets at scale. These new wins are contributing to our second-half performance and over time are expected to be significant relationships for us. In October, another existing US-based Global FMCG client appointed us to help implement AI throughout its marketing supply chain, a partnership based on a new subscription-based model focussing on outputs and outcomes. We continue to win multiple exploratory assignments and AI film projects, as clients experiment and explore AI applications and develop AI use cases. AI capability is becoming more central to the agency's way of working and new business efforts. In this regard the Company's early adoption of AI and proactive approach to staff training on AI is beginning to pay off.\u00a0We have won four major AI industry awards in the last two years.\nOur new Go-To-Market propositions, Orchestration Partner, Real Time Brands, Glass Box Media and Digital Transformation are all starting to resonate strongly with clients. These are built around hyper-personalisation at scale, social media, brand strategy, transparent media buying and planning and the leveraging of technology.\nESG\nWe remain committed to the pillars of our ESG strategy: people fulfilment, our responsibility to the world and one brand. We continue to focus on improving our external reporting, our reporting tools and governance to help us move towards increased transparency and effective reporting and to comply with future global regulatory requirements. We continue to enjoy and maintain our B Corp status and we have significantly improved our Ecovadis score. The B Corp status recognises our achievements in governance and accountability, environmental performance, social impact and DE&I, that we are accountable to all stakeholders, not just shareowners and that we are transparent in our reporting.\nSummary and outlook\nFor the Company as a whole, despite the wider market uncertainty and significant volatility in global economic policy, particularly as a result of the US-imposed tariffs, we expect that full year like-for-like net revenue will be down by upper single digits. Despite this, we continue to target le-for-like operational EBITDA8 to be broadly similar to 2024. We will continue to focus on our cost base and have taken further action to support profitability. Our targeted range for the year end net debt remains \u00a3100 million to \u00a3140 million, despite restructuring cost payments and the continuing FX headwinds witnessed so far this year. We target medium term financial leverage at the lower end of our previous range of around 1.5 times operational EBITDA. Over the longer term we continue to target growth to outperform our markets and operational EBITDA margins to return to historic levels of around 20%8, with a staff cost to net revenue ratio of 65%.\nThe strategy of S4Capital remains the same. The Company's unitary, purely digital transformation model, based on first-party data fuelling the creation, production and distribution of digital advertising content, distributed by digital media and built on technology platforms to ensure success and efficiency, resonates with clients.\nWe continue to streamline and integrate our businesses, we have rebranded to Monks and are focusing all our current capabilities into two Practices: Marketing Services and Technology Services. Our tagline 'faster, better, cheaper and more' or 'speed, quality, value and more' and a unitary structure both appeal strongly, even more so in challenging economic times.\nResults webcast and conference call\nA webcast and conference call covering the results will be held today at 09:00 GMT.
