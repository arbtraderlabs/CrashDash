The Half-Year has been one of sustained progress as we advanced the Taprobane Minerals Project through a series of important technical, commercial, and operational milestones.\nThe Company's drilling programme has continued to demonstrate exceptional grades and expanding mineralisation, culminating in a major upgrade, as announced on 17 November 2025, to the Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") for the Initial Mining Area (\"IMA\"). This has reinforced the Project's scale and extended its longevity.\nIn parallel, we have advanced engineering, design, and regulatory work required for development, improved Project economics, and strengthened our position in Sri Lanka as we move towards construction.\nA strategic investment secured in the period from one of Sri Lanka's\nleading diversified conglomerates, together with investment support from existing shareholders, ensures the Company is adequately funded through and beyond FID.\nReview of Activity\nDrilling & MRE Upgrade\nThe Company was actively drilling during the Half-Year, completing Phase 1 Aircore drilling at depth in June 2025 with 170 reverse circulation holes drilled for 1,501 metres, in the proposed IMA. This resulted in a new discovery with confirmation of high-grade mineralisation at depth and outside the pre-existing MRE.\nAssays were returned from the laboratory from July through September 2025, confirming consistently high heavy mineral grades and a more than threefold increase in the surface area of the mineralisation in the IMA alone compared to the pre-existing resource. This marked a step change for the Project as the Company advances towards development. The discovery of multiple high-grade palaeo-shorelines at depth further strengthens the long-term potential of the Project.\nWhereas the 2016 MRE in the IMA covered 47 hectares, the aircore drilling assay results from the 2025 programme indicate the mineralisation extends substantially to the west and at depth and now extends across an area around 3.2 times larger at 152 hectares. Analysis of this work led to the announcement on 17 November 2025 of a major upgrade, with Stage 1 drilling delivering nearly a 15 times increase in MRE tonnes in the proposed IMA (using a bottom cut of 2% Heavy Minerals (\"HM\")).\nMaintaining a 5% HM bottom cut delivers a 4.8 times increase in MRE tonnes in the IMA, from 897kt to 4.3Mt at an average resource grade of 10.5% HM. Applying a 2% HM bottom cut, however, delivers a 14.6 times increase in MRE tonnes from 897kt to 13.1Mt at an average resource grade of 5.5% HM.\nThe mineralisation typically commences from surface to a maximum of 15 metres depth with an average total depth of 7.9 metres. The MRE is predominately classified at an indicated level, which is suitable for calculation of Probable Mining Reserves for operational planning and product scheduling purposes.\nThis is a considerable resource increase, which exponentially exceeds the Company's assumed upgrade for the Initial Mining Area when the Company updated the Project's financial model and NPV, as announced on 18 September 2025. The Company now looks forward to continuing the deeper drilling across the balance of the Project where hopefully this trend will continue to deliver similar multiples of resource increase. The implications of a similar increase across the whole resource make this a potentially multi-generational project.\nOngoing technical evaluations are required to determine the optimal pit sizes and processing strategy, but it is clear that this will open up flexible mining options, including a combination of high-grade surface mining and significantly lower cost dredging for the deeper and wider deposits, subject to local approvals.\nThese results clearly justify the ongoing drilling programme, which is expected to significantly increase the total Project resource and to facilitate a better understanding of the Company's mining and processing alternatives, which will add to our overall valuation for what will clearly be a long life mine with a grade that is expected to remain among the highest in the world.\nProgress Towards Project Development\nThe Company intends to be cash flow generative by early 2027. This requires all studies to be complete and Project approvals and funding in place in order to commence construction in Q1 2026 - with FID being taken any time prior. Key areas of progress include:\n- Technical\n\u00b7\nCompletion of Process Flow Diagram for the Wet Concentrator Plant (\"WCP\")\n\u00b7\nEstablishment of WCP process design criteria for low (150 tph), base (175 tph) and high (200 tph) throughput scenarios to accommodate variable feed grades as mining progresses\n\u00b7\nCompletion of 3D model and general arrangement drawings for WCP\n\u00b7\nCompletion of mechanical equipment list and electrical load demand for WCP\n\u00b7\nCompletion of logistics study for road haulage and export (via Colombo Port)\n\u00b7\nCompletion of hydrogeology study\n\u00b7\nAssessment of heavy mobile equipment requirements\nMineral Technologies has provided a fixed lump sum price for the fabrication and supply of key Stage 1 equipment, including the pre-designed Flex-Series WCP, feed hopper and screening unit. The flowsheet remains a simple three-stage spiral plant with a feed hopper, vibrating screen, and ancillary equipment.\n- Advancing Two Main Approvals\nThe Company continues to await parliamentary endorsement of a new National Minerals Policy, understood to be imminent. We expect its publication will send a strong signal that Sri Lanka is 'Open for Business' for mining. Certainly, we have been encouraged by recent moves in Sri Lanka to transfer the management of the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Industry, with associated positive public statements indicative of a progressive attitude to the sector from the Minister of Industry. Subsequent to the announcement of the National Minerals Policy, guidelines on the specific value addition requirements in the mineral sands sector are anticipated, and we have been very active in seeking to educate all stakeholders on a practical staged approach. Capital Metals is also seeking an additional Industrial Mining Licence (\"IML\") focussed on the proposed IMA and adjacent to the two existing approved IMLs.\n- Funding Plans\nDiscussions with banks and other investors to provide project debt and equity financing began in the Half-Year and are ongoing. The Company is also engaged in active discussions with preferred potential offtakers, with a focus on those that may also provide project equity or working capital funding.\nSeveral constructive meetings were held last month at the key global mineral sands conference in Kuala Lumpur. The recognised high quality of the Project's mineral products has attracted broad market interest, and counterparties have expressed positive interest in long-term supply arrangements.\n- Building Trust Through Action in Local Communities\nAmong the most important areas of progress in the Half-Year has been the strengthening of relationships with host communities in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province. Recent initiatives include sponsorship of local schools and A-Level education programmes, spiritual events, fishing societies, sporting associations, as well as the installation of community suggestion boxes to encourage open dialogue and support for environmental activities such as coastal beach clean-ups.\nDuring the period, Capital Metals, in association with the Urani Super Warriors Sports Club, sponsored a local cricket tournament branded the \"Capital Metals Cricket Cup\", with over 40 teams from around the eastern province coming together in an incredible display of talent and sportsmanship. The Company's Non-Executive Director and a Sri Lankan cricket hero, Aravinda De Silva, presented awards during the closing ceremony.\nAs part of the board's site visit, members donated a fishing boat to a local fishing society, a gesture that will directly benefit more than 50 families. The Company has also helped women's groups and small-scale agricultural projects to support local livelihoods. These activities reflect the Company's commitment to delivering sustainable, long-term benefits for local stakeholders alongside the advancement of the Taprobane Minerals Project.\nMineral sands mining is not well known in the Project area. This presents challenges in terms of awareness and understanding of the Company's proposed activities. The Company has been actively and successfully prioritising education and awareness programmes, both locally within the Project area and more broadly across the country, recognising that education is key to building long-term understanding and support. The Company's Sri Lankan Facebook account, launched during the Half-Year, has quickly amassed over a thousand followers and is a key channel for communication.\nThe Company is also in the process of establishing the first of a series of Coastal Regeneration Centres, focussed on the preferred native plants and regeneration practices required for rehabilitation over the life of the Project, while also providing a platform for students and the wider public to learn more about the Company's environmental practices.\n- In-Country Team Expansion and Capacity Building\nKey local appointments during the Half-Year include a Financial Controller, Mining Engineer, Project Manager and Processing Specialist, with recruitment ongoing for a Manager of Environment to lead the development of the operational Environmental Management Plan and detailed rehabilitation plans in coordination with the mine engineering team.\nThe team is also developing a heavy equipment training programme to upskill local employees and build long-term operational capacity.\n- Updated Financial Model and Increase in NPV\nA key piece of work in the Half-Year was the development of a new financial model including:\n\u00b7\nReduced Stage 1 capex of $20.9 million, as announced on 18 September 2025\n\u00b7\nRefinement of heavy equipment requirements using a first-principles approach\n\u00b7\nDetailed build-up of mining and processing operating costs\n\u00b7\nUpdated logistics costs following completion of logistics studies\n\u00b7\nResource increase to reflect indications from recent drilling results, with base and upside case resources modelled at 1.33x and 1.67x the existing MRE respectively\n\u00b7\nUpdated increased corporate tax and royalty assumptions\nThis resulted in materially improved Project economics, with the MRE upgrade assumptions being subsequently exceeded when the MRE for the IMA was published after the Half-Year end on 18 September 2025.\n\u00b7\nthe base case NPV8 (post tax) has increased to $180 million compared to $155 million;\n\u00b7\nthe upside case NPV8 (post tax) has increased to $289 million compared to $235 million;\n\u00b7\nthe base case IRR (post tax) has increased to 73% compared to 56%;\n\u00b7\nthe upside case IRR (post tax) has increased to 98% compared to 73%; and\n\u00b7\nthe updated NPV8 per share of 27p and 44p for base and upside cases, respectively.\n- Premium Garnet Quality Confirmed by Independent Testing\nThe results of a garnet product quality study announced in the Half-Year confirmed that the garnet is of a superior quality than previously thought and will therefore attract a higher price in the industrial abrasive market. The Company is in discussions with global garnet distributors regarding potential offtake agreements.\nFinancial Matters\nOn 29 May 2025, the Company announced a landmark strategic investment of $2 million into the Company by way of a share subscription by Ambeon Capital, together with an option for Ambeon Capital or its nominees to invest up to a further $2 million. By September 2025, the option was fully exercised by Ambeon Capital's nominees, bringing in $4 million in total from this strategic investment. This was supplemented by approximately a further $1 million from existing shareholder participation. These funding events are expected to see the Company comfortably funded through FID and beyond.\nAmbeon Capital is a Colombo Stock Exchange listed diversified conglomerate and part of one of Sri Lanka's most successful investment organisations. Ambeon Capital had been looking to enter Sri Lanka's mineral sands sector and has now become the Company's largest shareholder, owning c.12.15% of the Company. Given its connections in Sri Lanka, Ambeon Capital is already assisting in improving the speed and flow of information and communication with national stakeholders.\nAmbeon Capital and Capital Metals also signed a non-binding MoU for an agreed path to fund the Project at FID to commence construction, through arranging the provision of $20 million in equity/debt at the Project level, with such amount anticipated to be sufficient to complete Stage 1 development at which point the Project is expected to become self-funding.\nThe Company made a loss before income tax for the Half-Year of $1,069,078 compared to $446,781 in the corresponding period last year. The loss for the year increased primarily due to the significant accounting charge from the issuance of Silver Pine Pacific Limited share options in September 2025, together with higher expenses driven by increased Company activity levels, such as travel expenses and equity fundraising initiatives. These activities include the continuation of the drilling programme, advanced engineering, design and regulatory work for development, and strengthened presence in Sri Lanka ahead of construction. As at 30 September 2025, the Company had $4,781,609 in cash and cash equivalents (31 March 2025: $1,351,494).\nBoard Appointments\nIn August 2025, I had the honour to welcome two respected Sri Lankan business leaders to the Board of Capital Metals, Aravinda De Silva and Savanth Sebastian.\nAravinda De Silva is an ICC Cricket Hall of Fame inductee and national sporting icon who played a crucial part in Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup-winning team. He is making a significant positive impact in Sri Lanka as a businessman and investor, and he is already playing a key role in the development of the Taprobane Minerals Project.\nSavanth Sebastian is a leading business figure in Sri Lanka with considerable industry knowledge and expertise. He currently serves as a Director of Ambeon Capital, helping to shape its financial and investment strategies. He was a Director at Nations Trust Bank PLC of Sri Lanka and serves on the board of Sri Lanka's largest IT company.\nAravinda and Savanth played key roles in cementing Ambeon Capital's strategic investment in Capital Metals. The Company is working hard with Aravinda, Savanth and the Ambeon Capital team, with whom the Company now shares an office in Colombo, on many fronts to develop the Project that will create sustainable value for Sri Lanka in the form of jobs, skills, revenue, education, and training.\nOutlook\nThe Half-Year has been marked by substantial progress across all aspects of the Taprobane Minerals Project. From the exceptional results of the Phase 1 Aircore drilling programme at depth and the subsequent Mineral Resource Estimate upgrade to the advancement of engineering, regulatory, and commercial workstreams, the Company has continued to improve the foundations for Project development. Strategic investments from Ambeon Capital, alongside support from existing shareholders, have ensured the Company is well funded to complete the approvals and planning required to commence construction.\nThe Company now looks forward to continuing the deeper Aircore drilling across the balance of the Project where hopefully the trend seen in Phase 1 will continue to deliver similar multiples of resource increases. The implications of a similar increase across the whole resource make this a potentially multi-generational project. There remains a lot of work to do to determine the optimal pit sizes and how the resource will be processed, but it is clear that this will open up flexible mining options, including a combination of high-grade surface mining and significantly lower cost dredging for the deeper and wider deposits, subject to local approvals.\nWith a strengthened Board, including prominent Sri Lankans, growing local engagement, and an expanding social licence to operate, Capital Metals is firmly positioned to deliver a long-life, high-grade mineral sands operation that will create meaningful value for shareholders, local communities, and Sri Lanka. On behalf of the Board, I extend my sincere thanks to our employees, advisers, partners, and other stakeholders for their ongoing support in advancing this world-class asset.\nGreg Martyr\nExecutive Chairman\n18 December 2025\nCAPITAL METALS PLC -

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE 6 MONTH PERIOD ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n1.\nGeneral information\nCapital Metals plc is a mineral exploration company with its shares admitted to trading on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated and registered in England and Wales, with registration number 05555087. The address of its registered office is Eccleston Yards, 25 Eccleston Place, London SW1W 9NF, United Kingdom.\n2. Accounting Policies\nIAS 8 requires that management shall use its judgement in developing and applying accounting policies that result in information which is relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users, that are reliable, free from bias, prudent, complete and represent faithfully the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity.\n2.1 Basis of Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the AIM Rules for Companies. As permitted, the Company has chosen not to adopt IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Statements\" in preparing this interim financial information. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, which have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards.\nThe interim financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006. It has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK adopted international accounting standards.\nStatutory financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 17 August 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified in relation to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed interim financial statements are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the Company's auditor.\n2.2 Accounting Policies\nExcept as described below, the same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation have been followed in these condensed interim financial statements as were applied in the preparation of the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nChanges in accounting policy and disclosures\n(a)\nNew and amended standards adopted by the Group and Company\nA number of new and amended standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have become effective for the first time for financial periods beginning on (or after) 1 April 2024 and have been applied by the Company and Group in these interim financial statements. None of these new and amended standards and interpretations had a significant effect on the Company or Group because they are either not relevant to the Company or Group's activities or require accounting which is consistent with the Company or Group's current accounting policies.\n(b) New standards, amendments and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective or not yet endorsed and not early adopted\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods, and which have not been adopted early.\n2.3 Going concern\nThese financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Given the Group's current cash position and its demonstrated ability to raise capital, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting preparing the condensed unaudited interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025.\nSince 31 March 2025, the Group has sourced additional financing validating the Directors decision to adopt the Going Concern assumption. The Directors continue to exercise due process when evaluating the liquidity of the Group and will continue to make certain assumptions with regards to the timing and amount of future expenditure over which they have control. Considering all the factors affecting the Group the Directors are confident in the ability of the Group to satisfy this condition and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these interim financial statements.\n2.4 Risks and uncertainties\nThe Board continuously assesses and monitors the key risks of the business. The key risks that could affect the Company's medium term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the 2025 Annual Report, a copy of which is available on the Company's website: www.capitalmetals.com. The key financial risks are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk and fair value estimation.\n3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of condensed interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in the 31 March 2025 Annual Report. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period.\n4. Dividends\nNo dividend has been declared or paid by the Company during the six months ended 30 September 2025 (2024: $nil).\n5. Earnings per Share\nThe calculation for basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share is based on the total comprehensive loss after income tax attributable to equity shareholders for the period and is as follows:\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nPeriod ended30 Sep2025\nPeriod ended30 Sep2024\nYear ended31 March2025\nNet profit / (loss) for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders for continuing operations ($)\n(1,069,078)\n(446,781)\n(1,140,932)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue\n770,730,376\n701,083,711\n701,083,711\nBasic and diluted earnings per share for continuing operations (pence)\n(0.139)\n(0.064)\n(0.163)\nThere is no difference between the diluted loss per share and the basic loss per share presented. Share options and warrants could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive for the period presented.\n6.\nIntangible fixed assets\nThe movement in capitalised exploration and evaluation costs during the period was as follows:\nExploration & Evaluation at Cost and Net Book Value\n$\nOpening balance - 30 September 2024\n5,708,492\nAdditions\n308,719\nForeign Exchange\n38,080\nAs at 31 March 2025\n6,055,291\nOpening balance - 1 April 2025\n6,055,291\nAdditions\n663,729\nForeign Exchange\n(33,598)\nAs at 30 September 2025\n6,685,422\n7.

The Company extends its sincere thoughts to all those affected by this extreme weather event.\nCyclone Ditwah is considered an extremely rare meteorological event for Sri Lanka, with cyclonic systems of this intensity seldom forming so close to the island. Publicly reported data indicates that multiple districts were impacted by flooding, wind damage and temporary displacement of communities, with rainfall totals in some areas recorded at several multiples of seasonal averages and widespread power outages reported nationally.\nThe Company confirms that all Capital Metals' staff are safe. Personnel in the Eastern Province experienced a loss of grid power for approximately one week, however, power has now been restored to the region. Normal food and fuel supplies are also resuming following temporary disruption.\nThere has been no impact to the Company's Taprobane Minerals Project area or assets, and the Company does not foresee any material impact to its development plans, however, the government is clearly very focussed on the recovery efforts which are going to take some time. Capital Metals will be assisting with ongoing focussed local area crisis related support efforts.\nAs a reminder to shareholders, the Taprobane Minerals Project processing plant is being designed with its own off-grid power supply, reducing vulnerability to extreme weather events and mitigating the risk of disruption from any loss of grid power.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / Christopher Raggett / David Asquith\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Adviser)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET). We are developing the Taprobane Minerals Project in Sri Lanka, approximately 220km east of Colombo, containing industrial minerals including ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and garnet. The Project is one of the highest-grade mineral sands projects globally, with potential for further grade and resource expansion. In 2022, a third-party Preliminary Economic Assessment provided a Project NPV of US$155-235m based on existing resources, with further identified optimisation potential. We are committed to applying modern mining practices and bringing significant positive benefits to Sri Lanka and the local community. We expect over 300 direct new jobs to be created and over US$150m in direct government royalties and taxes to be paid.\nVisit our website:\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nFollow us on social media:\nX:\n@MetalsCapital\nLinkedIn:\n@Capital Metals plc\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The resultant economic HM% bottom cut from operational financial input will allow a re-reporting of the MRE should it be required. Both 2% HM and 5% HM model comparisons are presented with further drilling and optimisation work required to determine the most favourable cutoff.\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"This is a massive resource increase which exponentially exceeds our assumed upgrade for the Initial Mining Area when we updated the Project's financial model and NPV on 18 September 2025. We now look forward to continuing the deeper drilling across the balance of the Project where hopefully this trend will continue to deliver similar multiples of resource increase. The implications of a similar increase across the whole resource makes this a potentially multi-generational project.\nThere remains a lot of work to do to determine the optimal pit sizes and how the resource will be processed, but it is clear that this will open up flexible mining options, including a combination of high-grade surface mining and significantly lower cost dredging for the deeper and wider deposits, subject to local approvals.\nThese results clearly justify the ongoing drilling programme, which is expected to significantly increase the total Project resource and allow us to better understand our mining and processing alternatives, which will add to our overall valuation for what will clearly be a long life mine with a grade that is expected to remain among the highest in the world. In the meantime, we are going full steam ahead on the existing plans to start construction of the plant to get into cash flow by early 2027.\n\"\nNext steps\nExploration and resource development will continue subject to ongoing approvals to extend the current drill pattern southward through the remainder of EL168 and into the EL199 area. EL199 is similarly endowed with substantial resource addition potential to the west and at depth.\nTable 1. Comparison of Proposed IMA 2016 & 2025 MRE @ 2% and 5% HM bottom cut\nFigure 1. Proposed IMA MRE coloured by HM% and showing drill locations (V.E. = 1:7) Drill sections shown.\nFigure 2. Drilling and model cross section 1 at 508750mN showing drilled and modelled HM%. (V.E. = 1:7)\nFigure 3. Drilling and model cross section 2 at 509150mN showing drilled and modelled HM%. (V.E. = 1:7)\nFigure 4. Drilling and model cross section 3 at 509550mN showing drilled and modelled HM%. (V.E. = 1:7)\nSubsequent to an extensive QA/QC verification, validated drill hole and assay data tables were imported into Datamine Studio RM mining software and de-surveyed, using the Holes3D super-process, to produce a Datamine drill hole file in SLD99 UTM grid coordinates.\nDrill hole collar elevations were then projected vertically to the DTM topographic surface. The drill hole file was zoned according to the geological interpretation wireframes in the same order of addition as applied to the model construction.\nThe strike length of the Mineral Resource is currently 2.4 kilometres. The dimensions of the Mineral Resource are expressed in plan by the model boundary, which is limited by the extent of drilling or until the government land property boundary is reached. Currently it extends up to 1.3km in width and has an average depth of 7.9m. Mineralisation remains open to the north and south.\nThe bulk density applied to the MRE has been generated for each discrete geological domain. A component-based density algorithm, designed by Placer Consulting, combines density characteristics from each textural and compositional component of the sample, including the grade and heavy mineral species present. This is then combined with laboratory-generated porosity data and a sample-by-sample density value is created and applied to the resource model cells.\nDatamine Studio RM was utilised in the computerised estimation of the resource. Interpolation of the resource drill hole data into the block model occurs using an orientated elliptical search volume defined by the trend of the geological unit or HM grade distribution. The interpolation is anisotropic and occurs discretely within each zone (hard boundary) according to the ZONE key field in both the model and drill hole file.\nA discretisation array of 3 x 3 x 2 is employed for interpolation averaging into each cell. All cells/sub-cells are interpolated individually. The Inverse Distance Power method (to the power of three) is used for the interpolation of all lithology and analysis data in all modelled zones. Three search volumes are utilised to populate model cells with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 30 samples allowable in any search population.\nModel cells are populated by the search volume applied (EST=1, EST=2 & EST=3) to assist in defining mineral resource confidence levels. Those areas populated by the first search are allocated an Indicated status. A multiplication of the search volume by a factor of 3 and 5 was used for the second and third search, respectively.\nThe designation of resource category was simplified by the application of new drilling and analysis at a regular sample interval. The quality of informing drill, assay and mineralogy data, Lidar survey, the performance of QA/QC samples and the demonstrable geological and grade continuity also assisted in the classification of this resource.\nThe MRE was completed by the Company's Competent Person, Richard Stockwell in accordance with the reporting guidelines of the 2012 JORC Code. The resource comparison is detailed in Table 1 and the resource is presented in Figures 1 - 4.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / Christopher Raggett / David Asquith\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Adviser)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).
