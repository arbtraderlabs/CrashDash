We are developing the Taprobane Minerals Project in Sri Lanka, approximately 220km east of Colombo, containing industrial minerals including ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and garnet. The Project is one of the highest-grade mineral sands projects globally, with potential for further grade and resource expansion. In 2022, a third-party Preliminary Economic Assessment provided a Project NPV of US$155-235m based on existing resources, with further identified optimisation potential. We are committed to applying modern mining practices and bringing significant positive benefits to Sri Lanka and the local community. We expect over 300 direct new jobs to be created and over US$150m in direct government royalties and taxes to be paid.\nVisit our website:\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nFollow us on social media:\nX:\n@MetalsCapital\nLinkedIn:\n@Capital Metals plc\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

We are developing the Taprobane Minerals Project in Sri Lanka, approximately 220km east of Colombo, containing industrial minerals including ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and garnet. The Project is one of the highest-grade mineral sands projects globally, with potential for further grade and resource expansion. In 2022, a third-party Preliminary Economic Assessment provided a Project NPV of US$155-235m based on existing resources, with further identified optimisation potential. We are committed to applying modern mining practices and bringing significant positive benefits to Sri Lanka and the local community. We expect over 300 direct new jobs to be created and over US$150m in direct government royalties and taxes to be paid.\nVisit our website:\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nFollow us on social media:\nX:\n@MetalsCapital\nLinkedIn:\n@Capital Metals plc\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nIntroduction\nI am pleased to present the unaudited half year report for the six-month period ended 30 September 2025. The Half-Year has been one of sustained progress as we advanced the Taprobane Minerals Project through a series of important technical, commercial, and operational milestones.\nThe Company's drilling programme has continued to demonstrate exceptional grades and expanding mineralisation, culminating in a major upgrade, as announced on 17 November 2025, to the Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") for the Initial Mining Area (\"IMA\"). This has reinforced the Project's scale and extended its longevity.\nIn parallel, we have advanced engineering, design, and regulatory work required for development, improved Project economics, and strengthened our position in Sri Lanka as we move towards construction.\nA strategic investment secured in the period from one of Sri Lanka's\nleading diversified conglomerates, together with investment support from existing shareholders, ensures the Company is adequately funded through and beyond FID.\nReview of Activity\nDrilling & MRE Upgrade\nThe Company was actively drilling during the Half-Year, completing Phase 1 Aircore drilling at depth in June 2025 with 170 reverse circulation holes drilled for 1,501 metres, in the proposed IMA. This resulted in a new discovery with confirmation of high-grade mineralisation at depth and outside the pre-existing MRE.\nAssays were returned from the laboratory from July through September 2025, confirming consistently high heavy mineral grades and a more than threefold increase in the surface area of the mineralisation in the IMA alone compared to the pre-existing resource. This marked a step change for the Project as the Company advances towards development. The discovery of multiple high-grade palaeo-shorelines at depth further strengthens the long-term potential of the Project.\nWhereas the 2016 MRE in the IMA covered 47 hectares, the aircore drilling assay results from the 2025 programme indicate the mineralisation extends substantially to the west and at depth and now extends across an area around 3.2 times larger at 152 hectares. Analysis of this work led to the announcement on 17 November 2025 of a major upgrade, with Stage 1 drilling delivering nearly a 15 times increase in MRE tonnes in the proposed IMA (using a bottom cut of 2% Heavy Minerals (\"HM\")).\nMaintaining a 5% HM bottom cut delivers a 4.8 times increase in MRE tonnes in the IMA, from 897kt to 4.3Mt at an average resource grade of 10.5% HM. Applying a 2% HM bottom cut, however, delivers a 14.6 times increase in MRE tonnes from 897kt to 13.1Mt at an average resource grade of 5.5% HM.\nThe mineralisation typically commences from surface to a maximum of 15 metres depth with an average total depth of 7.9 metres. The MRE is predominately classified at an indicated level, which is suitable for calculation of Probable Mining Reserves for operational planning and product scheduling purposes.\nThis is a considerable resource increase, which exponentially exceeds the Company's assumed upgrade for the Initial Mining Area when the Company updated the Project's financial model and NPV, as announced on 18 September 2025. The Company now looks forward to continuing the deeper drilling across the balance of the Project where hopefully this trend will continue to deliver similar multiples of resource increase. The implications of a similar increase across the whole resource make this a potentially multi-generational project.\nOngoing technical evaluations are required to determine the optimal pit sizes and processing strategy, but it is clear that this will open up flexible mining options, including a combination of high-grade surface mining and significantly lower cost dredging for the deeper and wider deposits, subject to local approvals.\nThese results clearly justify the ongoing drilling programme, which is expected to significantly increase the total Project resource and to facilitate a better understanding of the Company's mining and processing alternatives, which will add to our overall valuation for what will clearly be a long life mine with a grade that is expected to remain among the highest in the world.\nProgress Towards Project Development\nThe Company intends to be cash flow generative by early 2027. This requires all studies to be complete and Project approvals and funding in place in order to commence construction in Q1 2026 - with FID being taken any time prior. Key areas of progress include:\n- Technical\n\u00b7\nCompletion of Process Flow Diagram for the Wet Concentrator Plant (\"WCP\")\n\u00b7\nEstablishment of WCP process design criteria for low (150 tph), base (175 tph) and high (200 tph) throughput scenarios to accommodate variable feed grades as mining progresses\n\u00b7\nCompletion of 3D model and general arrangement drawings for WCP\n\u00b7\nCompletion of mechanical equipment list and electrical load demand for WCP\n\u00b7\nCompletion of logistics study for road haulage and export (via Colombo Port)\n\u00b7\nCompletion of hydrogeology study\n\u00b7\nAssessment of heavy mobile equipment requirements\nMineral Technologies has provided a fixed lump sum price for the fabrication and supply of key Stage 1 equipment, including the pre-designed Flex-Series WCP, feed hopper and screening unit. The flowsheet remains a simple three-stage spiral plant with a feed hopper, vibrating screen, and ancillary equipment.\n- Advancing Two Main Approvals\nThe Company continues to await parliamentary endorsement of a new National Minerals Policy, understood to be imminent. We expect its publication will send a strong signal that Sri Lanka is 'Open for Business' for mining. Certainly, we have been encouraged by recent moves in Sri Lanka to transfer the management of the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Industry, with associated positive public statements indicative of a progressive attitude to the sector from the Minister of Industry. Subsequent to the announcement of the National Minerals Policy, guidelines on the specific value addition requirements in the mineral sands sector are anticipated, and we have been very active in seeking to educate all stakeholders on a practical staged approach. Capital Metals is also seeking an additional Industrial Mining Licence (\"IML\") focussed on the proposed IMA and adjacent to the two existing approved IMLs.\n- Funding Plans\nDiscussions with banks and other investors to provide project debt and equity financing began in the Half-Year and are ongoing. The Company is also engaged in active discussions with preferred potential offtakers, with a focus on those that may also provide project equity or working capital funding.\nSeveral constructive meetings were held last month at the key global mineral sands conference in Kuala Lumpur. The recognised high quality of the Project's mineral products has attracted broad market interest, and counterparties have expressed positive interest in long-term supply arrangements.\n- Building Trust Through Action in Local Communities\nAmong the most important areas of progress in the Half-Year has been the strengthening of relationships with host communities in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province. Recent initiatives include sponsorship of local schools and A-Level education programmes, spiritual events, fishing societies, sporting associations, as well as the installation of community suggestion boxes to encourage open dialogue and support for environmental activities such as coastal beach clean-ups.\nDuring the period, Capital Metals, in association with the Urani Super Warriors Sports Club, sponsored a local cricket tournament branded the \"Capital Metals Cricket Cup\", with over 40 teams from around the eastern province coming together in an incredible display of talent and sportsmanship. The Company's Non-Executive Director and a Sri Lankan cricket hero, Aravinda De Silva, presented awards during the closing ceremony.\nAs part of the board's site visit, members donated a fishing boat to a local fishing society, a gesture that will directly benefit more than 50 families. The Company has also helped women's groups and small-scale agricultural projects to support local livelihoods. These activities reflect the Company's commitment to delivering sustainable, long-term benefits for local stakeholders alongside the advancement of the Taprobane Minerals Project.\nMineral sands mining is not well known in the Project area. This presents challenges in terms of awareness and understanding of the Company's proposed activities. The Company has been actively and successfully prioritising education and awareness programmes, both locally within the Project area and more broadly across the country, recognising that education is key to building long-term understanding and support. The Company's Sri Lankan Facebook account, launched during the Half-Year, has quickly amassed over a thousand followers and is a key channel for communication.\nThe Company is also in the process of establishing the first of a series of Coastal Regeneration Centres, focussed on the preferred native plants and regeneration practices required for rehabilitation over the life of the Project, while also providing a platform for students and the wider public to learn more about the Company's environmental practices.\n- In-Country Team Expansion and Capacity Building\nKey local appointments during the Half-Year include a Financial Controller, Mining Engineer, Project Manager and Processing Specialist, with recruitment ongoing for a Manager of Environment to lead the development of the operational Environmental Management Plan and detailed rehabilitation plans in coordination with the mine engineering team.\nThe team is also developing a heavy equipment training programme to upskill local employees and build long-term operational capacity.\n- Updated Financial Model and Increase in NPV\nA key piece of work in the Half-Year was the development of a new financial model including:\n\u00b7\nReduced Stage 1 capex of $20.9 million, as announced on 18 September 2025\n\u00b7\nRefinement of heavy equipment requirements using a first-principles approach\n\u00b7\nDetailed build-up of mining and processing operating costs\n\u00b7\nUpdated logistics costs following completion of logistics studies\n\u00b7\nResource increase to reflect indications from recent drilling results, with base and upside case resources modelled at 1.33x and 1.67x the existing MRE respectively\n\u00b7\nUpdated increased corporate tax and royalty assumptions\nThis resulted in materially improved Project economics, with the MRE upgrade assumptions being subsequently exceeded when the MRE for the IMA was published after the Half-Year end on 18 September 2025.\n\u00b7\nthe base case NPV8 (post tax) has increased to $180 million compared to $155 million;\n\u00b7\nthe upside case NPV8 (post tax) has increased to $289 million compared to $235 million;\n\u00b7\nthe base case IRR (post tax) has increased to 73% compared to 56%;\n\u00b7\nthe upside case IRR (post tax) has increased to 98% compared to 73%; and\n\u00b7\nthe updated NPV8 per share of 27p and 44p for base and upside cases, respectively.\n- Premium Garnet Quality Confirmed by Independent Testing\nThe results of a garnet product quality study announced in the Half-Year confirmed that the garnet is of a superior quality than previously thought and will therefore attract a higher price in the industrial abrasive market. The Company is in discussions with global garnet distributors regarding potential offtake agreements.\nFinancial Matters\nOn 29 May 2025, the Company announced a landmark strategic investment of $2 million into the Company by way of a share subscription by Ambeon Capital, together with an option for Ambeon Capital or its nominees to invest up to a further $2 million. By September 2025, the option was fully exercised by Ambeon Capital's nominees, bringing in $4 million in total from this strategic investment. This was supplemented by approximately a further $1 million from existing shareholder participation. These funding events are expected to see the Company comfortably funded through FID and beyond.\nAmbeon Capital is a Colombo Stock Exchange listed diversified conglomerate and part of one of Sri Lanka's most successful investment organisations. Ambeon Capital had been looking to enter Sri Lanka's mineral sands sector and has now become the Company's largest shareholder, owning c.12.15% of the Company. Given its connections in Sri Lanka, Ambeon Capital is already assisting in improving the speed and flow of information and communication with national stakeholders.\nAmbeon Capital and Capital Metals also signed a non-binding MoU for an agreed path to fund the Project at FID to commence construction, through arranging the provision of $20 million in equity/debt at the Project level, with such amount anticipated to be sufficient to complete Stage 1 development at which point the Project is expected to become self-funding.\nThe Company made a loss before income tax for the Half-Year of $1,069,078 compared to $446,781 in the corresponding period last year. The loss for the year increased primarily due to the significant accounting charge from the issuance of Silver Pine Pacific Limited share options in September 2025, together with higher expenses driven by increased Company activity levels, such as travel expenses and equity fundraising initiatives. These activities include the continuation of the drilling programme, advanced engineering, design and regulatory work for development, and strengthened presence in Sri Lanka ahead of construction. As at 30 September 2025, the Company had $4,781,609 in cash and cash equivalents (31 March 2025: $1,351,494).\nBoard Appointments\nIn August 2025, I had the honour to welcome two respected Sri Lankan business leaders to the Board of Capital Metals, Aravinda De Silva and Savanth Sebastian.\nAravinda De Silva is an ICC Cricket Hall of Fame inductee and national sporting icon who played a crucial part in Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup-winning team. He is making a significant positive impact in Sri Lanka as a businessman and investor, and he is already playing a key role in the development of the Taprobane Minerals Project.\nSavanth Sebastian is a leading business figure in Sri Lanka with considerable industry knowledge and expertise. He currently serves as a Director of Ambeon Capital, helping to shape its financial and investment strategies. He was a Director at Nations Trust Bank PLC of Sri Lanka and serves on the board of Sri Lanka's largest IT company.\nAravinda and Savanth played key roles in cementing Ambeon Capital's strategic investment in Capital Metals. The Company is working hard with Aravinda, Savanth and the Ambeon Capital team, with whom the Company now shares an office in Colombo, on many fronts to develop the Project that will create sustainable value for Sri Lanka in the form of jobs, skills, revenue, education, and training.\nOutlook\nThe Half-Year has been marked by substantial progress across all aspects of the Taprobane Minerals Project. From the exceptional results of the Phase 1 Aircore drilling programme at depth and the subsequent Mineral Resource Estimate upgrade to the advancement of engineering, regulatory, and commercial workstreams, the Company has continued to improve the foundations for Project development. Strategic investments from Ambeon Capital, alongside support from existing shareholders, have ensured the Company is well funded to complete the approvals and planning required to commence construction.\nThe Company now looks forward to continuing the deeper Aircore drilling across the balance of the Project where hopefully the trend seen in Phase 1 will continue to deliver similar multiples of resource increases. The implications of a similar increase across the whole resource make this a potentially multi-generational project. There remains a lot of work to do to determine the optimal pit sizes and how the resource will be processed, but it is clear that this will open up flexible mining options, including a combination of high-grade surface mining and significantly lower cost dredging for the deeper and wider deposits, subject to local approvals.\nWith a strengthened Board, including prominent Sri Lankans, growing local engagement, and an expanding social licence to operate, Capital Metals is firmly positioned to deliver a long-life, high-grade mineral sands operation that will create meaningful value for shareholders, local communities, and Sri Lanka. On behalf of the Board, I extend my sincere thanks to our employees, advisers, partners, and other stakeholders for their ongoing support in advancing this world-class asset.\nGreg Martyr\nExecutive Chairman\n18 December 2025\nCAPITAL METALS PLC -

It has been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK adopted international accounting standards.\nStatutory financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of Directors on 17 August 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified in relation to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed interim financial statements are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the Company's auditor.\n2.2 Accounting Policies\nExcept as described below, the same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation have been followed in these condensed interim financial statements as were applied in the preparation of the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nChanges in accounting policy and disclosures\n(a)\nNew and amended standards adopted by the Group and Company\nA number of new and amended standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have become effective for the first time for financial periods beginning on (or after) 1 April 2024 and have been applied by the Company and Group in these interim financial statements. None of these new and amended standards and interpretations had a significant effect on the Company or Group because they are either not relevant to the Company or Group's activities or require accounting which is consistent with the Company or Group's current accounting policies.\n(b) New standards, amendments and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective or not yet endorsed and not early adopted\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods, and which have not been adopted early.\n2.3 Going concern\nThese financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Given the Group's current cash position and its demonstrated ability to raise capital, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting preparing the condensed unaudited interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025.\nSince 31 March 2025, the Group has sourced additional financing validating the Directors decision to adopt the Going Concern assumption. The Directors continue to exercise due process when evaluating the liquidity of the Group and will continue to make certain assumptions with regards to the timing and amount of future expenditure over which they have control. Considering all the factors affecting the Group the Directors are confident in the ability of the Group to satisfy this condition and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these interim financial statements.\n2.4 Risks and uncertainties\nThe Board continuously assesses and monitors the key risks of the business. The key risks that could affect the Company's medium term performance and the factors that mitigate those risks have not substantially changed from those set out in the 2025 Annual Report, a copy of which is available on the Company's website: www.capitalmetals.com. The key financial risks are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk and fair value estimation.\n3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of condensed interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates are set out in the 31 March 2025 Annual Report. The nature and amounts of such estimates have not changed significantly during the interim period.\n4. Dividends\nNo dividend has been declared or paid by the Company during the six months ended 30 September 2025 (2024: $nil).\n5. Earnings per Share\nThe calculation for basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share is based on the total comprehensive loss after income tax attributable to equity shareholders for the period and is as follows:\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nPeriod ended30 Sep2025\nPeriod ended30 Sep2024\nYear ended31 March2025\nNet profit / (loss) for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders for continuing operations ($)\n(1,069,078)\n(446,781)\n(1,140,932)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue\n770,730,376\n701,083,711\n701,083,711\nBasic and diluted earnings per share for continuing operations (pence)\n(0.139)\n(0.064)\n(0.163)\nThere is no difference between the diluted loss per share and the basic loss per share presented. Share options and warrants could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive for the period presented.\n6.\nIntangible fixed assets\nThe movement in capitalised exploration and evaluation costs during the period was as follows:\nExploration & Evaluation at Cost and Net Book Value\n$\nOpening balance - 30 September 2024\n5,708,492\nAdditions\n308,719\nForeign Exchange\n38,080\nAs at 31 March 2025\n6,055,291\nOpening balance - 1 April 2025\n6,055,291\nAdditions\n663,729\nForeign Exchange\n(33,598)\nAs at 30 September 2025\n6,685,422\n7.

The Company extends its sincere thoughts to all those affected by this extreme weather event.\nCyclone Ditwah is considered an extremely rare meteorological event for Sri Lanka, with cyclonic systems of this intensity seldom forming so close to the island. Publicly reported data indicates that multiple districts were impacted by flooding, wind damage and temporary displacement of communities, with rainfall totals in some areas recorded at several multiples of seasonal averages and widespread power outages reported nationally.\nThe Company confirms that all Capital Metals' staff are safe. Personnel in the Eastern Province experienced a loss of grid power for approximately one week, however, power has now been restored to the region. Normal food and fuel supplies are also resuming following temporary disruption.\nThere has been no impact to the Company's Taprobane Minerals Project area or assets, and the Company does not foresee any material impact to its development plans, however, the government is clearly very focussed on the recovery efforts which are going to take some time. Capital Metals will be assisting with ongoing focussed local area crisis related support efforts.\nAs a reminder to shareholders, the Taprobane Minerals Project processing plant is being designed with its own off-grid power supply, reducing vulnerability to extreme weather events and mitigating the risk of disruption from any loss of grid power.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / Christopher Raggett / David Asquith\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Adviser)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).

The Project is one of the highest-grade mineral sands projects globally, with potential for further grade and resource expansion. In 2022, a third-party Preliminary Economic Assessment provided a Project NPV of US$155-235m based on existing resources, with further identified optimisation potential. We are committed to applying modern mining practices and bringing significant positive benefits to Sri Lanka and the local community.

The resultant economic HM% bottom cut from operational financial input will allow a re-reporting of the MRE should it be required. Both 2% HM and 5% HM model comparisons are presented with further drilling and optimisation work required to determine the most favourable cutoff.\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"This is a massive resource increase which exponentially exceeds our assumed upgrade for the Initial Mining Area when we updated the Project's financial model and NPV on 18 September 2025. We now look forward to continuing the deeper drilling across the balance of the Project where hopefully this trend will continue to deliver similar multiples of resource increase. The implications of a similar increase across the whole resource makes this a potentially multi-generational project.\nThere remains a lot of work to do to determine the optimal pit sizes and how the resource will be processed, but it is clear that this will open up flexible mining options, including a combination of high-grade surface mining and significantly lower cost dredging for the deeper and wider deposits, subject to local approvals.\nThese results clearly justify the ongoing drilling programme, which is expected to significantly increase the total Project resource and allow us to better understand our mining and processing alternatives, which will add to our overall valuation for what will clearly be a long life mine with a grade that is expected to remain among the highest in the world. In the meantime, we are going full steam ahead on the existing plans to start construction of the plant to get into cash flow by early 2027.\n\"\nNext steps\nExploration and resource development will continue subject to ongoing approvals to extend the current drill pattern southward through the remainder of EL168 and into the EL199 area. EL199 is similarly endowed with substantial resource addition potential to the west and at depth.\nTable 1. Comparison of Proposed IMA 2016",

Geo-metallurgical characterisation and density analysis for the first stage of the proposed Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") update have commenced.\nThe assay results have been returned from the Company's laboratory partners, Scientific Services Geological Laboratories, and the results of microscope logging of HM were returned from Remote Exploration Services, both based in Cape Town, South Africa.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFurther exceptional Total Heavy Mineral (\"THM\") grades have been confirmed from the third batch of 487 routine and QA samples from the nominal 400mN by 40mE aircore drilling grid, with Heavy Liquid Separation (\"HLS\") assays continuing to demonstrate high-grade mineralisation. This completes the HLS analysis of the first stage of the resource drilling in the initial mining area.\n\u00b7\nIntercepts above 10% HM are included below (at a 2% THM bottom cut):\no\n1m @ 44.7% THM from 0m in hole MUAC155\no\n2.7m @ 37.2% THM from 0m in hole MUAC156\no\n6m @ 21.7% THM from 6m in hole MUAC152\no\n3m @ 16.7% THM from 6m in hole MUAC131\no\n4m @ 14.9% THM from 8m in hole MUAC153\no\n2m @ 14.2% THM from 0m in hole MUAC141\no\n3m @ 11.5% THM from 0m in hole MUAC157\n\u00b7\nResults returned in Batch 3 are primarily infill drilling completed at 20mE spacing on the 400m N-spaced lines and the drilling of the eastern, beach formation.\n\u00b7\nThe existing MRE, in the proposed initial mining area, covers 47 hectares. However, aircore drilling assay results received to date indicate the mineralisation extends substantially to the west (and to depth) and now extends across 152 hectares using a bottom cut of 2% THM - around 300% larger.\n\u00b7\nPreliminary investigations of HM distribution suggest a number of stacked, high-HM grade palaeo-shorelines have been intersected in an older formation, from 200m to 1,100m inland and at a consistent depth of about 6m from surface. This new formation discovered at depth with multiple high-grade intercepts (e.g. as released for drill holes MUAC020 and MUAC054), will add materially to the existing resource when the MRE update is completed.\n\u00b7\nResults have been returned from all microscope logging of drill sample HM.\n\u00b7\nHM microscope logs have been combined with HM assay and geological field logs to generate a geological interpretation using 3D resource modelling software (Datamine Studio RM). Four geological domains have been identified and all carry moderate to high HM grades.\n\u00b7\nAll QA and QC data have been returned and processed. Results confirm a high level of precision and accuracy has continued, as is anticipated with a strong quality focus in both field and laboratory personnel and practices.\n\u00b7\n48 composite samples are being compiled for XRF and XRD analysis to geo-metallurgically characterise the mineralisation discovered in the four geological domains across the 152 hectare proposed initial mining area. These results will be incorporated into the proposed MRE to provide confidence in valuation for reserve optimisation and to inform production schedules.\n\u00b7\nNine locations have been chosen for density assessment for the proposed MRE update. The corresponding nine composite density samples have been compiled from four 1kg splits from retained drill samples stored at site. Each of the four geological domains, throughout the 152 hectare proposed initial mining area, are represented. Samples are being packaged to send to Western Geotechnical and Laboratory Services in Perth, Western Australia for detailed particle density analysis.\n\u00b7\nLidar topography data have been captured for the region and will be used to define the upper surface of the proposed MRE.\nFigure 1: Drill holes displayed by maximum THM% and resource area on an airphoto (note: not all holes shown due to scale of map).\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"We are very pleased with the final Phase 1 drilling results, which have confirmed not only consistently high heavy mineral grades but also a threefold increase in the surface area of t",

The results have been returned from the Company's laboratory partner, Scientific Services Geological Laboratories, based in Cape Town, South Africa.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFurther exceptional Total Heavy Mineral (\"THM\") grades have been confirmed from the second batch of 601 routine and QA samples from the 400mN by 40mE grid drilling (on top of the initial batch of 539 samples reported on 16 July 2025), with Heavy Liquid Separation assays continuing to demonstrate high-grade mineralisation. There are 466 remaining samples still being processed from the first phase of the drilling campaign.\n\u00b7\nDrill hole MUAC054 encountered 13m @ 13.3% THM grade and, within this, an exceptional 8m @ 20.6% from 6m depth and 1m at 60.7% from 11m depth. This compares favourably with the current Mineral Resource average grade of 17.6% THM, which extends to an average depth of just 1.6m.\n\u00b7\nIntercepts include:\no\n13m @ 13.3% THM from 1m in hole MUAC054\no\n6.3m @ 32.4% THM from 5m in hole MUAC028 (including 4.3m @ 44.6% THM from 7m)\no\n6m @ 10.9% THM from 0m in hole MUAC114\no\n3m @ 9.9% THM from 6m in hole MUAC063\no\n6m @ 7.2% THM from 6m in hole MUAC064\no\n6m @ 6.9% THM from 0m in hole MUAC113\no\n11m @ 6.4% THM from 0m in hole MUAC111\no\n7m @ 5.8% THM from 0m in hole MUAC115\no\n8m @ 5.2% THM from 0m in hole MUAC112\nNOTE: Intercepts are calculated using a 2% Heavy Mineral bottom cut.\n\u00b7\nThe existing Mineral Resource in the initial mining area covers 65 hectares, however, aircore drilling assay results received to date indicate the mineralisation remains open to the west and now extends across 159 hectares using a bottom cut of 2% THM.\n\u00b7\nMineralisation is also evident exceeding 10m depth in several locations (e.g. MUAC015, MUAC016, MUAC017, MUAC030, MUAC054, MUAC111), significantly deeper than the previous resource average depth.\n\u00b7\nA zone of very high-grade Heavy Minerals has also been discovered from ~5m depth (e.g. MUAC028) that extends 700m west of the previous resource boundary, with this area remaining open along strike pending proposed infill drilling at 100mN spacing. This work will commence upon completion of the regional 400mN by 40mE programme.\n\u00b7\nAll QA and QC data have been returned and processed. Results confirm a high level of precision and accuracy, as is anticipated with a strong quality focus in both field and laboratory personnel and practices.\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"Results to date indicate a significant extension of mineralisation and potential for many multiples of the existing resource to be achievable in the initial mining area. We are hopeful that applying the same methodology throughout the remainder of the resource area will continue this trend. We look forward to providing further reports as appropriate during the ongoing drilling campaign in order to support a targeted Mineral Resource upgrade before the end of this calendar year.\"\nNext Steps\nThe results from the remaining 456 routine and QA samples of the 400mN by 40mE grid drilling are pending. It is anticipated that these will reveal further high-grade mineralisation.\nHeavy Mineral sinks are undergoing microscope logging to determine their gross mineralogical characteristics. From this, composites of like mineral can be selected for geo-metallurgical characterisation by XRD, XRF, and QEMSCAN analysis. Applying these results will allow discrete mineralogical character to be incorporated in the proposed Mineral Resource Estimate update and inform the mining reserve and production schedules.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\n+44 (0)20 3368 3550\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Advisor)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).

Consequently, the parties have agreed to extend the option period for a further 30 days to 11 August 2025 (the \"Ambeon Option Extension\") to complete the subscription process and expect that this will be concluded before the end of the 30 day period. Firm commitments will be communicated to the market as soon as they are signed.\nRelated Party Transaction\nAs Ambeon is a substantial shareholder in the Company (by virtue of its 13.9% shareholding), the Ambeon Option Extension is treated as a related party transaction under AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. The Company's directors consider, having consulted with SPARK Advisory Partners Limited, the Company's nominated adviser, that the terms of the Ambeon Option Extension are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"It has been a busy period for the Company and we are very pleased with the support from Ambeon and its strategic partners who are rolling up their sleeves on many fronts to assist in accelerating the approvals required to start construction of the Taprobane Minerals Project. The process of closing Ambeon's $2 million option should hopefully be concluded shortly providing more than enough funding to get us through the Final Investment Decision scheduled before the end of this year.\"\nGrant of Share Options\nThe Company has granted share options to Mr Dinal Peiris to subscribe for 600,000 new Ordinary shares in the Company (the \"Peiris Options\") in consideration for his ongoing advice on matters in Sri Lanka and his role in the group restructuring in Sri Lanka announced on 20 February 2023.

The results have been returned from the Company's laboratory partner, Scientific Services Geological Laboratories, based in Cape Town, South Africa.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nExceptional Heavy Mineral grades with very low slimes content are a consistent characteristic of the first 539 routine and QA samples assayed by Heavy Liquid Separation\n\u00b7\nGrades over 60%, as visually observed and announced on 11 June, have now been confirmed by laboratory assay results\n\u00b7\nIntercepts include:\no\n6.3m @ 29.2% HM from 5m in hole MUAC028\no\n8m @ 19.9% HM from 0m in hole MUAC008\no\n4m @ 16.7% HM from 6m in hole MUAC025\no\n2.2m @ 23.4% HM from 0m in hole MUAC014\no\n7m @ 8.9% HM from 0m in hole MUAC007\no\n9m @ 6.2% HM from 1m in hole MUAC020\no\n12m @ 5.3% HM from 0m in hole MUAC015\no\n10m @ 5.2% HM from 0m in hole MUAC030\no\n11m @ 5.1% HM from 0m in hole MUAC016\n\u00b7\nThese results are extremely significant, particularly given the current Resource is only to an average depth of 1.6m and the current cut-off grade is 5%, with plans to reduce this to 2%\n\u00b7\nMineralisation is evident in coastal and inland areas, extending west of the known resource\n\u00b7\nAll QA and QC data have been returned, confirming a high level of precision and accuracy, as anticipated with a strong quality focus in both field and laboratory personnel and practices\n\u00b7\nA Competency of Personnel audit of laboratory services was completed during the month, with no advisory items reported\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"We are delighted with the initial drill assay results. Our visual observations of >60% grades have now been proven by laboratory assays, with several significant intercepts that carry important implications for the Project's overall mine life and mine planning. T\nhe results to date, together with what we expect from the ongoing drilling programme, should unearth a game changing Resource upgrade for the Company, targeted to be completed before the end of the year.\nWe would once again like to thank the GSMB for their continued support.\"\nNext Steps\nThe results from the remaining 1,042 samples of the 400mN by 40mE grid drilling and 20mE infill drilling are pending. It is anticipated that these will reveal further high-grade mineralisation, helping to better constrain both coastal and inland deposits for detailed analysis.\nHeavy Mineral sinks will be microscopically logged to determine their gross mineralogical characteristics to assist in the compositing of like intervals for XRD, XRF, and QEMSCAN analysis.\nT\nhe Company expects drilling operations to continue on site through July to September and will update the market as and when further assay results become available. The Company\nexpects the next phase of drilling to be completed in September, with plans to continue beyond this period - both in this region and in other areas of the Project - subject to ongoing regulatory approvals.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\n+44 (0)20 3368 3550\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Advisor)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).

The bonus to be awarded is payable as to (i) 30% in cash upon delivery of a minimum fundraise at the Company or Project level of US$2 million, and (ii) 70% on delivery of the FID, with the second amount payable as to 50% in cash and 50% in shares (priced at the 30-day volume weighted average price).\nThe remuneration plan reflects the relatively low base salary agreed in early 2023 and a preparedness of the Executive Chair to be rewarded on the achievement of milestones, including the Industrial Mining Licences being reinstated, raising gross proceeds of approximately \u00a33 million including by bringing in Sheffield Resources Limited as a strategic investor, and securing an up to US$4 million strategic investment by new Sri Lankan partners to fund the Company through to FID (which would occur when all approvals and funding are in place to commence construction). As such, the conditions for settlement of stage (i) of the remuneration plan have been met.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe remuneration plan is treated as a related party transaction under AIM Rule 13. As the recipient of the remuneration package, Greg Martyr is not independent and has not taken part in the Board's consideration of the remuneration plan. Kwan Wey, Bruce Griffin and James Leahy are the independent directors for this purpose. The independent directors consider, having consulted with SPARK Advisory Partners Limited, the Company's nominated adviser, that the terms of the remuneration plan are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nIssue of Equity\nCapital Metals also announces it will issue 283,355 Ordinary shares to Hannam & Partners in consideration of Broker and Financial Advisor fees at an issue price of 2.6106 pence per share (equal to \u00a37,397.26) (\"Fee Shares\"), based on the 30-day volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares prior to grant.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication has been made for the Fee Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings in the Fee Shares will commence at 8.00 a.m. on or around 19 June 2025. The Fee Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the Ordinary shares of the Company in issue.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in issue will be 429,118,616 with voting rights. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company's share capital pursuant to (i) the Company's Articles, (ii) the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and/or (iii) the AIM Rules for Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange plc as amended from time to time.\nDirector Shareholding\nCapital Metals was advised on 9 June 2025 that on 5 June 2025, Bruce Griffin, Non-Executive Director, transferred the 800,000 shares held by Fairview Solutions Limited (representing 0.19% of the Company's issued share capital) to a personal account. There has been no change to the beneficial ownership of the shares (being Mr Griffin and his spouse) as a result of the transfer.\nCapitalised terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings given to them as in the 29 May 2025 announcement released at 7.00 a.m.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\n+44 (0)20 3368 3550\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Advisor)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).

Whilst results are only estimates at this stage, extensive new mineralisation discovery is evident. This confirms our exploration model and validates our expectation of a substantial resource increase. There is, however, a lot more drilling to be completed before we know how consistent this expansion is over the whole Project. We are also in discussions with the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau regarding the phased implementation of the global practice of mining below the water table to access the deeper resources.\nWe'd like to thank our local stakeholders, particularly the GSMB, for their continued support and collaboration. We look forward to continuing the drilling programme which will further our understanding of the resource and assist with mine planning in the Initial Mining Area.\"\nFigure 1: Drill sample trays and panning profiles showing significantly deeper high-grade mineral intercepts\nNext Steps\nPhase 2 drilling expected to commence shortly to include\ncompletion of 400m north by 40m east spaced extensional drilling programme for the balance of the EL168 tenement in a southerly direction from the Phase 1 drilling (phasing to accommodate land ownership access). This would be followed up by infill drilling, based on results from Phases 1 and 2, for the proposed Initial Mining Area at a 100m north by 20m east drill pattern to provide greater definition of host material characteristics and mineral grade and assemblage which will increase the certainty of the mine plan and product schedule.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\n+44 (0)20 3368 3550\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Advisor)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).

Ambeon's investment is particularly pleasing as it effectively provides a funding path to get to FID and brings onto our shareholder register a company which is part of one of Sri Lanka's most successful organisations. They wish to enter the country's mineral sands sector, and we are pleased they have chosen our Project after considerable due diligence including speaking to many government stakeholders about the future of the Project.\nThe experience and connections of the Ambeon group will be invaluable in assisting with receiving the in-country approvals required, as well as demonstrating significant Sri Lankan ownership of an extremely important development project when the country is looking to attract foreign investment and advance its underdeveloped mining sector.\nI am delighted that alongside their strategic investment, we have outlined terms upon which we intend to collaborate in the development of the Project, with a proposed funding path that will be sufficient for the Project to become cash flow positive.\nA partnership of this nature with any investor would represent a major milestone but to be able to do it with a Sri Lankan company is truly significant. We look forward to concluding a definitive agreement and to working with Ambeon and its associates to deliver this exceptionally high-grade Project and its associated social and economic benefits.\nWe are also pleased that Sheffield Resources, with its considerable sector expertise, will invest further in the Company to maintain its shareholding.\"\nDr Sajeeva Narangoda, Chief Executive Officer of Ambeon Capital PLC, commented:\n\"This transaction aligns perfectly with Ambeon Capital's vision.

The purpose of the drilling is to increase the Mineral Resource, as well as to help with mine planning in particular for the IMA. A total of 380 metres across 41 drillholes have been completed in this programme to date. Previous hand auger drilling used to define the Mineral Resource only went to an average depth of 1.6 metres, whereas the aircore rig in use is drilling to depths of up to 15 metres before intersecting basement lithologies.\nThe programme includes specific targets of new beach placers at depth and further inland. The Company is pleased to announce that drilling has intersected a second marine sand package considered to have been deposited during the Pleistocene epoch. Estimated heavy mineral grades are high, and work is ongoing to define the extent of this new mineralisation and the impact on the resource within the IMA and across the Project, with more targeted drilling to be planned. All drill samples will be analysed and subsequently domained according to geological formation and updates will be provided when available. By doing this, discrete geo-metallurgical classification can be conducted on the surface (Holocene) and buried (Pleistocene) domains and their individual mineralogical and economic character can be assessed during the optimisation of the resource for mining.\nIn addition to targeting extensions to the Mineral Resource, the current phase of the drill programme will assist the Company in outlining the perimeters of the IMA, determining optimal locations for mining cells and the location of the Wet Concentrator Plant site. Planned infill drilling will provide greater definition of host material characteristics and mineral grade and assemblage which will increase the certainty of the mine plan and product schedule through different geological domains. The drilling programme is scheduled to continue in a southerly direction with land access in a number of areas already obtained, and an ongoing process to obtain additional land access agreements as and when required.\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"Drilling is progressing well with the cooperation and participation of the Geological Survey & Mines Bureau. This drilling campaign is targeted at significantly increasing the size and hopefully grade of the Mineral Resource and is an important component of the plan to reach a Final Investment Decision. It will also assist us in determining the specifics of the mining plan, enhancing our knowledge of the make-up of the products, and dictating where to locate mining cells and to site the plant. We look forward to updating shareholders on further observations in due course with assays targeted to be received over the summer.\"\nClick here to watch a short video message from Stuart Forrester, Chief Operating Officer, at the drill site:\nhttps://youtu.be/YWCi_SFA83s?si=J0pBvLMGIwr7_VgW/\n.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\n+44 (0)20 3368 3550\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Advisor)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).

The Company is finalising the last renewal of land access permissions, with the air core drilling rig and team on standby.\nThe drilling programme aims to increase the Project's resource, and inform ongoing design, engineering and mine planning work, whilst obtaining greater geological confidence in the proposed mining areas. The drilling programme was delayed due to Sri Lanka's elections which resulted in widespread ministerial and senior personnel changes across all departments. The Company does not currently expect any impact to its target of reaching a Final Investment Decision (\"FID\") in Q2 2025 in order to commence construction, with an expected 9-12-month construction period until first production.\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"We appreciate our shareholders have been eagerly awaiting updates on drilling. The election of a new government created personnel changes at many levels. We have been working positively and co-operatively with all our new stakeholders as they have come into their new roles. We wanted to have the GSMB actively involved in the drilling programme, and I am pleased we now have their agreement in hand to facilitate their participation with a view to commencing as soon as the final land access approval has been refreshed.\nI am currently in Sri Lanka with our COO, Stuart Forrester. The team, supported by our technical consultants, are making good progress on key workstreams required to reach FID, including plant design and logistics. I'm impressed with our field office staff and the rapport they are building with the local community. On the financing side, we continue to advance dialogue with offtakers, vendor financiers, and potential Sri Lankan project partners to finance the Project in a way that minimises or eliminates the requirement to raise market equity.\"\n*Project Renaming\nThe Taprobane Minerals Project is the new name for the Eastern Minerals Project, chosen for its positive historical significance and community resonance as the ancient Greek name for Sri Lanka.\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners (Nominated Adviser)\nNeil Baldwin / James Keeshan\n+44 (0)20 3368 3550\nTavira Financial\nJonathan Evans / Oliver Stansfield\n+44 (0)20 7100 5100\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET).

ON PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n2 December 2024\nCapital Metals plc\n(\"Capital Metals\" or the \"Company\")\nProject Update: Significant Capex Reduction for Stage 1 Production\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nStage 1 capex reduced by approximately one third to $20.9m\n\u00b7\nReduction through process rationalisation, with further optimisation expected\n\u00b7\n125,000tpa high grade (>95%) stage 1 HMC production with upside following drilling\n\u00b7\nFunding discussions ongoing with offtakers, vendor-financiers and potential local Sri Lankan partners to fund stage 1 Project capex, with subsequent expansion from operational cashflow\n\u00b7\nDrilling recommencing targeting significant resource increase and mine plan certainty\n\u00b7\nService agreements entered into with Mineral Technologies and Access Group\nCapital Metals (AIM: CMET), a mineral sands company approaching mine development stage at the high-grade Eastern Minerals Project in Sri Lanka (the \"Project\"), is pleased to provide the following Project update.\nOver the past six months, the Company has been focused on establishing a development plan which significantly reduces the circa $30m stage 1 capex from the May 2022 Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\"), whilst expediting cashflow. Leveraging updated knowledge and implementing numerous process improvements since the PEA, the Company is pleased to report that the estimated capex has reduced to $20.9 million, with further optimisation opportunities identified for potential cost reductions.\nThe targeted initial production of Heavy Mineral Concentrate (\"HMC\"), based on the same projected throughput rate in the PEA of 550,000tpa is forecast to be 125,000tpa, with upside based on expected higher grades in the chosen initial mining area.\nThe Company has also been in active dialogue with offtakers, vendor financiers, and potential Sri Lankan project partners to finance the Project in a way that minimises or eliminates the requirement for the Company to raise market equity for the funding task. This approach is also significantly less time consuming than traditional project debt.\nThe result of this work is that the Company now has an approach that fast-tracks production, significantly reduces initial capex, and enables the Project to become self-funding as quickly as practicable. This strategy also supports incremental expansions of production capacity and product quality through various plant value additions over time.\nBased on the costs in the PEA, which the Company believes are conservative, the Company is confident of achieving significant operating margins over the life of the Project. The Company is targeting a Final Investment Decision (\"FID\") in Q2 2025 in order to commence construction, with an expected 9-12-month construction period until first production.\nThe process rationalisation studies included: eliminating the need to wash the concentrate (following numerous discussions with potential offtakers) and reducing associated infrastructure at the port; transitioning to truck and shovel mining to avoid costly in-pit mining units; and utilising an off-the-shelf predesigned wet concentrator plant from Mineral Technologies.\nSummary of First Stage Production Criteria\n\u00b7\nClean beach sand means minimal screening required\n\u00b7\nMining rate: 180tph plant feed rate to achieve 550,000tpa\n\u00b7\nProduct: high grade HMC of 125,000tpa\n\u00b7\nLoader and truck approach, with tails returned immediately to the prior mine void\n\u00b7\n3-stage wet concentrator spiral circuit delivering high zircon and titanium recoveries (>98%)\n\u00b7\nNo final product screening necessary to produce high grade HMC (>95%)\n\u00b7\nCapex requirement: $20.9 million, with the potential for further optimisation\nSubsequent phases incorporate: incremental mining rates of up to 1.65Mtpa, and potentially beyond, subject to expected increases in the resource; a magnetic separation plant to produce final ilmenite and garnet products and zircon and rutile in concentrate; and a non-magnetic separation plant in the final stage to produce final zircon and rutile products in addition to the ilmenite and garnet.\nRecommencement of Drilling Activities\nGiven the Sri Lankan parliamentary elections have concluded and the new ministers relevant to the Company's activities have been appointed, the Company is mobilising the drilling rig and team to recommence drilling activities. The purpose of the drilling is to increase the resource, as well as to help with design and engineering, mine planning and to obtain greater geological confidence in the proposed mining areas. Updates will be announced when appropriate.\nService Agreements\nThe Company is pleased to announce ",

The Project is one of the highest-grade mineral sands projects globally, with potential for further grade and resource expansion.

Sunil Handunneththi MP, Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of Industry & Entrepreneurship Development, as the country\u2019s Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) came under his Ministry's purview. Some key highlights from the minister\u2019s address: \u201cAs the Minister of Industries, based on my experience over the past year, I am committed to advancing the industrial sector - particularly the mineral resources industry - to strengthen the national economy, enhance export earnings, and foster innovation.\u201d \u201cSri Lanka must attract genuine investors with the capacity to bring meaningful and sustainable investment to the country. The global market possesses many such stakeholders, and it is essential to identify and engage them appropriately.\u201d \u201cOur ultimate aim is to ensure that the nation\u2019s mineral wealth is developed sustainably, protected environmentally, and preserved responsibly for the benefit of future generations.\u201d \u201cThe first step towards achieving this goal is to secure Parliamentary approval for the National Mineral Policy and to ensure that it is well communicated both nationally and internationally.\u201d We\u2019re delighted with the positive actions being taken by the government which is finalising its new National Minerals Policy, demonstrating the country is now open for business in the minerals sector.\"",

On the other hand if TS gets Lic approval then it augers very well for CMET. It shows despite protests that the gov are really determined to get Mining going and as CMET have engaged positively socially and have good relations on the ground with locals there is little opposition to holding the project back. https://www.rvasia.org/asian-news/sri-lanka-protest-protect-mannar-environment-reaches-100th-day#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the ,that%20had%20triggered%20public%20opposition. https://capitalmetals.com/careers/#:~:text=Interested%20in%20working%20for%20Capital ,Lanka%20(Pvt)%20Ltd%20(Ampara%20District%2Dbased)",

New expanded IMA due to the ongoing drill results and have applied for an additional ML.  Lots of work done on the logistics and hydrogeology, I guess some of that is to aid the dredging plans in the future.  Improved financials all look good.  Was listening to a Sheffield resources presentation yesterday and they also export ilmenite and zircon concentrates to China (from Australia), so a similar set up planned here.  Phase 1 for us will be an all in one concentrate.  Sounds like progress being made on all fronts and still hoping to get FID done this year, Sheffield's presentation suggested high demand for these commodities so the offtake pricing etc could be interesting.  Good that the company want to maintain momentum and will be interesting to hear the presentation next week. Regards, Ed.",

Ambeon are helping on a number of fronts with the government which is certainly a positive that they are an active shareholder.  Greg comes across as professional, thoroughly ticking off the boxes and working closely with the community.  They'll be continuously doing phased as the project progresses so it all sounds really positive.  Like the last update suggested they've debt and equity proposals for full funding.  May accelerate the development after 6 months of production, also his comments on the development of the deeper resource sound interesting too as the country wants to establish the value of its various mineral resources.

We might even have more drill results in the coming Q too.  Now that the company is sitting on around $5.5m in cash the continuous drilling should help sustain our momentum.  I'm certainly looking forward to see what the MRE upgrade does to our already large NPV. Regards, Ed.",

They didn\u2019t feel the need to attend, as things were moving forward. In my case, I had put too much of the family money in! I now feel that it was the right decision! Risky yes, but the return should reflect the risk as we move forward. It was interesting, I asked Greg what percentage of the shareholders did he know. The answer was 60%. The company is not going to get whisked away from us, without giving us shareholders the value of the potential! This was confirmed by Greg, management are aligned with shareholders, and I looked into their eyes when I asked that! I am a cynic when it comes to directors on aim, but I do believe in this case that they will be fair. Any offer for the company would  have to be consensual, but as we move forward with the size of our resource, we might be on someone\u2019s radar.",

I also believe for the 2nd $2 million investment took longer as they wanted make sure everything adds up properly before put their money. It's a long and painful wait but I believe a lot will happen over the next 3 months and share price will be very different to today's price in the next 3 months. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

There seems to be huge operational pressure on Sheffield currently. The fact that Sheffield-even with their troubles still want to retain 10% of CMET and not cash out is \"very\" positive for CMET i.m.o.

Sunil Handunneththi MP, Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of Industry & Entrepreneurship Development, as the country\u2019s Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) came under his Ministry's purview. Some key highlights from the minister\u2019s address: \u201cAs the Minister of Industries, based on my experience over the past year, I am committed to advancing the industrial sector - particularly the mineral resources industry - to strengthen the national economy, enhance export earnings, and foster innovation.\u201d \u201cSri Lanka must attract genuine investors with the capacity to bring meaningful and sustainable investment to the country. The global market possesses many such stakeholders, and it is essential to identify and engage them appropriately.\u201d \u201cOur ultimate aim is to ensure that the nation\u2019s mineral wealth is developed sustainably, protected environmentally, and preserved responsibly for the benefit of future generations.\u201d \u201cThe first step towards achieving this goal is to secure Parliamentary approval for the National Mineral Policy and to ensure that it is well communicated both nationally and internationally.\u201d We\u2019re delighted with the positive actions being taken by the government which is finalising its new National Minerals Policy, demonstrating the country is now open for business in the minerals sector.\"",

I'd love to see if Greg does pick up additional assets as battery metals were mentioned in the recent presentation.  Manganese or graphite would make an interesting addition, as indeed would another mineral sands project.  Exciting times for sure, hopefully have a strong move into Christmas. Regards, Ed.",

There is equally strong opposition to the sand mining at mannar. If TS dont get the go ahead then apart from Lanka Min. there is only CMET as a player in producing badly needed revenue and jobs from sand mining for the Gov. On the other hand if TS gets Lic approval then it augers very well for CMET. It shows despite protests that the gov are really determined to get Mining going and as CMET have engaged positively socially and have good relations on the ground with locals there is little opposition to holding the project back. https://www.rvasia.org/asian-news/sri-lanka-protest-protect-mannar-environment-reaches-100th-day#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the ,that%20had%20triggered%20public%20opposition. https://capitalmetals.com/careers/#:~:text=Interested%20in%20working%20for%20Capital ,Lanka%20(Pvt)%20Ltd%20(Ampara%20District%2Dbased)",

Love Greg's world class description.  Surprised we're only up a little bit today.  I guess some are waiting for the listing in Colombo and for the resource upgrade itself when it comes.

Its certainly heading in the right direction from an operational perspective, hiring the necessary staff as you say and getting in house influence upon the Sri Lankan authorities (mining experience), even local celebrities.  The Colombo listing of the subsidiary is a master stroke to make the company more Sri Lankan.  Wage bill is going up, but also cash is looking strong now too and by all accounts FID seems to have been reached with the preparation of the final funding and construction due to start within months.  We could be seeing production late next year and then be self funding.  The upcoming resource upgrade will help get the story out there too. Regards, Ed.",

Lots of work done on the logistics and hydrogeology, I guess some of that is to aid the dredging plans in the future.  Improved financials all look good.  Was listening to a Sheffield resources presentation yesterday and they also export ilmenite and zircon concentrates to China (from Australia), so a similar set up planned here.  Phase 1 for us will be an all in one concentrate.  Sounds like progress being made on all fronts and still hoping to get FID done this year, Sheffield's presentation suggested high demand for these commodities so the offtake pricing etc could be interesting.  Good that the company want to maintain momentum and will be interesting to hear the presentation next week. Regards, Ed.",

Ambeon are helping on a number of fronts with the government which is certainly a positive that they are an active shareholder.  Greg comes across as professional, thoroughly ticking off the boxes and working closely with the community.  They'll be continuously doing phased as the project progresses so it all sounds really positive.  Like the last update suggested they've debt and equity proposals for full funding.  May accelerate the development after 6 months of production, also his comments on the development of the deeper resource sound interesting too as the country wants to establish the value of its various mineral resources.

We might even have more drill results in the coming Q too.  Now that the company is sitting on around $5.5m in cash the continuous drilling should help sustain our momentum.  I'm certainly looking forward to see what the MRE upgrade does to our already large NPV. Regards, Ed.",

They didn\u2019t feel the need to attend, as things were moving forward. In my case, I had put too much of the family money in! I now feel that it was the right decision! Risky yes, but the return should reflect the risk as we move forward. It was interesting, I asked Greg what percentage of the shareholders did he know. The answer was 60%. The company is not going to get whisked away from us, without giving us shareholders the value of the potential! This was confirmed by Greg, management are aligned with shareholders, and I looked into their eyes when I asked that! I am a cynic when it comes to directors on aim, but I do believe in this case that they will be fair. Any offer for the company would  have to be consensual, but as we move forward with the size of our resource, we might be on someone\u2019s radar.",

I also believe for the 2nd $2 million investment took longer as they wanted make sure everything adds up properly before put their money.

There seems to be huge operational pressure on Sheffield currently.

Sunil Handunneththi MP, Sri Lanka\u2019s Minister of Industry & Entrepreneurship Development, as the country\u2019s Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) came under his Ministry's purview. Some key highlights from the minister\u2019s address: \u201cAs the Minister of Industries, based on my experience over the past year, I am committed to advancing the industrial sector - particularly the mineral resources industry - to strengthen the national economy, enhance export earnings, and foster innovation.\u201d \u201cSri Lanka must attract genuine investors with the capacity to bring meaningful and sustainable investment to the country. The global market possesses many such stakeholders, and it is essential to identify and engage them appropriately.\u201d \u201cOur ultimate aim is to ensure that the nation\u2019s mineral wealth is developed sustainably, protected environmentally, and preserved responsibly for the benefit of future generations.\u201d \u201cThe first step towards achieving this goal is to secure Parliamentary approval for the National Mineral Policy and to ensure that it is well communicated both nationally and internationally.\u201d We\u2019re delighted with the positive actions being taken by the government which is finalising its new National Minerals Policy, demonstrating the country is now open for business in the minerals sector.\"",

Capital Metals is pleased to note that Sheffield's entire shareholding (approximately 10% of the issued share capital) was placed out with new institutional and high net worth investors including existing shareholders and associates of Ambeon Capital PLC in Sri Lanka, the Company's largest shareholder (owning 12.1% of the issued share capital).\nGreg Martyr, Executive Chairman of Capital Metals, commented:\n\"We appreciate the support of Sheffield as a strategic investor, including several follow-on investments as recently as September 2025 to maintain its shareholding. We understand the context in which Sheffield has sold its position, given the well-publicised working capital challenges in relation to its Thunderbird Mineral Sands Mine in Western Australia. Demand from other high-quality investors, including Sri Lankans, has enabled Sheffield's holding to be fully transferred.\"\nFor further information,\nplease visit\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nor contact:\nCapital Metals plc\nGreg Martyr (Executive Chairman)\nVia Vigo Consulting\nVigo Consulting (Investor Relations)\nBen Simons / Peter Jacob\n+44 (0)20 7390 0234\ncapitalmetals@vigoconsulting.com\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nRitchie Balmer / Christopher Raggett / David Asquith\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nHannam & Partners (Broker & Financial Adviser)\nAndrew Chubb / Leif Powis\n+44 (0)20 7907 8500\nAbout Capital Metals\nCapital Metals is a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CMET). We are developing the Taprobane Minerals Project in Sri Lanka, approximately 220km east of Colombo, containing industrial minerals including ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and garnet. The Project is one of the highest-grade mineral sands projects globally, with potential for further grade and resource expansion. In 2022, a third-party Preliminary Economic Assessment provided a Project NPV of US$155-235m based on existing resources, with further identified optimisation potential. We are committed to applying modern mining practices and bringing significant positive benefits to Sri Lanka and the local community. We expect over 300 direct new jobs to be created and over US$150m in direct government royalties and taxes to be paid.\nVisit our website:\nwww.capitalmetals.com\nFollow us on social media:\nX:\n@MetalsCapital\nLinkedIn:\n@Capital Metals plc\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

There is equally strong opposition to the sand mining at mannar. If TS dont get the go ahead then apart from Lanka Min. there is only CMET as a player in producing badly needed revenue and jobs from sand mining for the Gov. On the other hand if TS gets Lic approval then it augers very well for CMET. It shows despite protests that the gov are really determined to get Mining going and as CMET have engaged positively socially and have good relations on the ground with locals there is little opposition to holding the project back. https://www.rvasia.org/asian-news/sri-lanka-protest-protect-mannar-environment-reaches-100th-day#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the ,that%20had%20triggered%20public%20opposition. https://capitalmetals.com/careers/#:~:text=Interested%20in%20working%20for%20Capital ,Lanka%20(Pvt)%20Ltd%20(Ampara%20District%2Dbased)",

There is equally strong opposition to the sand mining at mannar. If TS dont get the go ahead then apart from Lanka Min. there is only CMET as a player in producing badly needed revenue and jobs from sand mining for the Gov. On the other hand if TS gets Lic approval then it augers very well for CMET. It shows despite protests that the gov are really determined to get Mining going and as CMET have engaged positively socially and have good relations on the ground with locals there is little opposition to holding the project back. https://www.rvasia.org/asian-news/sri-lanka-protest-protect-mannar-environment-reaches-100th-day#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20the ,that%20had%20triggered%20public%20opposition. https://capitalmetals.com/careers/#:~:text=Interested%20in%20working%20for%20Capital ,Lanka%20(Pvt)%20Ltd%20(Ampara%20District%2Dbased)",
