Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n10 December 2025\nCRISM Therapeutics Corporation\n(\"CRISM\", \"CRISM Therapeutics\" or the \"Company\")\nPlacing of \u00a31,000,000\nCRISM Therapeutics Corporation (AIM: CRTX),\na UK clinical stage company\nfocused on the localised and sustained delivery of chemotherapy drugs, is pleased to announce that it has successfully raised \u00a31,000,000 by way of an oversubscribed placing of 11,111,112 new ordinary shares of no par value each in the Company (\"\nPlacing Shares\n\") at a price of 9 pence per share (the \"\nIssue Price\n\") (the \"\nPlacing\n\"). The Placing Shares each have an attaching grant of warrants (\"Warrants\") on a one for two basis, exercisable at a price of 15 pence per ordinary share, and expiring on 31 December 2026.\nThe Placing Shares will represent approximately 21.76%\nof the Company's enlarged issued share capital following the Placing.\u00a0The Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 18.18\nper cent. to the closing mid-market price of 9\npence per ordinary share on 09 December 2025.\nThe Placing was undertaken by the Company's broker, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP.\nThe Company values its retail shareholder base and believes that it is appropriate to provide existing retail and other shareholders the opportunity to purchase shares at the Issue Price. The Company intends to carry out a separate retail offer to raise further gross proceeds of up to \u00a3100,000 via the BookBuild Platform (the \"\nRetail Offer\n\"). A further announcement will be made shortly regarding the Retail Offer and its terms.\nHighlights of the Placing:\n- Completion of Placing raising \u00a31,000,000 through the issue of 11,111,112 Placing Shares at 9 pence per share\n- The net proceeds of the Placing will allow the Company to progress its MHRA approved Phase 2 open label clinical trial of irinotecan-ChemoSeed in patients with surgically resectable glioblastoma. Specifically, funds will be used for:\no\nSterilisation and lot release of GMP of ChemoSeed\no\nQP, quality and audit fees\no\nClinical trial costs - ongoing fees, dose escalation seeking efficacy signal in recurrent patients\no\nOngoing operational costs\n- A separate retail offer to existing holders will be launched shortly\nCRISM Executive Chairman, Andrew Webb, said:\n\"We are delighted by the support of new and existing shareholders in this oversubscribed Placing, which will enable the Company to progress into patient dosing in its Phase 2 clinical trial of irinotecan-ChemoSeed in glioblastoma and to reach the important inflexion point of establishing an efficacy signal in patients with recurrent disease, subject to patient recruitment. We look forward to first patient dosing in Q1 2026.\"\nRationale for the Placing\nThe Placing will enable the Company to progress its Phase 2 open-label clinical trial, with first patients expected to be dosed in Q1 2026. The open label trial design allows for ongoing safety and efficacy monitoring.\nDirectors' Participation and Related Party Transactions\nThe Directors of the Company have participated in the Placing, details of which are in the table below:\nDirector\nNumber of Placing Shares subscribed for\nNumber of ordinary shares held immediately following Admission\n% interest in ordinary shares immediately following Admission\nAndrew Webb\n916,667\n7,297,190\n14.29%\nChris McConville\n83,333\n4,992,033\n9.77%\nGerry Beaney\n111,111\n268,793\n0.53%\nThe participation of Andrew Webb, Chris McConville and Gerry Beaney in the Placing (including the issue of the Warrants referred to below) constitutes related party transactions for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. As all of the Directors are participating in the Placing, there is no independent director for the purpose of the related party transaction as stipulated by the AIM Rules for Companies.\nThe Company's nominated adviser, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP, considers that the Directors' participation in, and the terms of, the Placing is fair and reasonable in so far as CRISM's shareholders are concerned.\nWarrants\nThe Company will issue participants of the Placing with one Warrant for every two Placing Shares. As a result, 5,555,551 Warrants will be issued to the placees. Each Warrant will provide the holder with the right to one new ordinary share on its exercise. The Warrants will be exercisable at a price of 15 pence until 31 December 2026.\nAndrew Webb, Chris McConville and Gerry Beaney, have been issued with 458,333, 41,666 and 55,555 Warrants respectively, as a result of their participation in the Placing.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Placing Shares (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and that trading will commence in the Placing Shares at 8.00 a.m. on or around 15 December 2025, or such later date as may be agreed between the Company and SP Angel. The Placing Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing ordinary shares.\nFollowing the issue of the Placing Shares, the total issued share capital of the Company will consist of 51,072,934 ordinary shares. The Company does not hold any ordinary shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is 51,072,934 and this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nCompany\nNomad and Broker\nFinancial PR\nCRISM Therapeutics Corporation\nS.P.

This directs that therapeutic concentrations of chemotherapy drugs reach the deep-seated tumour tissue or cover the entire resection margin. In the case of treating glioblastoma, ChemoSeeds can be implanted during surgery thereby bypassing the blood brain barrier, which prevents other treatments from being able to reach the tumour and be effective.\nCRISM will initiate its\u00a0registration-grade Phase 2 clinical trial\u00a0of\u00a0irinotecan-ChemoSeed\u2122\u00a0in patients with\u00a0surgically resectable glioblastoma in Q1 2026.\nFor more information please visit:\nhttps://www.crismtherapeutics.com/\nThe Company's LEI is 213800XFW6MKVCHHPW88.\nDealings by Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated\na)\nName\n1) Andrew Webb\n2) Gerald Beaney\n3) Chris McConville\n2\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status\n1) Executive Chairman\n2) Non-Executive Director\n3) Chief Scientific Officer\nb)\nInitial notification /Amendment\nInitial Notification\n3\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName\nCRISM Therapeutics Corporation\nb)\nLEI\n213800XFW6MKVCHHPW88\n4\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument\nOrdinary shares with no par value\nIdentification code\nISIN: VGG042401262\nb)\nNature of the transaction\nPurchase of shares\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s)\nDirector/PDMR\nPrice (\u00a3)\nVolume\nAndrew Webb\n0.09\n916,667\nGerald Beaney\n0.09\n111,111\nChris McConville\n0.09\n83,333\nd)\nAggregated information\n- Aggregated volume\nN/A\n- Price\nN/A\ne)\nDate of the transaction\n10 December 2025\nf)\nPlace of the transaction\nOutside a trading venue\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities / person closely associated\na)\nName\n1) Andrew Webb\n2) Gerald Beaney\n3) Chris McConville\n2\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status\n1) Executive Chairman\n2) Non-Executive Director\n3) Chief Scientific Officer\nb)\nInitial notification /Amendment\nInitial Notification\n3\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName\nCRISM Therapeutics Corporation\nb)\nLEI\n213800XFW6MKVCHHPW88\n4\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument\nOrdinary shares with no par value\nIdentification code\nISIN: VGG042401262\nb)\nNature of the transaction\nIssue of warrants\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s)\nDirector/PDMR\nExercise Price\nVolume\nAndrew Webb\n\u00a30.15\n458,333\nGerald Beaney\n\u00a30.15\n55,555\nChris McConville\n\u00a30.15\n41,666\nd)\nAggregated information\n- Aggregated volume\nN/A\n- Price\nN/A\ne)\nDate of the transaction\n10 December 2025\nf)\nPlace of the transaction\nOutside a trading venue\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
