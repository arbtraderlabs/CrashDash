CRISM's winning paper, presents foundational research and preclinical validation for ChemoSeed, CRISM's proprietary localised chemotherapy delivery technology designed to maximise on-target efficacy while minimising systemic toxicity. It highlights ChemoSeed's translational potential as a safe and effective treatment for glioblastoma.\nThe award was selected by a panel of internationally recognised scientists and will be formally presented at the upcoming CRS Annual Meeting, taking place in Philadelphia, PA in July 2025.\nProf. Chris McConville, Chief Scientific Officer at CRISM and lead author of the paper, commented:\n\"We are honoured to receive this recognition from CRS, a global authority in drug delivery science. This award not only reflects the quality of our research but provides strong third-party validation of the scientific underpinnings of ChemoSeed. It reinforces the promise of our platform to deliver targeted, sustained therapeutic action directly at the tumour site in glioblastoma patients. This accolade highlights the innovative potential of ChemoSeed and its ability to redefine treatment delivery for solid tumours. It is a testament to our team's commitment to advancing safer, more effective therapies.\"\nThe full article is available in the February 2024 issue of\nDrug Delivery and Translational Research\n, published by Springer and at the following link\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13346-024-01524-x\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nCompany\nNomad and Broker\nFinancial PR\nCRISM Therapeutics Corporation\nS.P.

Further details are set out in the Notice of AGM, which has been posted to shareholders today.\nA copy Notice of AGM can be accessed from the Company\u00b4s website at:\nhttps://www.crismtherapeutics.com/documents-and-notices\nEMI Option Plan\nIncluded within the Notice of AGM is a resolution for a proposed Enterprise Management Incentives Option Plan (the \"EMI Option Plan\"). The EMI Option Plan is intended to be used to help recruit, retain and incentivise key talent and align employee and shareholder interests by providing eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire ordinary shares in CRISM at a fixed price. There are also schedules to the EMI Option Plan which enable the Company to grant non-tax favoured unapproved options to certain people who are engaged by the Group, including advisors, consultants and non-executive directors, but who would not be eligible to receive tax-favoured EMI options under the EMI Option Plan.\nOptions under the EMI Option Plan would vest in three equal portions over a two-year period and be exercisable on the second anniversary of their vesting. The exercise price is expected to be the closing price of the underlying shares on the day prior to the grant, as may be agreed with HMRC from time to time. Options would lapse after 10 years. The total of options granted under the EMI Option Plan will be limited to a maximum of 10% of the Company's issued share capital.\nAll directors are eligible to receive options in the Company under the EMI Option Plan, which is considered a related party transaction pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. The Company's Nominated Adviser, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP, considers the terms of the EMI Option Plan and director eligibility to receive options pursuant to the EMI Option Plan to be fair and reasonable insofar as CRISM's shareholders are concerned.\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nCompany\nNomad and Broker\nFinancial PR\nCRISM Therapeutics Corporation\nS.P.
