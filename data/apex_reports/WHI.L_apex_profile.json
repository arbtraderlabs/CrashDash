Headquartered in Jersey, the Enlarged Group will serve private, intermediary, and institutional clients through discretionary investment management, financial planning and advisory services.\n\u25cf\nThe Enlarged Group will benefit from broader client reach, complementary regulatory permissions, and greater operational efficiency, providing a stable, independent alternative to larger consolidators in the UK and international wealth management (\n\"WM\"\n) sector.\n\u25cf\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition, each WH Ireland Shareholder will be entitled to receive:\nfor each WH Ireland Share :\n0.195\nNew Team Shares\n\u25cf\nUpon completion of the Acquisition, WH Ireland Shareholders will hold approximately\n43.5\nper cent. and Team Shareholders will hold approximately\n56.5\nper cent. of the Enlarged Share Capital.\n\u25cf\nBased on the Exchange Ratio and the Closing Price of\n27.5\npence per Team Share on the Latest Practicable Date, the Acquisition values each WH Ireland Share at approximately\n5.4\npence, and WH Ireland's entire issued share capital at approximately \u00a3\n12.7\nmillion.\n\u25cf\nBased on the Exchange Ratio and the Closing Price of 27.5 pence per Team Share on the Latest Practicable Date, the Acquisition price represents a premium of approximately:\no\n257.5 per cent. to the undisturbed Closing Price of 1.5 pence per WH Ireland Share on 12 November 2025 (being the day of the commencement of the Offer Period);\no\n406.6 per cent. to the volume-weighted average price of approximately 1.1 pence per WH Ireland Share for the 60-day trading period ended 12 November 2025 (being the day of the commencement of the Offer Period); and\no\n405.9 per cent. to the volume-weighted average price of approximately 1.1 pence per WH Ireland Share for the 90-day trading period ended 12 November 2025 (being the day of the commencement of the Offer Period).\n\u25cf\nTeam's market capitalisation as at the Latest Practicable Date was approximately \u00a3\n17.1\nmillion. Consequently, the Enlarged Group would have a market capitalisation of approximately \u00a3\n30.3\nmillion if the Acquisition had been completed as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\u25cf\nThe Acquisition is to be implemented by means of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement pursuant to Part 26 of the Act.\n\u25cf\nTeam\nhas received an irrevocable undertaking from each of Phillip Wale and John Cusins (as the WH Ireland Directors who hold WH Ireland Shares) (the\n\"WH Ireland Shareholder Directors\"\n) to vote (or procure the vote) in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the Special Resolution to be proposed at the WH Ireland General Meeting in respect of their beneficial interests in WH Ireland Shares and, in respect of Phillip Wale only, any beneficial interests he may acquire following the exercise of his options under the WH Ireland Share Schemes or otherwise amounting to, in aggregate, 4,104,600 WH Ireland Shares and representing, in aggregate, approximately 1.74 per cent. of the entire existing issued share capital of WH Ireland as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\u25cf\nThe Acquisition is further supported by WH Ireland Shareholders who have irrevocably undertaken to vote, or procure the vote, in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the Special Resolution to be proposed at the WH Ireland General Meeting, in connection with the implementation of the Acquisition, in respect of, in aggregate,\n140,109,552\nWH Ireland Shares, representing approximately\n59.37\nper cent. of the entire issued share capital of WH Ireland as at the Latest Practicable Date.\n\u25cf\nThe Acquisition is, therefore, supported by WH Ireland Shareholders (under irrevocable undertakings) interested, in aggregate, in\n144,214,152\nWH Ireland Shares, representing approximately\n61.11\nper cent. of the entire issued share capi",

Accordingly, each of Simon Moore and Garry Stran today notified the Board that they will resign as a director of the Company, with effect from 9 January 2026 (or earlier, by mutual agreement with the Board). Any change to this resignation date will be announced. The non-executive directors are fully committed to working with the Company to affect an orderly transition and handover in the coming months taking into account any views that might be expressed by any principal shareholders as part of their anticipated consultations.\n-END-\nFor further information please contact:\nWH Ireland Group plc\nwww.whirelandplc.com\nSimon Jackson, Chief F\ninance\nOfficer\n+44(0) 20 7220 1666\nZeus Capital Limited\nwww.zeuscapital.co.uk\nKaty Mitchell\n+44(0) 161 831 1512\nMHP Communications\nwhireland@mhpgroup.com\nReg Hoare / Hugo Harris\n+44 (0) 7831 406117\nNotes to Editors:\nAbout WH Ireland Group plc\nWealth Management Division\nWH Ireland provides independent financial planning advice and discretionary investment management.

Ireland Group Plc\n(\"WH Ireland\" or the \"Company\" and with its subsidiaries the \"Group\")\nConditional disposal of Wealth Management Business.\nProposed Cancellation of admission to AIM\nTrading Update\nNotice of General Meeting\nWH Ireland announces that its subsidiary WH Ireland Limited (\"\nWHIL\n\") has entered into a conditional asset purchase agreement (\"\nAPA\n\") with Oberon Investments Limited (\"\nOberon\n\") for the disposal of the business and assets of its wealth management business (the \"\nTransaction\n\") for consideration of \u00a31m, to be paid in cash at completion, plus the assumption of certain contractual liabilities by Oberon. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, as detailed below, it is anticipated that completion of the Transaction will occur on or around 31 October 2025 (\"\nCompletion\n\").\nSummary\n\u00b7\nSale of the Wealth Management Business\n\u00b7\nTotal Consideration of \u00a31m\n\u00b7\nProposed delisting of the Company's shares from trading on AIM and associated winddown\nBackground to the Transaction\nThe Transaction follows the disposal of the Company's Capital Markets division in July 2024 and reflects the Board's assessment of the future of the Wealth Management business and the continuing consolidation in the wealth management market. In that context, the Company has had strategic conversations with a number of potential counterparties. In some cases, these discussions have been prolonged and extensive and have led to advanced negotiations that have not come to fruition.\nDespite implementing further cost-saving measures, the Group's Wealth Management business continues to be loss-making and would require substantial investment to achieve sustainable profitability, but the Board believes that a further capital raise to fund such investment would be highly dilutive and difficult to execute in current circumstances. Against this backdrop, the Board believes that the Transaction with Oberon represents the best available outcome for stakeholders.\nThe Transaction constitutes a fundamental change of business under AIM Rule 15 and is therefore conditional upon shareholder approval at a general meeting of the Company. If approved, following the completion of the Transaction the Company will have divested all of its trading business and activities and will be regarded as an AIM Rule 15 cash shell. As such, technically the Company will be required to make an acquisition, or acquisitions, which constitutes a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14 (including seeking re-admission under the AIM Rules for Companies) within six months from the date of completion of the Transaction. However, given the Board's intention is to seek a delisting of the Company's shares from trading on AIM as part of this process, the Board is not considering making any such acquisition.\nCompletion of the Transaction is conditional upon (i) the passing of the resolution at the upcoming general meeting to approve the Transaction for the purposes of Rule 15 of the AIM Rules and (ii) WHIL's custodial services agreement with SEI Investments (Europe) Limited (\"\nSEI\n\") being novated to Oberon at Completion.\nIn the event that any of the conditions to the APA have not been satisfied or waived on or before 5.00 p.m. on 31 December 2025 (the \"\nLong Stop Date\n\"), the APA shall terminate and neither party shall have any obligation to the other, save in respect of any antecedent breach of the APA.\nIn addition, and w\nithout prejudice to any other remedies or accrued rights which it may have,\nOberon may terminate the APA at any time prior to Completion upon the occurrence of certain specified materially adverse events.\nEscrow Arrangements\nWHIL's current custodial services agreement with SEI in respect of custody and settlement services for clients will at Completion be novated to Oberon. Oberon will be liable to pay SEI's costs and charges for such time as SEI continues to provide its custodial services to Oberon under the novated custodial services agreement.\nUnless Oberon decides to keep using SEI's custodial services platform that custodial services agreement will be terminated and, in these circumstances, WHIL will indemnify Oberon in respect of the termination costs of that custodial services agreement for the remainder of its fixed term, currently running to February 2027 (or such earlier date as the parties might agree). By way of security for such contingent liability, WHIL will deposit the amount of \u00a3900,000 into an escrow account at Completion in support of its liability for such termination costs beyond a specified date. Where applicable, the excess amounts secured by the escrow amount would be released to WHIL. The exact amount that will",

According to a quick Google (so may be entirely wrong!) that should mean they have to make an offer to the other shareholders? Copied and pasted as follows: In the UK, public company takeovers are governed by the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \u201cTakeover Code\u201d), administered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. Here's a breakdown of the mandatory offer rules and minimum offer price requirements: \ud83d\udd39 Mandatory Offer Threshold (Rule 9 of the Takeover Code) A mandatory offer must be made when: A person (or group acting in concert) acquires shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights in a company subject to the Code. If a person already holds between 30% and 50%, any increase in their percentage of voting rights also triggers a mandatory offer. This rule ensures that control cannot be obtained without offering all shareholders the opportunity to exit at a fair price. [thetakeove...nel.org.uk] \ud83d\udd39 Minimum Offer Price (Rule 6 of the Takeover Code) The offer must be made at no less than the highest price paid by the bidder (or any concert party) for shares in the target company during the previous 12 months. This rule prevents a bidder from acquiring control at a premium and then offering a lower price to remaining shareholders.

At the current time the Group continues to be loss making but has sufficient liquidity and regulatory capital to be able to continue to operate on a \"business as usual\" basis. Board Changes Given the rejection of the Resolutions at the General Meeting, the non-executive directors have concluded that this effective vote of no confidence in the Board leaves them with no option but to tender their resignations. Accordingly, each of Simon Moore and Garry Stran today notified the Board that they will resign as a director of the Company, with effect from 9 January 2026 (or earlier, by mutual agreement with the Board). Any change to this resignation date will be announced. The non-executive directors are fully committed to working with the Company to affect an orderly transition and handover in the coming months taking into account any views that might be expressed by any principal shareholders as part of their anticipated consultations.",
