The Acquisition is to be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act (the \"\nScheme\n\").\nThe scheme document in relation to the Scheme, including the notices convening the Court Meeting and the WH Ireland General Meeting, together with the associated Forms of Proxy, in connection with the Acquisition was published, posted and made available to WH Ireland Shareholders on 10 December 2025 (the \"\nScheme Document\n\").\nCapitalised terms used in this announcement (the \"\nAnnouncement\n\") shall, unless otherwise defined, have the same meanings as set out in the Scheme Document.

The Court Meeting and WH Ireland General Meeting are to be held on 8 January 2026.\nIt is important that, for the Court Meeting in particular, as many votes as possible are cast, so that the Court may be satisfied that there is a fair representation of opinion of the Scheme Shareholders. WH Ireland Shareholders are therefore strongly urged to sign and return their Forms of Proxy or to appoint a proxy through the Sharegateway website or CREST for both the Court Meeting and the WH Ireland General Meeting as soon as possible. Doing so will not prevent WH Ireland Shareholders from attending and/or voting at the Meetings or any adjournment of either Meeting if they so wish and are so entitled.\nThe result of the votes at the Court Meeting and WH Ireland General Meeting will be announced by WH Ireland via a Regulatory Information Service as soon as practicable after the Court Meeting and WH Ireland General Meeting.\nEnquiries:\nTeam plc\nMark Clubb\n+ 44 (0) 1534 877210\nH&P Advisory Limited (financial adviser to Team)\nNeil Passmore / Vladimir Volodko\n+ 44 (0) 20 7907 8500\nStrand Hanson (nominated adviser to Team)\nRichard Johnson / James Spinney / David Asquith\n+ 44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nNovella Communications (financial PR to Team)\nTim Robertson / Safia Colebrook\n+44 (0) 20 3151 7008team@novella-comms.com\nW.H.
