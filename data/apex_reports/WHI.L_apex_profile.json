The scheme document in respect of the Acquisition was published and made available to WH Ireland Shareholders on 10 December 2025.\nMeeting Results\nThe Company is pleased to announce that at the Court Meeting and the General Meeting held earlier today:\n- the requisite majority of Scheme Shareholders voted (either in person or by proxy) in favour of the resolution to approve the Scheme at the Court Meeting; and\n- the requisite majority of WH Ireland Shareholders voted (either in person or by proxy) in favour of the Special Resolution, including approving the amendment of the WH Ireland Articles, at the General Meeting.\nDetails of the resolutions passed are set out in the notices of the Court Meeting and the General Meeting\nat Parts VIII and IX (respectively) of the Scheme Document.\nVoting results of the Court Meeting\nThe table below sets out the results of the poll at the Court Meeting held on 8 January 2026:\nFOR\nAGAINST\nTOTAL\nNumber of Scheme Shares voted\n158,600,155\n3,053\n158,603,208\nPercentage of Scheme Shares voted (1)\n99.998%\n0.002%\n100%\nNumber of Scheme Shareholders who voted (2)\n12\n3\n14(3)\nPercentage of Scheme Shareholders who voted (1) (2)\n85.71%\n21.43%\n100%(3)\nNumber of Scheme Shares voted as a percentage of the Scheme Shares eligible to be voted at the Court Meeting (1)\n67.2074%\n0.0013%\n67.2087%\n(1) Rounded to two decimal places\n(2) Where a Scheme Shareholder has cast some of their votes \"for\" and some of their votes\n\"against\" the resolution, such Scheme Shareholder has been counted as having voted both\n\"for\" and \"against\" the resolution for the purposes of determining the number and\npercentage of Scheme Shareholders who voted as set out in this row.\n(3) The aggregate of Scheme Shareholders voting \"for\" and \"against\" the resolution as set out in this row exceeds the total number and percentage of Scheme Shareholders who\nvoted because 1 registered member gave instructions for votes to be cast \"for\" the\nresolution in respect of part of their holding of Scheme Shares and \"against\" the resolution in respect of another part of their holding of Scheme Shares.\nVoting results of the General Meeting\nThe table below sets out the results of the poll at the General Meeting held on 8 January 2026:\nFOR\nAGAINST\nTOTAL\nWITHHELD\n(1)\nISC Voted\nSpecial Resolution\nNumber of votes\n% of votes\nNumber of votes\n% of votes\nNumber of votes\nNumber of votes\n%\nGranting authority to implement the Scheme and amendment to the WH Ireland Articles\n145,718,911\n99.998 %(2)\n2,803\n0.002 %(2)\n145,721,714\n623\n61.75%(2)\n(1) A vote withheld is not a vote in law and is not counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes \"for\" or \"against\" the Special Resolution.\n(2) Rounded to two decimal places\nThe total number of WH Ireland Shares in issue at the Voting Record Time was 235,986,209.

As announced by Team on 29 December 2025, Condition set out in paragraph 3(a) of Part A of Part III of the Scheme Document has also been satisfied. The Scheme remains subject to certain other Conditions, including: (i) the FCA Condition (as set out in Part III, Part A, paragraph 3(c) of the Scheme Document); (ii) the satisfaction (or, where applicable, waiver) of the remaining general Conditions set out in Part III of the Scheme Document; (iii) the Court sanctioning the Scheme; and (iv) the Court Order being duly delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\nExpected Timetable of Principal Events\nSubject to the satisfaction of the Conditions referred to in (i) and (ii) above, it is the current intention of the Company to seek the Court's sanction of the Scheme on or around 20 March 2026, at a hearing to be held in The Royal Courts of Justice and the Scheme is expected to become effective on or around 24 March 2026 (the \"\nEffective Date\n\").\nA request will be made to the London Stock Exchange prior to the Effective Date to cancel the trading in WH Ireland Shares on AIM with effect from 7.00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately following the Effective Date.\nIf all of these Conditions have not been, or are unlikely to be, satisfied before 20 March 2026, the expected timetable of principal events is likely to change and WH Ireland will make a further announcement regarding the expected timetable for the implementation of the Scheme.\nThe current expected timetable of the remaining principal events relating to the Scheme is set out in the Appendix to this announcement, on the assumption that the FCA Change of Control Condition is satisfied and the remaining Conditions (other than\nConditions 1, 2(c) and 2(d)\n) are satisfied or waived prior to 20 March 2026.\nA further announcement will be made by WH Ireland following satisfaction of the FCA Condition and the satisfaction (or, where applicable, waiver) of the remaining general Conditions set out in Part III of the Scheme Document.\nEnquiries:\nW.H.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s).
