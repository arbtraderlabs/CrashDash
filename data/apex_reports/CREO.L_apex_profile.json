The Directors believe the Company's technology can impact the landscape of surgery and endoscopy by providing a safer, less-invasive and more cost-efficient option for procedures.\nFor more information, please refer to the website\nwww.creomedical.com\nInterim results for six months ended 30 June 2025\nChief Executive Review\nIntroduction\nI am pleased to report continued strong progress for the first half of 2025 with revenues increasing by 40% to \u00a32.2m (\nH1-24: \u00a31.6m)\nfollowing wider clinical adoption of our\nproduct portfolio.\nWe have continued to implement efficiencies and cost reductions across the business, successfully reducing our underlying operating costs to \u00a39.1m (H1-24: 12.8m). These results also benefit from an exceptional gain of \u00a326.2m following the sale of our 51% interest in Creo Medical Europe (\"CME\"), resulting in a statutory profit before tax of \u00a316.1m.\nCommercial Update\nUnderpinning our revenue growth, as of 30 June 2025, we had\n232\nusers, up from 214 at the end of 2024, with increased utilisation per user being a key driver and focus. We continue to put our commercial efforts into generating growth through increased utilisation from our established user base, while working to widen adoption through training and active dissemination of case studies.\n(i) Speedboat & SpydrBlade\n- Resection products for colon cancers, oesophageal cancers and swallowing disorders\nResection products performed well in the first half and were the main drivers of our revenue growth. With growing adoption of our Speedboat range of products (Speedboat UltraSlim and Speedboat Notch), more clinical users are able to use our products to remove cancer and pre-cancer lesions from the colon and oesophagus, and in procedures to help correct a range of swallowing disorders via the upper\ngastrointestinal (\"GI\")\ntract, many of which have favourable reimbursement in major markets such as the USA.\nOur resection device portfolio has been bolstered by the introduction of SpydrBlade\u2122 Flex, a unique multi-modal endoscopic device designed for precision and adaptability in endoscopic procedures and suitable for upper and lower GI resections. In March 2025 we announced the UK and EU commercial launch of SpydrBlade\u2122 Flex, and its first use at St Mark's Hospital in London, one of the UK's leading Endoscopy Units. We received significant interest in the new technology at the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Days 2025 conference in Barcelona in April and have made good commercial progress in the UK and EU as we market the device alongside our Speedboat product range. Commercial ramp-up for this product has already begun in the US, following FDA clearance in June 2025, and we are confident that this will become an additional tool that will help move the point of care from surgery and the operating theatre to the endoscopy room.\nAs a Company based in Wales, we were pleased to announce in March 2025 that the first Welsh hospital to use Speedboat\n\u00ae\nfor colon cancer as part of a pilot led by the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. We expect that the hospital will, like other users, confirm that by utilising our Speedboat device, they can offer a more efficient, less invasive alternative to traditional surgical methods, improving patient outcomes and reducing waiting times.\nAs a case in point, before our products were available in NHS Wales, Liz Thomas, the wife of a former engineer who helped develop Speedboat, employed 'Patient Choice' to opt for an outpatient procedure using Speedboat in England, to remove a pre-cancerous lesion which avoided stitches, scarring, prolonged recovery, or post-operative long term health requirements.\u00a0Liz's testimonial video is available to view here:\nhttps://www.creomedical.com/en/patients/patient-case-stories\nGrowth in clinical adoption continues in the US. Long-term support for the roll-out of Creo's products\nhas come in the form of two newly announced Category I CPT reimbursement codes for upper GI and lower GI Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection procedures. We expect that\nthis financial incentive will encourage US clinicians to use next-generation products such as\nSpeedboat\u00ae UltraSlim\n,\nSpeedboat\u00ae Notch\nand\nSpydrBlade\n\u2122\n,\nwhich are specifically designed for such procedures. Further details on the reimbursement codes can be read in\nRNS Number : 3102K\n.\n(ii) MicroBlate\u2122 Flex and Fine\n- tumour ablation\nfor lung, pancreatic, liver, kidney and bladder cancers\nOur MicroBlate technology is\ndesigned to ablate nodules and tumours in several tissue types\nand is focused on treatments for lung, pancreatic, liver, kidney and bladder cancers.\nIn January, we announced the first clinical robotic-guided lung ablation cases using Intuitive's Ion Endoluminal System and Creo's MicroBlate\u2122 Flex ablation device to treat cancerous lung tissue outside of the initial clinical study at the Royal Brompton Hospital in the UK. We expect more sites to come online in 2025 using\nMicroBlate\u2122 Flex\nto treat lung tumours. Commercial sales of\nMicroBlate\u2122 Flex\nfrom the initial sites have already commenced, in-line with prior expectations that\neach site becomes revenue generating once the initial cases have been completed under the limited market release agreement\n.\nIn July, we announced the\u00a0first patient treated in a new post-market multi-centre \"ablate and resect\" clinical study evaluating the safety and performance of\nMicroBlate\u2122 Flex\nfor the treatment of lung tumours. This study is\ntaking place at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre in the Netherlands and at the Royal Brompton Hospital in the UK.\nThese studies\u00a0will provide a substantial and robust clinical dataset ahead of full commercialisation.\n(iii) Supportive Clinical Data\nWider clinical adoption of Creo's\nproduct portfolio\ncontinues to be supported by a significant number of clinical evidence papers, abstracts and case studies from clinicians and investigators around the world who have used Creo's advanced energy devices, with many being presented at major international meetings such as DDW (USA), ESGE (EU), and JGES (Japan). Examples can be viewed here:\nwww.creomedical.com/en/investors/creo-medical-clinical-resources-bibliography\nWe will continue to update shareholders as further data is published that supports the commercial adoption of our technology.\nOperational Update -\nimproved operating efficiency\nH1-25 benefits from the full impact of actions we undertook in 2024 and in the first half of the year we continued to implement efficiencies and cost reductions which will come through in H2 and beyond. Underlying operating costs on a continuing basis have reduced by 24% to \u00a3\n9.1\nm (H1-24: \u00a3\n12.8\nm); as a result underlying operating loss on a continuing basis has reduced to \u00a36.8m (H1-24: \u00a312.0m).\nDuring the period we completed\nthe sale of 51% of the issued share capital of CME to Micro Tech\nresulting in an exceptional gain of \u00a326.2m with the net cash proceeds\nfrom the sale being used to strengthen the Group's balance sheet. In addition, the strategic transaction with Micro-Tech strengthens our commercial platform, expands our endoscopic therapy product range in all markets, and gives us access to\u00a0Micro-Tech's specialised global distribution and manufacturing expertise.\nWhilst our 49% stake in CME is held on the balance sheet at a value of \u20ac36m (\u00a329.5m), we also expect this asset to bring in income and cash inflows via annual dividends. Current trading at CME is above its management expectations for growth at both revenue and EBITDA levels.\nBoard Changes\nA number of Board changes took place during the period to ensure the Board was appropriately structured to match recommended best practice and to create a non-executive majority. David Woods and Chris Hancock did not stand for re-election at the 2025 AGM. Whilst they stood down from their Board positions, they continue their day-to-day functions and are\nsenior contributors to Creo's operational Board. John Bradshaw, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, also stood down from the Board in line with his planned retirement from the role having served as a Non-Executive Director since IPO in 2016. The Board wishes to thank them for their significant contributions.\nOutlook\nCurrent trading in the second half continues to develop in line with management expectations and we expect to deliver another strong year of growth. H2 is traditionally stronger than H1, and we remain confident that this supports our guidance of delivering 40% to 60% revenue growth for the full year.\nWith continued growth, improved operational efficiencies and cost reductions the Board remains confident in the Company's ability to deliver self-sustaining cashflows and increased value to shareholders.\nWe remain committed to\ntransforming and improving the lives\nof pre-cancer and cancer patients worldwide.\nOn behalf of the Board, I thank Creo's shareholders for their continued support, feedback, and encouragement along with all members of the Creo team, our clinicians and their patients, our customers, suppliers, and other partners for all their hard work, support, and positive contributions during the period.\nCraig Gulliford\nChief Executive Officer\n22 September 2025\nFinancial Review\nTotal sales for the period were \u00a35.0m (H1-24: \u00a315.2m), with revenue from continuing operations being \u00a32.2m (H1-24: \u00a31.6m), an increase of 40% from H1-2024\nunderpinned by wider clinical adoption of our products\n.\nIn September 2024, the Group announced the agreement to sell a 51% interest in CME to Micro-Tech with net proceeds of \u20ac30m payable in cash on completion (the \"Sale\"). The Sale completed on 12\u00a0February 2025, with cash proceeds received on 14\u00a0February 2025. Prior to the end of 2024 we also reached heads of terms to sell Aber, a Creo subsidiary, as part of a Management Buy Out. This was held as an asset held for sale at 31\u00a0December 2024 and the transaction was completed in March\u00a02025.\nConsumable sales of \u00a32.8m (H1-24: \u00a313.6m) from discontinued operations represents the sales up to 12 February 2025.\n6 months to\n6 months to\n12 months to\n(All figures \u00a3m)\n30-Jun-25\nUnaudited\n30-Jun-24\nUnaudited\n31-December-24\nAudited\nCreo Products\n2.2\n1.6\n4.0\nContinuing operations\n2.2\n1.6\n4.0\nCreo Consumables\n2.8\n13.6\n26.7\nDiscontinued operations\n2.8\n13.6\n26.7\nTotal\n5.0\n15.2\n30.7\nTotal gross profit for continuing operations in the period increased to \u00a31.0m (H1-24: \u00a30.8m). This represents an increase in the gross margin to 47.0% (H1-24: 43.8%) reflecting an increase in sales and volume related benefits. As the business matures it is expected that gross margins will continue to improve.\nUnderlying EBITDA loss (EBITDA with R&D tax credits and other accounting adjustments added back) on a continuing basis was \u00a37.2m, representing a 42% decrease (H1-24: \u00a312.5m). This \u00a35.3m decrease reflects \u00a30.3m from higher margins, \u00a34.5m from reduced operating costs following the restructuring completed in 2024, and a \u00a31.2m contribution from the 49% holding in CME partially offset by a \u00a30.4m reduction in R&D tax credits due to lower R&D spend.\nAs noted in the 2024 annual report, we initiated a raft of cost saving plans during the latter part of 2024. This process reduced our cost base by more than \u00a35m on an annualised basis going into 2025. These savings are in addition to the reduction in the cost base that has arisen from the sale of CME and Aber. Underlying administrative expenses (administrative expenses less SIP charge, share based payments, earnout, depreciation, amortisation and settlements) on a continuing basis decreased in the period to \u00a39.1m (H1-24: \u00a312.8).\nStrict cost controls have remained during the period particularly around headcount, travel and general overheads with further savings expected during H2-25. These operational changes underpin our drive towards our goal of achieving self-sustaining cashflows.\nThe underlying operating loss on a continuing basis for the period is \u00a36.8m (H1-24: \u00a312.0m) representing a 43% decrease This is a non-statutory measure which adjusts the operating loss as follows:\nFinancial Review\n6 months to\n6 months to\n12 months to\n(All figures \u00a3'000)\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 December 2024\nRevenue\n2.2\n1.6\n4.0\nCost of Sales\n(1.2)\n(0.8)\n(2.1)\nGross Profit\n1.0\n0.8\n1.9\n47.0%\n43.8%\n47.5%\nOther Operating Income\n0.0\n0.0\n(0.4)\nAdministrative Expenses\n(11.0)\n(15.6)\n(30.3)\nProfit from sale of subsidiary\n26.2\n-\n-\nOperating Profit / (Loss)\n16.2\n(14.8)\n(28.8)\nSIP Charge\n0.1\n0.1\n0.3\nPPE & Other Settlement\n0.0\n-\n-\nRedundancy costs\n0.1\n-\n1.1\nGrant Income\n-\n-\n0.4\nEarnout\n-\n0.1\n-\nDepreciation & Amortisation\n0.6\n0.9\n1.5\nR&D expenditure recovered via tax credit scheme\n0.8\n1.2\n2.0\nShare of NCI of associate\n1.2\n-\n-\nProfit from sale of subsidiary\n(26.2)\n-\n-\nUnderlying EBITDA (non-statutory measure)\n(7.2)\n(12.5)\n(23.5)\nShare based payments (inc.

The underlying EBITDA excludes SIP charges and Earnout charges (contingent and deferred payments on previous acquisitions), individual items outside of business control, expenses which are non-cash and incorporates the recovery of research and development expenditure which the Group is able to benefit from through R&D tax credit schemes. The underlying operating loss position is EBITDA excluding share-based payment expenses which are non-cash.\nSale of Creo Medical Europe\nIn addition to the consideration received from the Sale, the remaining 49% stake held in CME will bring income via a share of the annual profits of CME and cash inflows via annual dividends distributed from any annual profits going forwards. A \u00a31.2m (H1-24: \u00a3nil) share of profit was recognised during the period.\nCurrent trading at CME continues to be above its management expectations for growth at both revenue and EBITDA levels.\nOn completion of the Sale, a \u20ac36m (\u00a329.5m) investment asset was recognised and held on the balance sheet, providing future balance sheet strength to the Group. As a result of the sale, this period\nbenefited from an exceptional gain of \u00a326.2m.\nTax\nThe Company has not recognised any additional deferred tax assets in respect of trading losses arising in the current financial period. The Company recognises tax assets in respect of claims under the UK research and development Small or Medium-sized Enterprise (\"SME\") scheme, accrued in line with costs with any adjustments being made on submission of a claim. We received \u00a32.0m cash from R&D tax credits in August 2025.\nEarnings per share\nProfit per share was 4 pence for the period (six-months to 30 June 2024: loss of 3 pence).\nCash flow and Balance Sheet\nNet cashflow generated from operating activities was \u00a315.3m for the six months to 30 June 2025 (H1-24: \u00a313.7m decrease). This included \u00a324.9m net proceeds from the sale of CME (see Note 5). Net cash outflow excluding this exceptional item was \u00a39.9m. The decrease from the previous period was due to the reduction in operating expenses following the restructuring completed in late 2024.\nNet cash from financing activities was \u00a30.6m (H1-24: \u00a35.5m generated) reflecting loan and lease repayments during the period. H1-24 included \u00a36.2m of new loans acquired in Europe which were repaid on completion of the sale of CME.\nTotal assets at 30 June 2025 were \u00a368.8m (H1-24: \u00a369.3m). Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2025 were \u00a320.5m (30 June 2023: \u00a39.8m). At 30 June 2025, the debtor position in relation to R&D Tax Credits was \u00a32.9m including the \u00a32.0m debtor from December 2024 which was received in August 2025.\nWith the completion of Creo's suite of advanced energy products, allowing the business to move into a more streamlined and simplified commercial organisation, the Company has agreed heads of terms to divest part of its Chepstow site. Once complete, the divestment will provide additional non-dilutive cash for the business' day-to-day operations. This is held as an asset held for sale as at 30 June 2025 of \u00a31.7m.\nWe continue to make progress in the divestment and will provide a further update in due course.\n2025 Outlook\nTrading in the first half of 2025 met management's expectations, including a notable increase in revenue and number of regular users of Creo's Speedboat device, and remains on the trajectory to meet management's aims for the Company for the full year. We anticipate continued revenue growth and expect to maintain a strong gross margin across our product range during H2-25, and we re-iterate prior guidance of revenue growth of 40-60% for FY25. Active cost control will support a stable cost base, driving efficiencies through the business.\nRichard Rees\nChief Financial Officer\n22 September 2025\nConsolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income\n6 months to\n6 months to\n12 months to\n(All figures \u00a3m)\nNote\n30 June 2025\nUnaudited\nRestated*\n30 June 2024\nUnaudited\n31 December 2024\nAudited\nRevenue\n2\n2.2\n1.6\n4.0\nCost of sales\n(1.2)\n(0.8)\n(2.1)\nGross Profit\n1.0\n0.8\n1.9\nOther operating income\n0.0\n0.0\n(0.4)\nAdministrative expenses\n(11.0)\n(15.6)\n(30.3)\nProfit on sale of subsidiary\n5\n26.2\n-\n-\nOperating Profit/(loss)\n16.2\n(14.8)\n(28.8)\nFinance expenses\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.4)\nFinance income\n0.3\n0.1\n0.2\n(Loss)/Gain on foreign exchange\n(0.3)\n0.0\n0.0\nProfit/(Loss) before tax\n16.1\n(14.8)\n(29.0)\nTaxation\n0.8\n1.3\n1.2\nProfit/(Loss) for the year\n16.9\n(13.5)\n(27.8)\nDiscontinued Operations\n6\n0.0\n1.2\n(0.9)\nProfit/(Loss) for the period/year\n16.9\n(12.3)\n(28.7)\nExchange loss on foreign subsidiary\n-\n(0.7)\n(1.3)\nShare of NCI of associate\n7\n1.2\n-\n-\nTotal other comprehensive income\n1.2\n(0.7)\n(1.3)\nTotal comprehensive profit/(loss) for the year\n18.1\n(13.0)\n(30.0)\nProfit/(Loss) per Share\nBasic (\u00a3)\n3\n0.04\n(0.03)\n(0.08)\nDiluted (\u00a3)\n3\n0.04\n(0.03)\n(0.08)\n*2024 H1 result has been restated following the completion of the sale of 51% of the issued share capital of Creo Medical S.L.U (\"Creo Medical Europe\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Creo, to Micro-tech (NL) International B.V, a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro-Tech (Nanjing) Co.

Basis of preparation\nThe interim financial report for the period ended 30 June 2025 and similarly the period ended 30 June 2024 has been neither audited nor reviewed by the auditor.\n2024 H1 result has been restated following the completion of the sale of 51% of the issued share capital of Creo Medical S.L.U (\"Creo Medical Europe\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Creo, to Micro-tech (NL) International B.V, a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro-Tech (Nanjing) Co.Ltd (SHA: 688029) on February 12th 2025. The interim financial report for the period ended 30 June 2025 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024 has been based on information in the audited financial statements for that period. A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies, the accounts had an unqualified audit opinion and did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nThis interim financial report for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025 (including comparatives for the six months ended 30 June 2024) was approved by the Board of Directors on 21 September 2025.\nGoing Concern\nThe interim review statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons:\nThe Directors have considered the applicability of the going concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements. This included the review of financial results, internal budgets, cash flow forecasts and covenant compliance for the period of at least 12-months following the date of approval of the financial statements (\"the going concern period\").\nThe Directors continue to monitor and adjust a base case scenario which is based on the Board approved forecast and assumes an increase in revenues, and a decrease in underlying administrative expenses following a strategic review of the underlying cost base. In addition, the Directors have modelled severe but plausible downside scenarios on the going concern period. These scenarios include sensitivity analysis to delay future revenue growth. In such a case the Group would take mitigating actions and the Directors concluded that the Group would be able to reduce expenditure on its research and development programmes and other areas in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the going concern period, without needing to obtain waivers on any applicable debt covenants.\nBased on the above, the Directors are satisfied that the Group and Company will have sufficient funds to meet their liabilities as they fall due for the going concern period and therefore have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nAccounting policies\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 are in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK adopted international accounting standards and are consistent with those which will be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2025. Whilst the financial information included has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of international accounting standards, the financial information does not contain sufficient information to comply with international accounting standards. The Group has not applied IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, which is not mandatory for UK AIM listed Groups, in the preparation of this interim financial report.\nChanges in accounting policy and disclosures\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations\nThe following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2025:\n-\nLack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21). The amendment clarifies how the Group assesses whether a currency is exchangeable, and when not, how to derive and disclose an appropriate exchange rate. Additional disclosures are required regarding the estimation methodology and the resulting financial impact.\nThe adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\nFuture standards, amendments and interpretations:\nIn April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, which replaces IAS 1. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 (with earlier adoption permitted) and must be applied retrospectively. IFRS 18 will change how the Group presents its financial statements but will not affect the recognition or measurement of assets, liabilities, income, or expenses. The group is in the process of assessing the impact and changes required to meet this new standard.\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nThe principal risks and uncertainties impacting the Group are described in our 2024 Annual Report and remain unchanged at 30 June 2025. We continue to monitor the global inflationary and economic pressures along with other geopolitical macro issues.\nCritical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe Group is required to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. These estimates and judgements are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. Accounting estimates and judgements have been required for the production of these Financial Statements.\nShare-based payments\nEquity-settled share options are granted to certain officers and employees. Each tranche in an award is considered a separate award with its own vesting period and grant date fair value. The fair value of each tranche is measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Monte Carlo method, or a hybrid model where appropriate. Compensation expense is recognised over the tranche's vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest, through an increase to equity. The number of awards expected to vest is reviewed over the vesting period, with any forfeitures recognised immediately.\nResearch and development costs\nCapitalisation of development costs requires analysis of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project concerned. Capitalisation of the costs will only be made where there is evidence that an economic benefit will flow to the Company. During the period we capitalised \u00a3290k of research and development costs in relation to our bipolar snare product which we are developing. No other development costs have been capitalized for the period.\nDeferred tax assets\nManagement judgement is required on whether the Group should recognise any deferred tax assets for losses. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.\nGiven the nature and stage of development of Creo Medical Limited there are significant losses accumulated to date. To determine whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised in relation to the future tax deduction that these losses represent, the Directors have considered the estimated profits over a medium to long-term forecast and the events required to achieve such forecasts.\nForecasts for Creo Medical Limited continue to show tax losses for at least the medium term (to three years) as the Group continues to develop and commercialise its products. Given the extent of uncertainty with forecasting over a longer-term horizon, it is determined that there is not the level of convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which further tax losses or tax credits can be utilised. Thus, there is insufficient certainty over the timing and amount of loss recoverability for any further deferred tax asset to be recognised.\nSegmental reporting\nAn entity is required to disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which it engages and the economic environments in which it operates. As the Group's global reach has expanded in the period, management have exercised significant judgement in determining whether presenting segment information on an alternative basis would better adhere to this core principle.\nWhilst the operations in different geographical locations form a fundamental part of the Group's long-term strategy, they are in the early stages of development, and the Group continues to focus on the development and commercialisation of its products and the key range of unique endoscopic surgical devices and CROMA Advanced Energy Platform. In making their judgement, the directors considered the Group's activities and the internal reporting structures, and information regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision-maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing performance.\nAfter the assessment, the directors concluded that financial information at a consolidated Group level appropriately reflects the business activities in which the Group is currently engaged, and the economic environment in which it operates. As explained in the 2024 Annual Report, as the Group continues to grow it is expected that the internal reporting structure will evolve in order to meet the changing activities, goals and objectives of the business and therefore additional operating segments may be identified as appropriate in future reporting periods.\nInvestment in Associate\nInvestments in Associates with significant influence but not control will be accounted for under the equity method as per IAS 28. The investment will be recognised initially at cost, with share of the profits added to the investment and the investment reduced by subsequent dividends. The investment must be assessed for impairment indicators.\nFollowing the disposal of CME the group now holds a 49% interest in Creo Medical S.L. over which it exercises significant influence but does not have control or joint control. The asset has been recognised initially at \u00a329.5m, being 49% of the \u20ac72m equity value of the purchase by Micro-Tech. As required under the equity method as per IAS 28.\nSubsequently, the share of the associates' profits for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025 of \u00a31.2m has been recognised on the investment. Total investment \u00a330.7m (2024: nil), with the remaining investment on the balance sheet \u00a32.1m in IQ Endoscopes Ltd.\nAsset Held for sale\nAny non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro-rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, investment property or biological assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale or held for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n2. Revenue and other operating income\nThe revenue split for the Group at 30 June 2025 was as follows:\n6 months to\n6 months to\n12 months to\n(All figures \u00a3m)\n30-Jun-25\nUnaudited\n30-Jun-24\nUnaudited\n31-December-24\nAudited\nUK\n1.0\n0.9\n1.7\nEurope\n0.3\n0.3\n1.2\nRoW\n0.9\n0.4\n1.1\nContinuing operations\n2.2\n1.6\n4.0\nUK\n0.7\n6.3\n7.2\nEurope\n2.1\n7.3\n19.5\nRoW\n-\n-\n-\nDiscontinued operations\n2.8\n13.6\n26.7\nTotal\n5.0\n15.2\n30.7\n6 months to\n6 months to\n12 months to\n(All figures \u00a3m)\n30-Jun-25\nUnaudited\n30-Jun-24\nUnaudited\n31-December-24\nAudited\nCreo Products\n2.2\n1.6\n4.0\nContinuing operations\n2.2\n1.6\n4.0\nCreo Consumables\n2.8\n13.6\n26.7\nDiscontinued operations\n2.8\n13.6\n26.7\nTotal\n5.0\n15.2\n30.7\n3.

In comparative years, the potential ordinary shares are considered to be antidilutive on the basis that they reduce the loss per share and are not included in the Company's EPS calculation, meaning that diluted EPS is the same as basic EPS.\n4.

Disposal of investments in subsidiaries\nOn 12 February 2025 Creo announced the completion of the sale of 51% of the issued share capital of Creo Medical S.L.U. (\"CME\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Creo, to Micro-Tech (NL) International B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro-Tech (Nanjing) Co. Ltd (SHA: 688029) (\"Micro-Tech\") at an equivalent equity value of \u20ac72m on a cash-free, debt-free basis. Along with other customary conditions, completion of the Sale was contingent on Micro-Tech obtaining Outbound Direct Investment clearance in China along with Foreign Direct Investment clearances in Spain, France, Belgium and Germany which were obtained. After the settling of debt of \u20ac6.3m, net proceeds of \u20ac30.4m were received by the Company on 14 February 2025. Creo are holding an associate investment using equity accounting at the fair value of the retained investment.\nOn 19 March 2025 Aber Electronics Limited (\"Aber\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Creo Medical Limited, was sold by Creo Medical Limited to its management. Creo Medical Limited acquired Aber on 11 November 2021 as a step to secure the supply of a component in the CROMA advanced energy platform. The transaction releases Creo from any ongoing obligations under the original SPA including any further earn out payments. The transaction also includes anti-embarrassment terms which apply until the 10th anniversary of the transaction and the repayment of all intercompany balances, pursuant to which Creo would receive up to 20% of the net proceeds of a sale if Aber (or its business and assets) were acquired by a third party.\nThe impact of both transactions can be seen both on the statement of comprehensive income and the reduction in the statement of financial position. The resulting transaction resulted in a profit on disposal of \u00a326.2m this is broken down as follows:\n6 months to\n(All figures \u00a3m)\n30 June 2025\nConsideration received\n30.7\nDebt settled\n(5.8)\nNet consideration\n24.9\nCarrying amount of net assets disposed\n(26.8)\nTransaction costs incurred on disposal\n(1.4)\nInvestment Retained\n29.5\nProfit on disposal\n26.2\nHeld For sale\nMovement in\nAsset\n(All figures \u00a3m)\n31 December 2024\nAsset to sale date\nDisposed\nNon-current assets\n24.6\n-\n24.6\nCurrent assets\n16.3\n0.2\n16.5\nTotal assets held for sale\n40.9\n0.2\n41.1\nTotal liabilities held for sale\n14.2\n0.1\n14.3\nNet Asset Held for Sale\n26.7\n0.1\n26.8\nThe Investment retained on the balance represents the 49% associate accounted for under IAS 28 equity method. The disposal removed the requirement for the foreign currency reserve, which has been transferred to reserves. The movement in the asset held for sale reflects the result of discontinued operations adjusted for relevant continuing profits affecting the asset disposed of with \u00a30.1m impact.\n6. Asset held for sale\nOn the 26 May 2025 the board approved the sale of a non-current asset in relation to property at the Chepstow site, as such it was deemed to meet the conditions outlined in IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale. The property is held on the balance sheet at its carrying value of \u00a31.7m, no impairment has been recognised given the fair value less cost to sell is in excess of its carrying value. There is no associated operation and therefore no requirement for discontinued operations.\n7.

Opting to seek private treatment in England outside of the NHS, Liz was able to benefit from an outpatient\u00a0Speedboat\u00ae procedure and, as with so many other patients in England through the NHS, avoided the removal of her bowel and associated\u00a0major surgery.\u00a0She\u00a0has\u00a0made a successful recovery and returned to\u00a0daily life\u00a0within days of the procedure, underscoring the real-world impact of Speedboat\u00ae\u00a0on quality of life.\nSpeedboat\u00ae\u00a0continues to provide significant clinical value\u00a0to a rapidly increasing number of patients in the treatment of the early stages of colorectal cancer avoiding complex and impactful surgery. In this, a typical speedboat case, a 5cm pre-cancerous lesion was removed without stitches, scarring, prolonged recovery, or post-operative long term health requirements. This case, and the extensive data from many other cases undertaken worldwide, demonstrates the ability of Speedboat\u00ae to reduce surgical burden, shorten hospital stays, and improve patient outcomes.\nThe testimonial also highlights the significance of Aneurin Bevan University Health becoming the first Health Board in Wales to pilot Creo's Speedboat\u00ae technology, as announced\nin February 2025\n. The pilot is already proving successful with patients in Wales already treated since the procedure was made available in early 2025. The Company believes the successful conclusion of the pilot, and supporting data, will drive further adoption across other health boards in Wales, paving the way for wider NHS rollout and supporting Creo's commercial growth strategy.\nAs adoption continues to grow across the UK and globally, Liz's experience highlights the profound human impact of Creo's mission: transforming lives, one procedure at a time.\nThe video interview can be found here:\nhttps://www.creomedical.com/en/patients/patient-case-stories\nFor further information please contact:\nCreo Medical Group plc\nwww.creomedical.com\nRichard Craven, Company Secretary\nVia Walbrook PR\nDeutsche Numis (Nominated Adviser, sole Broker and Financial Adviser)\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Sher Shah\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\ncreo@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 /\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Creo Medical\nCreo Medical is a medical device company focused on the development and commercialisation of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, bringing advanced energy to endoscopy.\nThe Company's vision is to improve patient outcomes through the development and commercialisation of a suite of electrosurgical medical devices, each enabled by CROMA, powered by Kamaptive.

WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nCreo Medical Group plc\n(\"Creo\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nH1'25 Trading Update\n40% Core Technology revenue growth, in line with management expectations\nTracking on plan with full year guidance\nCreo Medical Group plc (AIM: CREO), the medical device company focused on the emerging field of minimally invasive surgical endoscopy for pre-cancer and cancer patients, provides\na trading update for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025 (H1'25).\nFinancial highlights\nH1'25 Core Technology revenues from continuing operations were up 40% to \u00a32.2m (H1'24: \u00a31.6m), in line\nwith management expectations for first half performance.\nThe Board is pleased with current trading\ninto the second half of the financial year\nand believes the Company\nis tracking on plan for 40% to 60% revenue growth for the full year, in-line with prior guidance, with\na continued historical H2 weighting.\nCreo has continued to implement efficiencies and cost reductions, and H1'25 has benefitted from the full impact of the proactive management of its cost base already undertaken in 2024. Underlying operating costs on a continuing basis have reduced to \u00a3\n9.1\nm (H1'24: \u00a3\n12.8\nm). Underlying operating loss on a continuing basis has reduced to \u00a36.9m (H1'24: \u00a312.1m).\nCash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2025 was \u00a3\n20.5\nm (31 December 2024: \u00a38.7m).\nOperational overview\nRecent developments in the US have provided positive support for the long-term roll-out of Creo's products\n. The two new Category I CPT reimbursement codes for upper gastrointestinal (\"GI\") and lower GI Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection procedures are expected to\nenable and encourage the use of next-generation products such as\nSpeedboat\u00ae UltraSlim\n, and\nSpeedboat\u00ae Notch\n, designed specifically for such procedures. The Board believes this financial incentive will encourage the US market to move from diagnostic procedures to therapeutic procedures in upper and lower GI.\nIn other positive news for commercial traction in the US, in June 2025, the Company announced\nFDA clearance for its\nSpydrBlade\u2122 Flex\ndevice,\na unique multi-modal endoscopic device designed for precision and adaptability in therapeutic endoscopy procedures\na\nnd the latest product in Creo's GI suite of advanced energy products\n.\nAs set out in the full year results, the Company expects more sites to come online in 2025 using\nMicroBlate\u2122 Flex\nin the treatment of lung tumours, with the expectation that these sites will become revenue generative in due course. Commercial sales of\nMicroBlate\u2122 Flex\nfrom the initial sites have already commenced. Earlier this month the Company announced first patient treatment in a post-market multi-centre \"ablate and resect\" clinical study to evaluate\nMicroBlate\u2122 Flex\nsafety and performance. The study is\ntaking place at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre in the Netherlands and at the Royal Brompton Hospital in the UK.\nWider clinical adoption of Creo's\nCore Technology portfolio\ncontinues to be supported by a significant number of papers, abstracts and case studies from clinicians around the world who have used Creo's advanced energy devices. Many can be viewed here:\nhttps://www.creomedical.com/en/investors/creo-medical-clinical-resources-bibliography\nAs detailed in the full year results, in September 2024, the Group announced the agreement to sell a 51% interest in Creo Medical Europe (\"CME\") to Micro-Tech (NL) International B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro-Tech (Nanjing) Co. Ltd (SHA: 688029) (the \"Sale\"). The Sale completed on 12 February 2025.\nThe Company's 49% stake in CME will bring revenue and cash inflows via annual dividends distributed from annual profits going forwards. Current trading at CME is reported to be above its management expectations for growth at both revenue and EBITDA levels. We are now working actively with Micro-Tech to explore strategic growth opportunities both within CME and Creo's wider advanced energy portfolio.\nOn completion of the Sale, a \u20ac36m investment asset was recognised and held on the balance sheet, providing future balance sheet strength to the Group. This will be an exceptional gain during H1'25.\nWith the completion of Creo's suite of advanced energy products allowing the business to move into a more streamlined and simplified commercial organisation, the Company has agreed heads of terms to divest part of its Chepstow site for \u00a31.75m. Once complete, the divestment will provide additional non-dilutive cash for the business's day-to-day operations.\nOutlook\nThe Board of Creo remains confident in the outlook for 2025 and expects another year of strong",

Once surgically removed, the tumour is analysed to assess device performance against the patient's pre and post-procedural scans, a vital performance measure only achievable from this study design. The Study is taking place at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre in the Netherlands and at the Royal Brompton Hospital in the UK.\nFull details of the Study can be found here:\nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06689488\nThe Study complements Creo's previously announced post-market study designed to gather immediate safety and longer-term follow-up clinical data. These studies, in conjunction with the post-market programme underway with Intuitive which delivers robotically-guided lung tumour ablation using Creo's\nMicroBlate\u2122 Flex\nalongside Intuitive's Ion endoluminal system\n,\nwill provide a substantial and robust clinical dataset ahead of commercialisation.\nAbout\nMicroBlate\u2122\u00a0Flex\nMicroBlate\n\u2122\nFlex\nis a soft tissue ablation device, designed to ablate nodules and tumours in several tissue types.

Crofton, Non-Executive Chairman\n, will say:\n\"I am very pleased with the strong progress we've made over the last year. As a Board we undertook a major business plan review and focussed on reducing costs and growing revenue from our Core Technology. I acknowledge that we still have more to do, but we are confident that Creo is\nwell positioned for accelerated growth.\n\"As part of our ongoing succession planning and commitment to a strong, streamlined, and independent governance structure, we announced a sequence of planned Board changes. In May, we confirmed the retirement of John Bradshaw, Creo's Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit Committee. With this, Ivonne Cantu, Non-Executive Director, has stepped in as Interim Audit Committee Chair while we progress the search for a permanent successor. In our FY24 results, we also announced that David Woods (Chief Commercial Officer) and Christopher Hancock (Chief Technology Officer), whilst continuing their vital executive roles within Creo, would not stand for re-election to the plc Board at this year's AGM. As such, they will step down from the Company's board as of today.\n\"This planned Board evolution, initiated in 2024 and continuing into 2025, reflects a deliberate strategy to strengthen commercial leadership and enhance governance. It results in a more streamlined Board with a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors - aligning with best practice and supporting Creo's next phase of growth.\n\"It has been a pleasure to work with the Board throughout this process. In particular, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to John Bradshaw for his long-standing contribution to Creo since its earliest days, and for his ongoing support during the transition to a new Audit Committee Chair.\n\"As we confirmed last month, 2025 started positively with strong performance in Q1 for our Core Technology products. With the commercial launch of Speedboat UltraSlim, SpydrBlade Flex and Speedboat Notch, we expect to see increasing utilisation of our CROMA platform and related devices. Our Kamaptive partnership with Intuitive continues to progress well. We expect more sites will come online for the use of MicroBlate Flex shortly, and we will see these sites all move into revenue generation once the initial post market clinical data collection is completed.\n\"Earlier this month we were able to confirm the receipt of FDA clearance for our SpydrBlade Flex\ndevice,\nthe latest addition to\nour suite of advanced energy products that can be used in Gastro-Intestinal endoscopic procedures. SpydrBlade Flex, along with our Speedboat products are all used in\nEndoscopic Submucosal Dissection (\"ESD\"), a procedure used to treat early-stage cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions in the GI tract. Recent news in the US confirming reimbursement codes for ESD procedures is very encouraging for the long-term success of our commercial roll-out of these products in the U.S. market.\n\"I am pleased to see that our focus on the continued transformation of the Company is delivering further improvements across the Group. We remain confident that we will see another year of strong growth in our Core Technology from both existing and new users, and that we remain on track to deliver against our goals of achieving self-sustaining cashflows and improving lives.\n\"It has been my pleasure to chair the Board since joining in July 2024, and I look forward into the remainder of 2025 and beyond with great optimism. I thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support.\"\nDirectorate Change\nFurther to the Group's announcement on 19 May 2025, David Woods (Chief Commercial Officer) and Christopher Hancock (Chief Technology Officer) have stepped off the Company's Board, effective today. Both will remain as executive employees of the Group.\nFor further information please contact:\nCreo Medical Group plc\nwww.creomedical.com\nRichard Craven, Company Secretary\nVia Walbrook PR\nDeutsche Numis (Nominated Adviser, sole Broker and Financial Adviser)\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Sher Shah\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\ncreo@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 /\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Creo Medical\nCreo is a medical device company focused on the development and commercialisation of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, bringing advanced energy to endoscopy.\nThe Company's vision is to impr",

Following the commercial launch of the product in Europe (\nannounced on 20 March 2025\n), the list of established clinical use-cases is growing and already includes Z-POEMs, pedunculated polyps, general dissections and difficult-to-treat fibrotic cases, demonstrating the versatility of the product. Simple to use, SpydrBlade\u2122 Flex is designed for rapid clinical adoption.\nFDA clearance allows Creo to initiate the launch of\nSpydrBlade\u2122 Flex\nin the U.S. market. The existing direct sales force, alongside its established network of key opinion leaders and clinicians, allows for rapid adoption of SpydrBlade\u2122 Flex in the critical US market.\nMany of the use-cases for SpydrBlade\n\u2122 Flex fall under existing reimbursement codes and indications covered by the recent decision by the American Medical Association\n(announced on 28 May 2025\n) to establish reimbursement codes for endoscopic submucosal dissection. This provides a clear reimbursement framework for current and future U.S. healthcare providers which\nwill encourage the adoption of next-generation products such as Creo's\nSpydrBlade\n\u2122 Flex\nalong with the rest of Creo's advanced energy GI product range;\nSpeedboat\u00ae UltraSlim\n, and\nSpeedboat\u00ae\nNotch\nand\nMicroBlate\n\u00ae\nFine\n.\nImages:\nSpydrBlade\u2122 Flex\nCommenting, Craig Gulliford, Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\"This is an important commercial milestone for Creo as we have now received FDA clearance for our full suite of advanced energy GI products for resection, dissection and ablation. This product has tested us with some of our most difficult design challenges, the novelty of which and the associated IP (Intellectual Property), alongside our range of GI products, significantly differentiates Creo in the market. This is a very proud moment for the whole Creo team who have worked so hard to reach this milestone.\n\"One of our founding advisory key opinion leaders, Professor Robert Hawes MD, once described SpydrBlade\n\u2122 Flex\nas 'incredible, the harmonic scalpel at the end of a flexible scope!'. This is high praise from one of the founding fathers of therapeutic endoscopy and a great comparison highlighting our mission to put advanced surgical OR capability into flexible endoscopy.\n\"With the foundations of an established route to market through our existing sales channels, established and defined future reimbursement (CPT codes), we are excited by the potential adoption of\nSpydrBlade\u2122 Flex and look forward\nto patients, clinicians and healthcare providers being able to benefit from the widespread commercialisation of\nSpydrBlade\n\u2122\nFlex in the USA.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nCreo Medical Group plc\nwww.creomedical.com\nRichard Craven, Company Secretary\nVia Walbrook PR\nDeutsche Numis (Nominated Adviser, sole Broker and Financial Adviser)\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Sher Shah\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\ncreo@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 /\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Creo Medical\nCreo Medical is a medical device company focused on the development and commercialisation of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, bringing advanced energy to endoscopy.\nThe Company's vision is to improve patient outcomes through the development and commercialisation of a suite of electrosurgical medical devices, each enabled by CROMA, powered by Kamaptive.

It allows for more accurate pathology and has been associated with lower recurrence rates, faster recovery, and fewer complications.\nCreo Medical collaborated with a consortium of medical societies, key opinion leaders and industry partners to gather peer-reviewed clinical data illustrating improved clinical outcomes, and procedural data highlighting the growing adoption\nof GI ESD procedures in the clinical community. This collaborative effort demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and long-term benefits of ESD, reinforcing its value in delivering better patient outcomes and supporting its recognition through formal CPT coding.\nIt is estimated that around 5% of the U.S. population over the age of 50 could potentially benefit from an ESD procedure. The data suggest that indications potentially suitable for ESD treatment are diagnosed in between 5% and 10% of the annual c.16 million U.S. colonoscopies performed. The establishment of re-imbursement for lower GI ESD will open up access to this procedure to a much larger proportion of these US patients with the clinical benefits demonstrated.\nThe establishment of these reimbursement codes will also help drive continued medical innovation by enabling and encouraging the use of next-generation products such as Creo's\nSpeedboat\u00ae UltraSlim\n, and\nSpeedboat\u00ae\nNotch\ndesigned specifically for ESD. All Creo's products are designed to empower clinicians with greater precision, safety, and procedural efficiency for complex endoscopic interventions.\nFor more information about ESD and Creo Medical's full portfolio of unique advanced energy products, visit:\nwww.creomedical.com/esd\nCommenting, Craig Gulliford, Chief Executive Officer, said\n:\n\"\nThis is a transformative moment for patients, clinicians, and the broader GI community. The AMA's decision to establish dedicated CPT codes for ESD will help remove barriers to access, enabling broader adoption of this advanced, minimally invasive procedure in the U.S. We are proud to have worked alongside leading societies, key opinion leaders, and industry partners to build the clinical evidence base needed to support this milestone. With clearer reimbursement pathways now in place, more patients will benefit from safer, and more effective treatment options utilising Creo's range of products.\n\"\nFor further information please contact:\nCreo Medical Group plc\nwww.creomedical.com\nRichard Craven, Company Secretary\nVia Walbrook PR\nDeutsche Numis (Nominated Adviser, sole Broker and Financial Adviser)\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Euan Brown / Sher Shah\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\ncreo@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 /\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nAbout Creo Medical\nCreo is a medical device company focused on the development and commercialisation of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, bringing advanced energy to endoscopy.\nThe Company's vision is to improve patient outcomes through the development and commercialisation of a suite of electrosurgical medical devices, each enabled by CROMA, powered by Kamaptive.

St Mark's Hospital is also an established and regular user of Creo's Speedboat UltraSlim.\nCreo will be ramping up the full commercial launch via its core sales channels in the UK and the EU as well as other international territories, including the US, once local regulatory approvals have been received.\nSpydrBlade Flex will be showcased amongst the latest endoscopy technology at the upcoming ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) Days 2025 conference in Barcelona in April.\nCraig Gulliford, Chief Executive Officer of Creo, said:\n\"We are delighted to announce the commercial launch of our\nSpydrBlade Flex product in the UK and across Europe and it is fitting that the first commercial customer is such a recognised centre as St Marks. SpydrBlade really is one of the most advanced surgical tools and again, Creo have pioneered the introduction of this technology into the tiny footprint of a flexible endoscopic instrument. Speedboat UltraSlim alongside SpydrBlade Flex will enhance the care of patients with a wide range of conditions ranging from cancers to swallowing disorders, as well as their increasing use in the rapidly growing treatment of Barriatric conditions.\n\"Both products will continue to help move the point of care from Surgery and the operating theatre to the endoscopy room allowing us to further reduce surgical waiting lists not only in the NHS, but globally\n.

The Company is transitioning from development phase to full commercialisation which has allowed management to take steps to proactively manage the cost base, with significant cost reductions undertaken in H2 24 with the full benefit to come through in FY25.\nThe Company expects to report revenues of \u00a330.4m (FY23: \u00a330.8m), reflecting the following:\n\u00a7\n74% increase in Creo Core Technology\nrevenues to \u00a34.0m (FY23: \u00a32.3m), with \u00a32.4m of sales in H2 24, representing 50% growth half-on-half. Creo Core Technology revenues include sales from all core products such as\nSpeedboat UltraSlim\nand CROMA platform and significant new customer additions during the period.\n\u00a7\nKamaptive\n:\nGood progress was made towards the commercial use of the MicroBlate\u2122 Flex ablation device for robotic-guided procedures for lung cancer. Two UK sites are now performing combined diagnosis and ablation procedures using MicroBlate\u2122 Flex with the Intuitive Ion Endoluminal System. As part of the amended agreement with Intuitive (as\nannounced on 2 July 2024\n), further sites are\nexpected to come on stream in the near future, with the expectation that each site becomes revenue generating once the initial cases have been completed. As such, whilst the initial post-market cases are being completed, no revenues associated with this were recorded in the period (FY23: \u00a31.7m).\n\u00a7\nCreo Medical Europe Consumables\nrevenues were up\n2.6\n% in constant currency in line with management expectations. Reported revenues expected to be \u00a3\n26.4m\n(FY23: \u00a3\n26.8m\n) reflecting some forex headwinds in the period. The Creo Medical Europe Consumables will be held as discontinued activities in the Group's FY24 audited results following the Sale (as referenced below).\nAs committed, actions to reduce costs in the second half of the year resulted in a decrease in operating costs of approximately \u00a35.0m\nwith the full benefit of to come through in FY25.\nStrategic development & receipt of cash proceeds\nIn\nSeptember 2024\n, the Group announced the sale of a 51% interest in the Company's Creo Europe business to Micro-Tech with proceeds of approximately \u20ac30m payable in cash on completion (the \"Sale\"). The Sale completed on 12 February 2025, with the cash proceeds received on 14 February 2025. Following completion of the Sale, the Group's cash and cash equivalents were \u00a331.2m. The strategic transaction with Micro-Tech strengthens Creo's commercial platform and enables Creo to continue to fund the ongoing strategic development of its core technology business.\nCurrent Trading and Outlook\nThe start to the year has been positive and the Company is trading in line with management expectations.\nFurther details on the operational performance of the business, including the growing adoption of\nCreo Core Technology,\nwill be provided with the full year results expected to be announced in April 2025.\nFor further information please contact:\nCreo Medical Group plc\nwww.creomedical.com\nRichard Craven, Company Secretary\nVia Walbrook PR\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nStephen Keys / Camilla Hume / George Lawson (NOMAD)\nMichael Johnson (Sales)\nDeutsche Numis (Joint Broker)\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Euan Brown\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\ncreo@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nPhillip Marriage\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 /\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nMob: +44 (0)7867 984 082\nAbout Creo Medical\nCreo is a medical device company focused on the development and commercialisation of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, bringing advanced energy to endoscopy.\nThe Company's vision is to improve patient outcomes through the development and commercialisation of a suite of electrosurgical medical devices, each enabled by CROMA, powered by Kamaptive.

Developed by Welsh med-tech company Creo Medical, this innovative device offers a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgery, significantly improving patient outcomes and recovery times.\nCurrently, patients with complex polyps often face multiple procedures or major surgery, which can result in lengthy recovery times and higher risks. The Speedboat device allows clinicians to perform a single, minimally invasive procedure to remove polyps effectively, reducing the need for surgery and enabling faster patient recovery. Introducing this technology addresses a critical gap in treatment services in Wales.\nDr. Alka Joshi, Clinical Lead for the pilot, commented:\n\"This pilot is a significant step forward for our patients. By utilising the Speedboat device, we can offer a more efficient, less invasive alternative to traditional surgical methods, improving outcomes and reducing waiting times.\"\nSince the pilot's launch before Christmas, three patients have undergone the treatment successfully with no recorded complications. Each procedure was completed in a single session, and all patients were discharged the same day. One patient even resumed normal activities, including Christmas shopping, the very next day.\nBacked by the Health Board's Clinical Safety and Effectiveness Group, the pilot is supported by Creo's on-site clinical education program, which reduces clinician training time from years to just months. This mentorship model enables ABUHB to embed the procedure at pace while ensuring safety and cost-effectiveness, creating a potential replicable blueprint for adoption across other health boards in Wales.\nRob Holcombe, Finance Director & Innovation Executive Lead at ABUHB, stated:\n\"We are proud to champion this innovative Welsh technology in ABUHB. The early success of this pilot highlights the Board's commitment to delivering solutions that enhance patient care, reduce pressure on surgical services and demonstrate ABUHB's approach to adopting medical innovation through 'value- based health care' outcome evaluation.\"\nThe ABUHB video can be viewed here:\nhttps://vimeo.com/1053790954\nCraig Gulliford, Chief Executive Officer of Creo, said:\n\"As a Welsh company, it is\nexciting that the Aneurin Bevan team\nare the first in Wales to use our Speedboat for the benefit of its colon cancer patients;\nthe SSD pilot in could enhance patient outcomes, reduce surgical waiting lists, and facilitate the wider adoption of this technique across other Health Boards in Wales.\n\"\nFor further information please contact:\nCreo Medical Group plc\nwww.creomedical.com\nRichard Craven, Company Secretary\nVia Walbrook PR\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nStephen Keys / Camilla Hume / George Lawson (NOMAD)\nMichael Johnson (Sales)\nDeutsche Numis (Joint Broker)\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Euan Brown\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\ncreo@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nPhillip Marriage\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 /\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nMob: +44 (0)7867 984 082\nAbout Creo Medical\nCreo is a medical device company focused on the development and commercialisation of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, bringing advanced energy to endoscopy.\nThe Company's vision is to improve patient outcomes through the development and commercialisation of a suite of electrosurgical medical devices, each enabled by CROMA, powered by Kamaptive.

The Group has developed the CROMA powered by Kamaptive full-spectrum adaptive technology to optimise surgical capability and patient outcomes. Kamaptive is a seamless, intuitive integration of multi-modal energy sources, optimised to dynamically adapt to patient tissue during procedures such as resection, dissection, coagulation and ablation of tissue. Kamaptive technology provides clinicians with increased flexibility, precision and controlled surgical solutions. CROMA currently delivers bipolar radiofrequency (\"RF\") energy for precise localised cutting and focused high frequency microwave (\"MW\") energy for controlled coagulation and ablation via a single accessory port. This technology, combined with the Group's range of patented electrosurgical devices, is designed to provide clinicians with flexible, accurate and controlled clinical solutions. The Directors believe the Company's technology can impact the landscape of surgery and endoscopy by providing a safer, less-invasive and more cost-efficient option for procedures.\nFor more information, please refer to the website\nwww.creomedical.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nCreo Medical Group plc\n(\"Creo\" the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nTransaction to establish Strategic Partnership with leading global endoscopy manufacturer\nSale of 51% interest in Creo's European subsidiary for approximately\n\u20ac36.7\nm in cash on a cash free, debt free basis\nAccess to expanded complementary OEM product portfolio for distribution through Creo's channels\nCreo Medical Group plc (AIM: CREO), a medical device company focused on the emerging field of minimally invasive surgical endoscopy for pre-cancer and cancer patients, announces that it has entered into a binding agreement with Micro-Tech (NL) International B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro-Tech (Nanjing) Co. Ltd (SHA:\n688029)\n(\n\"\nMicro-Tech\n\"\n) for the sale of 51% of the issued share capital of Creo Medical S.L.U. (\n\"\nCreo Europe\n\"\n), a wholly owned subsidiary of Creo, at an equity value of \u20ac72m (the\n\"\nSale\n\"\n) on a cash-free, debt-free basis.\nThe net proceeds payable to Creo from the Sale (the\n\"\nProceeds\n\"\n) will strengthen the Group's balance sheet, enabling it to continue to invest in its core Creo and Kamaptive business and deliver on its commercial and operational objectives. The Proceeds are expected to be approximately \u20ac30m which will be payable in cash on completion. For the year ended 31 December 2023, Creo Europe contributed \u20ac3.6m of profits before tax and \u20ac8.8m of net assets (excluding cash balances). The transaction includes customary acquisition terms, including in respect of the operation of the Creo Europe up until completion and no material adverse event occurring during the period until completion. Ongoing shareholder terms have also been agreed which include a future exit framework for Creo.\nBackground and Strategic Rationale\nCreo Europe (formerly Albyn Medical S.L.) was acquired by Creo Medical Group plc in 2020 as a route to expand its\ncommercial platform in\u00a0Europe by providing\na direct route-to-market for Creo's full suite of advanced energy devices and complementing these through an Original Equipment Manufacturer (\"\nOEM\n\") strategy to develop the Creo brand in the market with increased long-term security in the supply chain.\nSince then,\nCreo Europe has grown organically and through acquisition, expanding its geographic reach, incorporating Creo branded endotherapy products to its product range, and complementing the Group\n'\ns core technology products to provide clinicians with a complete product solution for everyday endoscopic procedures.\nToday, Creo Europe manufactures and distributes specialist\nGastroenterology, Urology and Endoscopy products to healthcare providers\nacross Europe, with a product range including Creo's own manufactured products, Creo-branded (third-party manufactured) products, and third-party branded (i.e. distributed) products, predominantly in the major European markets\n.\nThe strategic transaction with Micro-Tech:\n\u00b7\nStrengthens Creo\n'\ns commercial platform;\n\u00b7\nExpands Creo\n'\ns endoscopic therapy product range in all markets;\n\u00b7\nGives Creo Europe access to\nMicro-Tech's specialised global distribution and manufacturing expertise; and\n\u00b7\nEnables Creo to continue to fund the ongoing strategic development of its core technology business.\nCreo Europe's managing director, Luis Collantes, will continue to manage and operate the business with the support of both Creo and Micro-Tech. Alongside Micro-Tech, Creo will retain a number of seats on the board of Creo Europe.\nCreo and Micro-Tech have agreed to explore a co-branding and registration strategy for certain Creo core products into the large Chinese market.\nCompletion\nAlong with other customary conditions, completion of the Sale is contingent on Micro-Tech obtaining Outbound Direct Investment clearance in China along with Foreign Direct Investment clearances in Spain, France, Belgium and Germany.\nWhilst there is no certainty as to receipt or timing of receipt of the necessary approvals to enable completion, it is expected that\ncompletion will take place during Q1 2025 dependent on these relevant clearances being obtained.\nAbout Micro-Tech\nMicro-Tech was founded in 2000 and is the market leader in endoscopic therapy\nmedical devices\nin China with an approximate market share of 30% of China's endoscopy\ndevice\nmarket, designing, manufacturing and selling a range of minimally invasive medical instruments. In 2023, Micro-Tech recorded revenue of RMB 2.4bn (c. \u00a3250m), and a net profit of RMB 495m (c. \u00a353m), making it one of the largest Gastrointestinal (GI) consumables suppliers in the world.

The mantra of the day was \u201cEverything energy for endoscopy\u201d, a plug and play platform and a unique offering, unifying bipolar energy and microwave RF. No new financial information was provided, but it appears confident in meeting FY25 numbers. Key takeaways: (1) large TAM and supportive market drivers (2) positive physician testimonies on the tech/platform; (3) a fuller suite of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027; (4) large potential upside in US market from 2027 (CPT code), and with Intuitive/MicroBlate (studies ongoing), and (5) numbers now set more prudently, while confident in achieving break-even by 2028 and comfortable on funding. CMD takeaways: Market drivers intact: Large TAM of which it is focusing on a smaller portion ($1.5bn SAM). Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics. New product launches: Currently 8 products in multi-therapeutic areas, and will have a full suit of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027 (launching 4 new GI products in next 2 years). A dedicated CPT code in US for ESD from Jan 2027 should standardize national reimbursement and is key to unlocking US growth. With regards to Intuitive, MicroBlate feedback and data (not peer reviewed) is positive thus far, but needs to build more evidence, with studies ongoing, and this is a 2027 story. No new financial info: Reiterated guidance for 40-60% growth in FY25. Growth in next 12 months almost all from existing products (Speedboat, SpydrBlade and a little bit from MicroBlate). New products to contribute after that. Along with a right sized cost base, break-even EBITDA still expected in 2028 and believe sufficiently funded to get there. No change to forecasts We expect 50% growth to \u00a36m in FY25, and a U/L EBITDA loss of \u00a312.5m, implying a further sequential reduction in losses in H2. Further out, we expect 50%+ growth y/y and EBITDA break-even in 2028. We expect Creo to end the year with cash of c.\u00a313m.",

With new products launched and US reimbursement to come from 2027, the company is now poised to grow users (and utilisation) and dominate the endoscopy energy segment. This should mean strong growth, further margin improvement, and ultimately to achieve break-even (EBITDA) in a few years. A broader range of devices (several commercial launches), potential future licensing opportunities for robotics (Kamaptive tech), and optionality with Micro-Tech, should underpin this path to break-even and beyond, while being well funded through to 2027.",

Furthermore I needed separate visits for an endoscopy. Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages. Being opened up from the outside also introduces more risk of picking up an infection. What Creo enables, especially in treatment of lung and pancreatic cancer, feels like Dr Bones Star Trek stuff.",

The evaluation, running at Amsterdam University Medical Centre and London\u2019s Royal Brompton Hospital, is designed to assess how well the MicroBlate Flex performs when used to ablate \u2013 destroy, in other words \u2013 lung tumours before surgical removal. By analysing the tumour after surgery, doctors can compare the actual results to pre- and post-treatment scans, giving a clear picture of the device\u2019s effectiveness. This latest study adds to Creo\u2019s ongoing clinical work, including another post-market trial focused on patient safety and long-term follow-up, as well as a partnership with Intuitive. The latter involves robotically guided tumour ablation using MicroBlate Flex combined with Intuitive\u2019s Ion system, aiming to build a strong clinical case before the device becomes widely available. \"Our collaboration with Intuitive further strengthens our emerging position at the forefront of minimally invasive lung cancer treatment and highlights the broad potential of MicroBlate Flex as we move toward commercialisation,\" said CEO Craig Gulliford.",

US is big in my mind. I noted yesterday Rolls Royce are FTSE listed but 50% of shares are held in the US. I suspect this will be part of the boards plans to get a good chunk in the US / EU & in time Asia. That would appeal to a full takeover customer namely a chinese one to get US / EU coverage ?",

I expect to see a buy later after 1:30pm of \u00a310-14k If not the full \u00a314k whatever is leftover to grease the demand being generated over the weekend to Monday. Something is freshening the air like a Fabreeze air freshner pump. A big buy being ordered between 11:30am GMT and usually being filled prior to or on the 13:30am GMT 2-3 times a week.

Often sold in to , but in Creo Medicals case any good news should see an early stage development of trading to First hour rise Profit taking by the end of the hour AND sellers selling in to premarket ordering on good news from the US in hours 2 & 3. Substantial news will naturally charge the share price to an upward trend by end of year and in to H1 2026. Just got to wait as per normal for this expected trend to begin. Hopefully the above will prove to be correct OR Creo Medical get bought out before the correct share price potential is hit? I would like to see the board rewarded by bringing the sp and company growth back up towrds previous highs before any buyout happens.

Yes, that money is going into supporting Creo as its user base grows. That is the significant point. The user base is growing and at a good pace. Creo is a company that is now moving from a development plan to a commercial one. As I say, we all look at these things from different view points. I was starting to get frustrated myself with the management a year or so ago. However, the updated board have the bull by the horns. The current SP reflects a market wanting to see further progress. Once it does you won't be buying at this price again. Question is, do you think the user base will continue to grow?",

The mantra of the day was \u201cEverything energy for endoscopy\u201d, a plug and play platform and a unique offering, unifying bipolar energy and microwave RF. No new financial information was provided, but it appears confident in meeting FY25 numbers. Key takeaways: (1) large TAM and supportive market drivers (2) positive physician testimonies on the tech/platform; (3) a fuller suite of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027; (4) large potential upside in US market from 2027 (CPT code), and with Intuitive/MicroBlate (studies ongoing), and (5) numbers now set more prudently, while confident in achieving break-even by 2028 and comfortable on funding. CMD takeaways: Market drivers intact: Large TAM of which it is focusing on a smaller portion ($1.5bn SAM). Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics. New product launches: Currently 8 products in multi-therapeutic areas, and will have a full suit of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027 (launching 4 new GI products in next 2 years). A dedicated CPT code in US for ESD from Jan 2027 should standardize national reimbursement and is key to unlocking US growth. With regards to Intuitive, MicroBlate feedback and data (not peer reviewed) is positive thus far, but needs to build more evidence, with studies ongoing, and this is a 2027 story. No new financial info: Reiterated guidance for 40-60% growth in FY25. Growth in next 12 months almost all from existing products (Speedboat, SpydrBlade and a little bit from MicroBlate). New products to contribute after that. Along with a right sized cost base, break-even EBITDA still expected in 2028 and believe sufficiently funded to get there. No change to forecasts We expect 50% growth to \u00a36m in FY25, and a U/L EBITDA loss of \u00a312.5m, implying a further sequential reduction in losses in H2. Further out, we expect 50%+ growth y/y and EBITDA break-even in 2028. We expect Creo to end the year with cash of c.\u00a313m.",

With new products launched and US reimbursement to come from 2027, the company is now poised to grow users (and utilisation) and dominate the endoscopy energy segment. This should mean strong growth, further margin improvement, and ultimately to achieve break-even (EBITDA) in a few years. A broader range of devices (several commercial launches), potential future licensing opportunities for robotics (Kamaptive tech), and optionality with Micro-Tech, should underpin this path to break-even and beyond, while being well funded through to 2027.",

Instead of letting it ride on the boast from the part sale of Creo Europe they spooked the investors then did a minor raise at far too low a value. All that achieved was flooring the sp and momentum. Thick. They have though made much better management choices since the new chair came on board and got sense and urgency back. It will get there as the product is good, sales are increasing, costs reduced and a huge market potential.",

I\u2019ve had keyhole surgery on my oesophagus twice and while it\u2019s far better than being opened up with a large incision, the surgeon still has to make 5 puncture wounds to get all the kit in, including a gas tube to bloat you up so the surgeon can see what he\u2019s doing. Furthermore I needed separate visits for an endoscopy. Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages. Being opened up from the outside also introduces more risk of picking up an infection. What Creo enables, especially in treatment of lung and pancreatic cancer, feels like Dr Bones Star Trek stuff.",

No new financial information was provided, but it appears confident in meeting FY25 numbers. Key takeaways: (1) large TAM and supportive market drivers (2) positive physician testimonies on the tech/platform; (3) a fuller suite of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027; (4) large potential upside in US market from 2027 (CPT code), and with Intuitive/MicroBlate (studies ongoing), and (5) numbers now set more prudently, while confident in achieving break-even by 2028 and comfortable on funding. CMD takeaways: Market drivers intact: Large TAM of which it is focusing on a smaller portion ($1.5bn SAM). Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics. New product launches: Currently 8 products in multi-therapeutic areas, and will have a full suit of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027 (launching 4 new GI products in next 2 years). A dedicated CPT code in US for ESD from Jan 2027 should standardize national reimbursement and is key to unlocking US growth. With regards to Intuitive, MicroBlate feedback and data (not peer reviewed) is positive thus far, but needs to build more evidence, with studies ongoing, and this is a 2027 story. No new financial info: Reiterated guidance for 40-60% growth in FY25. Growth in next 12 months almost all from existing products (Speedboat, SpydrBlade and a little bit from MicroBlate). New products to contribute after that. Along with a right sized cost base, break-even EBITDA still expected in 2028 and believe sufficiently funded to get there. No change to forecasts We expect 50% growth to \u00a36m in FY25, and a U/L EBITDA loss of \u00a312.5m, implying a further sequential reduction in losses in H2. Further out, we expect 50%+ growth y/y and EBITDA break-even in 2028. We expect Creo to end the year with cash of c.\u00a313m.",

Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics. New product launches: Currently 8 products in multi-therapeutic areas, and will have a full suit of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027 (launching 4 new GI products in next 2 years). A dedicated CPT code in US for ESD from Jan 2027 should standardize national reimbursement and is key to unlocking US growth. With regards to Intuitive, MicroBlate feedback and data (not peer reviewed) is positive thus far, but needs to build more evidence, with studies ongoing, and this is a 2027 story. No new financial info: Reiterated guidance for 40-60% growth in FY25. Growth in next 12 months almost all from existing products (Speedboat, SpydrBlade and a little bit from MicroBlate). New products to contribute after that. Along with a right sized cost base, break-even EBITDA still expected in 2028 and believe sufficiently funded to get there. No change to forecasts We expect 50% growth to \u00a36m in FY25, and a U/L EBITDA loss of \u00a312.5m, implying a further sequential reduction in losses in H2. Further out, we expect 50%+ growth y/y and EBITDA break-even in 2028. We expect Creo to end the year with cash of c.\u00a313m.

With new products launched and US reimbursement to come from 2027, the company is now poised to grow users (and utilisation) and dominate the endoscopy energy segment. This should mean strong growth, further margin improvement, and ultimately to achieve break-even (EBITDA) in a few years. A broader range of devices (several commercial launches), potential future licensing opportunities for robotics (Kamaptive tech), and optionality with Micro-Tech, should underpin this path to break-even and beyond, while being well funded through to 2027.",

Furthermore I needed separate visits for an endoscopy. Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages. Being opened up from the outside also introduces more risk of picking up an infection. What Creo enables, especially in treatment of lung and pancreatic cancer, feels like Dr Bones Star Trek stuff.",

The evaluation, running at Amsterdam University Medical Centre and London\u2019s Royal Brompton Hospital, is designed to assess how well the MicroBlate Flex performs when used to ablate \u2013 destroy, in other words \u2013 lung tumours before surgical removal. By analysing the tumour after surgery, doctors can compare the actual results to pre- and post-treatment scans, giving a clear picture of the device\u2019s effectiveness. This latest study adds to Creo\u2019s ongoing clinical work, including another post-market trial focused on patient safety and long-term follow-up, as well as a partnership with Intuitive. The latter involves robotically guided tumour ablation using MicroBlate Flex combined with Intuitive\u2019s Ion system, aiming to build a strong clinical case before the device becomes widely available. \"Our collaboration with Intuitive further strengthens our emerging position at the forefront of minimally invasive lung cancer treatment and highlights the broad potential of MicroBlate Flex as we move toward commercialisation,\" said CEO Craig Gulliford.",

US is big in my mind. I noted yesterday Rolls Royce are FTSE listed but 50% of shares are held in the US.

Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages.

Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages.

Been to an AGM (I live close to chepstow, met Kevin Crofton seemed decent (as did Craig) but I'm not going to judge on that. I've worked in a similar industry and have a decent understanding of the products. My thoughts are thus 1) They hit their targets for the first time in the recent TU. Great, but one swallow doesn't make a summer etc. 2) They are happy with the forecasts for this year - after only 3 weeks. Great to have confidence. FY forecasts is something like 11-12m, the two brokers (Edison/Cavendish) have differing forecasts. Thats roughly double last years sales. 3) If they hit that and keep costs under control then the company is much closer to being viable. I'd be interested to know \"like for like\" headcount now vs 2025. The costs didn't drop as much as I expected. Prove we can get close then other sources of funding may become available. 4) The timescale for NICE take up will be slower than mentioned. The way that the Croma platform works is different to standard procedures and requires some training. Its needs a few days training and some hand holding and can't be adopted overnight. The last thing you'd want to hear before going under is the surgeon asking \"what does this button do\" :-) 5) US adoption will be key. Thats not going to happen until 2027 due to the reimbursement happening then. 6) I'm hoping for some more clinical results this year and next, hopefully getting Intuitive more involved and promoting it on their Ion Endoluminal system. That would be a huge installed base to bring on board. As I've said here and elsewhere I think these results may be an inflection point. I hope so, I have a large position thats somewhat underwater. I've not added to my position (clearly I should have traded, but thats not my style). Hopefully they will keep the market up to date more regularly to show they are on track. If they are at HY I'll probably buy more.",

Thankfully, we only bought in over the last 12 months or so as my biggest issue with any management team is raising money at 24p and subsequently watching the price go under 10p. They of course will say that is not something they control but I disagree. Great management teams understand the importance of building momentum and always delivering, over and over again, on what you guide. The price chart of Creo sends a very strong message to management (and they have been the same people) on how they have done so far. Lets not forget this is a tiny company trying to bark with the big dogs and yes while it may have hundreds of patents it is interesting to me that most of the expenditure has been expenses. If it was so enduring surely it would have been capitalised. Their capitalised IA is \u00a30.7M as at June, insignificant really. From June to Dec the cash burn has been just under \u00a38m, \u00a36.3M on receipt of the available for sale. They are running out of things to sell. They do have another tax receivable of \u00a32.9M but after that, they are just left with Medtech. On this entity they dont need to tie capital in this entity, they can achieve what they need with a contractual relationship and a smaller \"good faith\" equity stake. At the end of the day at 49% they are still out voted. If there is some other reason for retaining 49% they should be explicit about it. From an IR perspective I find them very poor communicators which you only have to look at the share price for an independent view on.",

          "content": "Senator1 I agree 100%; results day guidance on revenue is everything now. Regarding the cash flow and the Europe stake, I think our risk appetites might differ slightly: 1.\tThe Cash Position: We finished FY25 with \u00a312.4m cash. Management expects to reach self-sustaining cash flows, and with the current burn rate narrowing rapidly, the bridge to profitability is shorter than the market thinks. 2.\tThe Non-Dilutive Options: Equity funding below 24p would be incredibly difficult to justify. This is why a managed drawdown facility is such a strong option. Securing credit is a strategic 'Fortress Balance Sheet' move; it\u2019s not about intending to spend the cash, but having it available removes the 'smell of a raise' and signals external banking confidence in the 2027 numbers. 3.\tMicroTech as a Strategic Asset: We should move away from seeing the 49% MicroTech stake as just a 'backstop.' It's a high-value strategic asset that strengthens the group valuation. Having \u20ac30m of value locked in a performing associate is a luxury most AIM peers simply don't have. The Bigger Picture: Ultimately, while we debate the cash flow, we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the scarcity of this asset. We are looking at a company with 400+ patents and an energy platform that has already been validated by a global titan like Intuitive Surgical. With the NICE Mandate [GID-MT602] landing in Nov 2026, we are transitioning from 'disruptive tech' to a legally mandated standard of care in the NHS. That shift\u2014combined with 100% margin royalties starting to ramp\u2014is the perfect storm for a significant re-rating. At 14p/15p, the market is pricing in the historical 'struggle' while completely ignoring the imminent commercial explosion. The J-curve is coming; I\u2019m happy to wait for the guidance to confirm it.

          "content": "That is a very common perception, but it's important to distinguish between 'clinical guidelines' and 'funding mandates.' The MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) is backed by specific legal and contractual requirements. Here is what happens if an NHS unit refuses to comply: 1.\tContractual Breach: The NHS Standard Contract is the legally binding document between commissioners (ICBs) and providers (Trusts). General Condition 2.2 explicitly mandates compliance with MTFM guidance. Refusal to fund Speedboat would constitute a breach of contract, allowing the commissioner to withhold payments or issue a formal 'Contract Query.' 2.\tFinancial Penalties: Under the NHS System Oversight Framework, NHS England monitors 'efficiency and productivity.' Since Speedboat is proven by NICE to be cost-saving (saving ~\u00a35k per procedure), a Trust that refuses to adopt it is intentionally wasting taxpayer money. This can lead to a 'Requires Improvement' rating, which triggers direct intervention from NHS England and can impact the Trust\u2019s future capital allocations. 3.\tThe '90-Day' Legal Clock: The Health and Social Care Act creates a statutory obligation to make funding available within 90 days of a NICE publication. Patients and clinicians can legally challenge a Trust that fails to provide a mandated, cost-saving treatment. 4.\tNo Local Veto: The MTFM Policy Guidance is clear: local 'affordability' is not an excuse. Because the technology is cost-saving, the policy is designed to overcome the very barriers people are worried about. So, while some Trusts might be slow, they cannot simply say 'no' without facing serious regulatory and financial consequences. By February 2027, the 'jump' to adopting Creo's technology isn't just expected\u2014it is contractually and legally mandated.

          "content": "Senator1 Excellent analysis and fair points raised. The math on the \u00a330m PBT breakeven at 60% GP is a solid baseline, but I believe it overlooks three critical 'accelerants' that pull that date into 2027: 1.\tThe NICE Mandate J-Curve: I\u2019ve factored in a deployment lag here. The Nov 2026 Mandate [GID-MT602] requires NHS commissioners to provide funding within 90 days of publication. So while the mandate drops in November, the enforceable revenue flow is guaranteed to start by Feb 2027. This timeline is built into the Jan 2027 profitability projection, turning linear adoption into a mandated surge by Q1 2027. 2.\tThe 'Giant' Validation & Royalty Layer: The \u00a330m model typically assumes standard 60% margins on physical hardware. It completely overlooks the Kamaptive licensing flow. When giants like Intuitive Surgical (ION) and CMR Surgical sign up for our energy solution, they validate it as Best-in-Class. These deals provide virtually 100% margin royalty income, which drops straight to the bottom line, shortening the path to PBT breakeven. Furthermore, with 400+ patents protecting the core IP, it's highly likely more 'Giants' will follow to avoid being left behind. 3.\tThe 17-Year Salary Metric: Chairman Kevin Crofton is paid ~\u00a365k/year, yet has put \u00a31.1m of his own post-tax cash into this. He has effectively invested 17 years of his salary back into the company. A man who delivered a $2.3bn exit at SPTS isn't betting on a 2029 crawl; he is positioned for the 2026/27 inflection point. You are absolutely right: Guidance for 2026 on results day will be key. We need management to shift their narrative from qualitative statements ('encouraging momentum') to quantitative metrics ('procedures per site') to show that this J-curve is real. We are all waiting for that clarity. The 2029 projection is a 'linear' view of a company hitting a 'regulatory and royalty' turbocharger. At 14p, the market is pricing in the history but ignoring the imminent mandate and the high-margin royalty ramping.

I hold 1,315,000 CREO shares. 3. The Math: The Path to Profitability (The J-Curve) The \"Bear Case\" relies on historical cash burn, but the numbers show we have hit the inflection point. This is driven by Operational Leverage: \u2022\tRevenue Velocity: FY25 H2 revenue surged 58% to \u00a33.8m. \u2022\tCost Discipline: Underlying OpEx was \"right-sized\" with a 20% reduction to \u00a318.4m. \u2022\tThe Logic: The company does not need to cut further; it simply needs to grow into its fixed cost base. As revenue scales toward a \u00a325m\u2013\u00a330m run-rate* (fueled by the NICE mandate and robotic royalties), the stable cost base allows Gross Profits to bridge the gap. Mathematically, the \"crossover point\" to self-sustaining cash flow is visible by late 2026/Jan 2027. \u2022\t*Note: Revenue run-rate figures are forward-looking projections based on the current 58% H2 growth trajectory and 60% target margins. 4. The \u00a31bn+ Buyout Potential Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p, with a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) suggested by Edison Group analysts once profitability is proven. \u2022\tM&A Logic: High-growth, high-IP MedTech carries a 10x revenue multiple. As Creo approaches a \u00a3100m run-rate, a \u00a31bn+ valuation is entirely consistent with sector precedents (e.g., Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $13.1bn Shockwave acquisition). Summary: I believe the stock is deeply undervalued and waiting for the market to price in the \"J-curve.\" For those underwater, the disconnect between the ~14.5p price and the 24p insider floor represents a significant opportunity.",

TL;DR Summary: \u2022\tInsane Entry Price: Buying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s anchor investment (24p). \u2022\tThe NICE Catalyst: NICE hand-picked Speedboat to optimize NHS resources; legal mandate for funding expected Nov 19, 2026. \u2022\tTechnical Moat: Only tech to beat the \"heat-sink\" effect in lung/liver; 400+ patent moat. \u2022\tThe Math: 58% H2 revenue growth hitting a stabilized cost base makes a Jan 2027 breakeven a mathematical probability. Full Analysis: The current share price of ~14.5p is fundamentally broken and presents an absurd disconnect from operational reality. For private investors with a 12-24 month view, this is a classic \"inflection point\" setup. 1. The Technology Moat: Why it's \"Best-in-Class\" Creo isn't competing on price; they're competing on physics. Their Kamaptive platform is the only tech that miniaturizes microwave and RF energy into a single, tiny device. \u2022\tThe \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Competitors use RF energy, which fails in highly vascularized tissue (lung/liver) because blood flow cools the area (the \"heat-sink effect\"). Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy avoids this, making it the superior clinical tool. \u2022\tThe NICE Selection: NICE specifically selected Speedboat Inject because they identified it as a key technology to ensure the \"best use of NHS resources.\" \u2022\tProven Savings: Real-world data showed the Speedboat procedure reduced hospital stays from 8.4 days to 1.1 days, saving the NHS nearly \u00a35,000 per procedure. 2. The Insider Signal: A Valuation Floor Chairman Kevin Crofton, who delivered a $2.3bn exit at his last company, put over \u00a31 million of his own cash into CREO in 2024/2025. \u2022\tHis initial anchor entry was 24p (\u00a3700k invested). \u2022\tBuying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s primary entry price. If the man tasked with delivering the exit is buying at these levels, the current ~\u00a358m market cap is an anomaly. Continued......",

This should mean strong growth, further margin improvement, and ultimately to achieve break-even (EBITDA) in a few years. A broader range of devices (several commercial launches), potential future licensing opportunities for robotics (Kamaptive tech), and optionality with Micro-Tech, should underpin this path to break-even and beyond, while being well funded through to 2027.",

CMD takeaways: Market drivers intact: Large TAM of which it is focusing on a smaller portion ($1.5bn SAM). Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics. New product launches: Currently 8 products in multi-therapeutic areas, and will have a full suit of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027 (launching 4 new GI products in next 2 years). A dedicated CPT code in US for ESD from Jan 2027 should standardize national reimbursement and is key to unlocking US growth. With regards to Intuitive, MicroBlate feedback and data (not peer reviewed) is positive thus far, but needs to build more evidence, with studies ongoing, and this is a 2027 story. No new financial info: Reiterated guidance for 40-60% growth in FY25. Growth in next 12 months almost all from existing products (Speedboat, SpydrBlade and a little bit from MicroBlate).

The losses have only narrowed slightly, sales numbers have consistently come in like tales of the unexpected. 2028 is far far away, a kind of wishful fantasy where words mean what we want them to mean.

Furthermore I needed separate visits for an endoscopy. Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages. Being opened up from the outside also introduces more risk of picking up an infection. What Creo enables, especially in treatment of lung and pancreatic cancer, feels like Dr Bones Star Trek stuff.",

I just dont think you will get a lender to lend a material amount against it, particularly as Creo dont decide the cashflow (the DVD). i wouldnt want them to borrow on that basis either as if they fell out with Med Tech they are in trouble as they could cut the DVD off quite easily. As a loan, the only way I would take any value from it is if Med_Tech itself lent the money and did so on a limited recourse basis, limited to the cashflow from the DVD, so no general recourse. The market would not value a straight third party loan in the way you think, it would be a negative. The only other sensible way to monetise it is via a further partial sale if that becomes necessary. My cashflow projections suggest it will be very tight as I am pretty sure dealing with NHS type entities will be working capital intensive. If they came to some sort of licencing agreement with Intuitive which had an upfront cash payment, that would also work. Management have said they have the resources to get to cashflow breakeven, given their history, I think they have not made that statement lightly and so hopefully a further sale of the 49% is not needed. However, I would encourage management to explain in detail their calculations on this critical aspect. In fact, I would want Crofton to lead the discussion on this, not the CFO.",

The \"Hybrid\" Victory: Ion + da Vinci Creo is uniquely positioned as the first and only partner to provide a dual-energy (RF/Microwave) platform for both of Intuitive\u2019s flagship robots: Internal Ablation (Ion) via MicroBlate Flex and External Resection (da Vinci) via SpydrBlade Flex. Integrated into the da Vinci platform (10,000+ units globally), Creo is becoming a universal surgical energy standard. 6. Strategic Certainty and the Inevitable Exit At a share price of ~14p and a market cap of roughly \u00a350m, the valuation disconnect is profound. Considering Creo received ~\u00a325m in cash for its European stake, the market effectively values the global IP and robotic partnerships at zero. As robotic and non-invasive surgery becomes the global default, a total buyout by a MedTech giant becomes a strategic certainty. Entities with the cash and the need include: \u2022\tIntuitive Surgical: Seeking a \"closed-loop\" system to capture high-margin consumable revenue. \u2022\tJohnson & Johnson (J&J MedTech): Needing an energy suite for their Ottava\u2122 platform. \u2022\tMedtronic: Looking to replace aging ablation tech with Creo\u2019s precision range. \u2022\tOlympus Corporation: Transitioning from a \"camera company\" into a \"robotic treatment company.\" The technology is on a superb global flight path for both patients and shareholders. For those who see past the noise, Creo represents a foundational opportunity at the start of a global surgical revolution.

          "content": "Part 1 of 2 The Global Robotic Infrastructure: Why the \u00a31.25bn Lung Pillar is Just the Foundation of Creo\u2019s Value Realisation 1. The Macro Catalyst: Wes Streeting, Prof. Shah, and the NICE Pipeline On January 20, 2026, Health Secretary Wes Streeting visited Royal Brompton Hospital, hosted by Professor Pallav Shah and NHS England CEO Amanda Pritchard. Streeting hailed the robotic \"one-stop-shop\" lung procedure as \"the future of the NHS.\" This momentum is backed by a critical regulatory driver: Speedboat\u2122 Inject is under formal NICE assessment, with guidance expected by November 2026. By February 2026, NHS Trusts are preparing business cases to trigger the MedTech Funding Mandate; once NICE approves a cost-saving device, the NHS is legally obliged to fund and adopt it, clearing the path for a rapid revenue surge across the UK\u2019s 350+ hospitals. 2. From Keyhole to Non-Invasive (The Endoluminal Revolution) While the market focus is on robotic \"keyhole\" surgery, Creo\u2019s technology is enabling a shift toward totally non-invasive, incisionless treatment. By using the body\u2019s natural pathways\u2014the airways for lungs and the GI tract for bowel/stomach cancers\u2014Creo allows clinicians to biopsy and ablate tumors without a single external cut. This endoluminal approach reduces recovery times from weeks to hours and is the primary reason clinicians like Professor Pallav Shah describe this as a generational breakthrough. 3. Regulatory Dominance vs. Clinical Adoption (The Data Moat) The core suite\u2014Speedboat, MicroBlate, SlypSeal, and SpydrBlade\u2014already holds CE Mark and FDA Clearance. Ongoing trials are building the Economic Evidence Base, proving Creo\u2019s tech is safer and cheaper than traditional surgery. Real-world NHS data showing that Speedboat\u2122 Inject saves approximately \u00a35,000 per procedure (equating to \u00a3687k per Trust) is foundational to the NICE review. This \"Data Moat\" creates a massive barrier to entry that competitors would require years of clinical data to replicate. 4. The \"Ion\" Maths: A \u00a31.25bn Revenue Pillar (MicroBlate Flex Alone) Lung cancer accounts for 2.2 million new cases annually. The potential for MicroBlate Flex (at ~\u00a35,700 per disposable) represents a massive untapped upside: \u2022\tApproved Base Case (US, EU, UK, Ex-China APAC): ~1.14m new cases p.a. A 10% adoption rate represents a \u00a3650 million annual recurring revenue path. \u2022\tChina Multiplier: Adding China\u2019s ~1.06m cases via the Micro-Tech partnership jumps the potential to \u00a31.25 billion annually.

It sends a clear message to the market that the risk of further dilution is effectively off the table and that Creo is fully funded to act without being forced into an equity raise. Given the growth trajectory and the massive inherent value of the Kamaptive technology, lenders are looking at the 'Tech value' and buyout potential, which provides a much more significant cushion than a simple cash-flow analysis of the European arm. Ultimately, as the core business scales and we hit our stride globally, that 49% stake will eventually look like 'chicken feed' compared to the value of the main enterprise.

Predator Urgency & the \u00a31bn+ Valuation: The Path to Re-rating The current share price of ~14p fundamentally ignores the true strategic value of Creo's assets. A predator's (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, CMR Surgical) interest is in long-term, multi-billion-dollar market access and IP, not today's P&L statement. The path to a \u00a31bn+ valuation uses M&A math, which is different from standard analyst forecasts: \u2022\tAnalyst Price Targets (The Floor): Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p. Edison Group analysts suggested a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) once profitability is proven. This is the market's current conservative \"floor\". \u2022\tThe M&A Strategic Premium (The Ceiling): The \u00a31bn+ valuation is achieved when a predator applies a much higher premium for strategic control. A predator benefits significantly by acquiring now to gain a market and IP monopoly: o\tIntuitive Surgical (The Integration Gap): Intuitive dominates robotic surgery but has historically relied on third-party energy tools. Acquiring Creo would allow them to own the entire \"Search & Destroy\" procedure (diagnosis + ablation) \"in a single sitting,\" a major goal for robotic surgery, and integrate Creo's technology like the MicroBlate Flex into its ION and flagship da Vinci platforms. o\tMedtronic (The Vascular \"Heat-Sink\" Gap): Medtronic is a leader in advanced energy with its LigaSure (RF) products. Standard RF ablation is limited by the \"heat-sink\" effect, where blood flow cools tissue and prevents tumor destruction. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy is largely unaffected by blood flow, providing a \"gold standard\" tool for abating tumors in highly vascularized organs like the liver and pancreas where Medtronic's current tools often fall short. This is achieved using the world\u2019s only 19-gauge less than 1mm) microwave ablation needle, MicroBlate Fine, the only device thin enough to destroy pancreatic and liver tumors internally via standard Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS), avoiding invasive surgery. o\tBoston Scientific (High-Growth Adjacency): Boston Scientific has an established position in interventional oncology and is actively pursuing acquisitions to expand into new high-growth segments and compete with Medtronic. Creo's unique energy platform and product pipeline perfectly align with BSX's strategy of M&A for \"high-growth adjacency\" markets where they have a limited presence today. o\tCMR Surgical (Robotic Energy Gap): CMR is a major global player in robotic surgery with its Versius system. Their primary focus is on the robotic platform itself rather than advanced energy tools. They have a licensing agreement with Creo; an acquisition would allow them to own \"best-in-class\" energy and prevent competitors from doing the same.

But my view is that we are at the precipice of 'Creo Future,' where the RNS transparency improves, some of the IP value is unlocked by the NICE mandate (which is a 'when' not an 'if'), and we hit the J-curve. I hold a very high conviction that the current price fundamentally undervalues the company's prospects. The company is now firmly moving from an R&D entity to a commercial one. Time will tell if management finally delivers, but the data points for a turnaround are stronger than ever. The current share price of ~14p is a reflection of the analyst consensus, combined with high market perception of risk, a liquidity discount, and widespread assumption of future dilution. This entirely ignores the intrinsic value of the \u00a326.9m stake and its cash-generative benefits from the Creo Medical Europe (CME) joint venture, which solidify our 'Fortress Balance Sheet'. My 'J-curve' analysis is ahead of this curve; I believe our (self-funding debt/dividend model from CME) will accelerate profitability by December 2027, closing that valuation gap rapidly and commanding a premium for completely removing the doubt of dilution and reflecting the high probability of a predator buyout. The additional, pure-profit royalty payments (Intuitive/CMR), the MicroBlate Flex US commercial opportunity including da Vinci integration, the new MicroBlate Fine catalyst, and the bipolar range (Speedboat, SpydrBlade, etc.) further support this timeline to December 2027, and \u201cwith a little bit of wind in our sails we could be quiet ahead of that\u201d. Ultimately, let's not forget that beyond the balance sheet, Creo\u2019s technology is changing and saving people's lives every day. That is the most enduring value of all.

External DCF Models Reinforce the Undervaluation The argument for undervaluation extends beyond internal analysis: even external, conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) models consistently produce a share price far exceeding the current ~14p. Some private valuations on boards using robust models have even placed fair value around 43p based on conservative \u00a326m revenue estimates for FY28. \u2022\tConservative Estimates: Independent models using a high WACC (15%) and a subjective \"UK discount\" still arrive at a share price valuation between 47p and 55p. \u2022\tThe Disconnect: This substantial gap highlights the market's current fixation on \"risk\" and \"past performance.\" These models reinforce the argument that the fundamental, de-risked value of the company is already three to four times the current share price. \u2022\tMissing the \"J-Curve\" Catalysts: Standard DCF models struggle to accurately price in the rapid adoption that catalysts like the US CPT code will cause.

Royalty Streams (Pure Profit) & MicroBlate Flex \u2018The Wind in Our Sails\u2019 It is critical to remember that both commercial sales and licensing agreements represent a significant amount of \"wind in our sails\" and high-margin potential. \u2022\tMicroBlate Flex (Commercial Sales): The lung device is purchased commercially for an estimated \u00a35,700 per unit. Revenue from this has a margin well over 60%. Importantly, it is already being sold commercially on an individual basis at the Royal Brompton Hospital. A total of six sites are expected to run in the UK and Europe under the Pioneer Programme to gather clinical evidence ahead of a full commercial launch. A further 1 site is expected to go commercial sales in H1-26. The device is also approved for use in the USA, where the market presents a substantial opportunity for growth. The Intuitive ION partnership also has the potential for expanded scope into the high-growth APAC market. Intuitive Surgical recently announced its FY25 results, stating that ION procedures grew c51% in the year. This procedure growth highlights the immense potential of the US lung tumor opportunity, which is currently not factored into most P&L analyst reports. We should start to see the pull from Intuitive via their sales channels in 2026/2027. \u2022\tRoyalty Streams (Pure Profit): Royalty and licensing agreements have been been signed with both Intuitive Surgical and CMR Surgical. While specific commercial terms remain undisclosed in RNS statements, these are virtually 100% margin incomes that add immense pressure on potential predators to act now, as they would want to limit the licensing of Creo's \"best in class\" advanced energy to their competitors.

The NHS / NICE Mandate: The \"Streeting Factor\" & High Probability of Rapid Adoption This isn't just about clinical guidelines; it's about a legal and political mandate for funding that creates a perfect storm for rapid adoption. For independent verification, you can review the official NICE project page for the Creo Speedboat (GID-MT602) here: www.nice.org.uk. \u2022\tThe NICE Catalyst: NICE hand-picked Speedboat to optimize NHS resources; a legal mandate for funding is expected around November 19, 2026. \u2022\tProven Savings: Real-world data showed the Speedboat procedure reduced hospital stays from 8.4 days to 1.1 days, saving the NHS nearly \u00a35,000 per procedure. \u2022\tThe \"Streeting Factor\" (Why Enforcement is Guaranteed): Wes Streeting has explicitly stated the NHS must 'reform or die,' tying future funding to productivity gains. Under this 'Value for Money' framework, a Trust refusing to adopt a NICE-mandated, cost-saving technology like Speedboat isn't just ignoring a guideline\u2014they are actively defying the government\u2019s core strategy. This creates: o\tContractual & Legal Breach: The NHS Standard Contract mandates compliance with the MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM). Refusal is a breach of contract with financial penalties. o\tNo Local Veto: The MTFM policy is clear: local 'affordability' is not an excuse because the tech is proven to be cost-saving. o\tThe 90-Day Clock: The Health and Social Care Act creates a statutory obligation for funding to be available within 90 days of a NICE publication. By February 2027, the adoption of Creo's technology isn't just expected\u2014it is contractually and legally mandated, acting as a massive 'adoption accelerator.'

The disconnect between Kevin Crofton\u2019s \u00a31.1m personal investment and the current ~14p price provides a clear valuation floor. Since joining in July 2024, he has purchased over \u00a31 million in shares using his own funds, signaling a commitment far beyond his \u00a364k annual fee. His initial anchor entry was 24p (\u00a3700k invested), meaning the current price is a 40% discount to his main entry point. A man who delivered a $2.3bn exit at SPTS did not invest his own capital to wait for a distant FY28/FY29 timeline. He is signaling the 2026/2027 rapid inflection point is imminent. This signal reinforces my personal high conviction in this company. The AMA CPT reimbursement code is a key part of this inflection point. Physicians who may earn $300 for a standard colonoscopy could earn over $1,000 for the procedures Speedboat enables. This massive financial incentive for the US private market will encourage rapid training and adoption as the code comes into effect in January 2027. Furthermore, the NICE Catalyst is another powerful accelerator. A legal mandate for funding is expected around November 19, 2026. This was based on real-world data showing significant reductions in hospital stays and costs per procedure. Wes Streeting's political pressure makes this a powerful adoption accelerator.

Predator Urgency & the \u00a31bn+ Valuation: The Path to Re-rating The current share price of ~14p fundamentally ignores the true strategic value of Creo's assets. A predator's (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, CMR Surgical) interest is in long-term, multi-billion-dollar market access and IP, not today's P&L statement. The path to a \u00a31bn+ valuation uses M&A math, which is different from standard analyst forecasts: \u2022\tAnalyst Price Targets (The Floor): Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p. Edison Group analysts suggested a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) once profitability is proven. This is the market's current conservative \"floor\". \u2022\tThe M&A Strategic Premium (The Ceiling): The \u00a31bn+ valuation is achieved when a predator applies a much higher premium for strategic control. A predator benefits significantly by acquiring now to gain a market and IP monopoly: o\tIntuitive Surgical (The Integration Gap): Intuitive dominates robotic surgery but has historically relied on third-party energy tools. Acquiring Creo would allow them to own the entire \"Search & Destroy\" procedure (diagnosis + ablation) \"in a single sitting,\" a major goal for robotic surgery, and integrate Creo's technology like the MicroBlate Flex into its ION and flagship da Vinci platforms. o\tMedtronic (The Vascular \"Heat-Sink\" Gap): Medtronic is a leader in advanced energy with its LigaSure (RF) products. Standard RF ablation is limited by the \"heat-sink\" effect, where blood flow cools tissue and prevents tumor destruction. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy is largely unaffected by blood flow, providing a \"gold standard\" tool for abating tumors in highly vascularized organs like the liver and pancreas where Medtronic's current tools often fall short.

Integration allows for digital tomosynthesis, which corrects for \"CT-to-Body Divergence\" (when the tumor moves as the patient breathes). This ensures the probe stays on target. Robotic Stability: Robotic \"lock-on\" technology achieves a targeting accuracy of 97%, ensuring energy is delivered exactly to the malignancy while sparing healthy surrounding tissue. \u2022\tThe Commercial Maths: A 285% Procedure Revenue Lift (\u00a3): At a market price of \u00a35,700 per probe, the MicroBlate Flex transforms the economics of the robotic suite. A standard diagnostic biopsy generates ~\u00a32,000 in disposables. Adding the \u00a35,700 MicroBlate probe brings the total disposable revenue to \u00a37,700 per patient\u2014a 285% increase in revenue per robotic session. TAM Expansion (The Inoperable Market): For the 20% of lung cancer patients too frail for the \"gold standard\" surgery, this combination is the only curative-intent option, massively expanding the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Growth Potential: At a moderate adoption rate of 50,000 procedures annually, probe sales alone generate \u00a3285,000,000 in high-margin recurring revenue. \u2022\tScaling to the Flagship: The \"da Vinci\" Factor: The most significant upside is the potential migration of MicroBlate Flex to the flagship da Vinci platform, which has an installed base of over 11,100 systems globally. This dramatically expands access to the global lung cancer market (an estimated 2.5m new cases annually). The \u00a31 Billion Opportunity: If utilized in just 10% of these annual lung cancer cases, the recurring revenue potential from the probe alone exceeds \u00a31.4 Billion annually. \u2022\tThe Buyout Logic: A Strategic Necessity for Intuitive: As the 2026 commercial rollout accelerates, a buyout of Creo Medical by Intuitive Surgical is seen as a strategic imperative. Monopoly Defense: There is currently no other validated microwave probe that fits the Ion\u2019s ultra-thin architecture. Intuitive must own the technology to prevent rivals from acquiring it. Margin Capture: Intuitive currently \"leaves money on the table\" by sharing the \u00a35,700 probe revenue. By acquiring Creo and the Kamaptive energy platform, Intuitive captures 100% of the profit and fully integrates \"Search & Destroy\" into its global surgical ecosystem.

Furthermore, Micro-Tech together with other companies will ultimately be our manufacturing partner, moving significant product volume away from exclusive in-house manufacturing over the next few years. Partnering with Micro-Tech\u2014the market leader in China with a 30% share\u2014gives Creo 'best-in-class' access to NMPA (China's FDA) registrations. As Micro-Tech aggressively grows the business by bringing in new products at factory prices, the stake transforms into a high-yield dividend engine. We already saw the start of this in the FY25 Interims, which recognized a \u00a30.4m profit share from the associate; significantly, this only covered a partial 4.5-month period following the deal completion in February. As this annualizes and scales, we are sitting on a significant share of future cashflows that the market is overlooking. \u2022\tThe Debt 'Safety Valve' (A Self-Funding Model): We need to secure a managed drawdown facility as a pure safety net, where interest is only paid on funds actually deployed. This facility is expected to be used as a last resort, satisfying market and investor doubts to completely price out the risk of dilution. Crucially, the cost of setting up this 'belt and braces' facility could/should be covered by the cashflows and dividends from the 49% stake in Creo Medical Europe. This creates a Win-Win-Win-Win: 1. We keep the strategic 49% asset and ride its growing value; 2. We eliminate the threat of dilution; 3. We trigger a massive Share Price re-rating by proving the 'funding gap' is permanently closed; 4. We protect and enhance the Predator Premium. 4. The \"Search & Destroy\" Revolution: MicroBlate Flex + Intuitive Robotics \u2022\tClinical Proof: Challenging the Surgical Gold Standard: While traditional surgery remains the established gold standard for lung cancer, MicroBlate Flex is the leading \"Emerging Challenger\" backed by microscopic evidence. Analysis from \"ablate and and resect\" studies at Amsterdam UMC and Royal Brompton Hospital has confirmed 100% complete cell death in treated tumors. This provides the \"ground truth\" that microwave energy matches the tumor-killing efficacy of a scalpel. The \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Unlike older technologies, MicroBlate\u2019s microwave energy is not \"cooled down\" by nearby blood vessels. This ensures a predictable and uniform kill zone in the highly vascular environment of the lung. Superior Safety: Early data continues to show 0% procedure-related mortality for MicroBlate Flex, compared to the 2.1% mortality rate historically associated with traditional surgical resection.

Based on general market perception and discussions across various message boards, the SP is anchored at ~14p due to perceived 'red flags' in the interim balance sheet and the legacy of past results. However, I believe this sentiment is anchored in the past, and that these same points are actually the primary indicators of the upcoming re-rating:\" 1. The \u00a3160M Loss & the 'Hidden' DTA Regarding the Deferred Tax Asset (DTA). The accountants\u2019 'wait-and-see' approach is a lagging indicator. Creo has over \u00a3160M in accumulated losses; when you apply the UK's 25% corporation tax rate to these losses, it results in a potential \u00a340M tax saving. Once we hit the NICE Mandate inflection point and move toward PBT profitability, that \u00a340m asset could be recognized. That would be a massive, non-cash boost to the NAV (Net Asset Value) currently priced at zero. 2. Conservative Accounting vs. IP Reality The ~\u00a30.5m Intangible Asset figure is a massive 'bull' point. Because management expensed the R&D, the balance sheet looks 'empty.' In reality, we have 400+ patents that would cost a 'Big Dog' hundreds of millions to replicate. The current pipeline of devices is just the beginning; a next generation CROMA system or another market-disrupting device is expected to come from this robust R&D pipeline. In addition to other companies the partnership with Micro-Tech also allows us to use them as an outsourced design and development house for a broader range of more commoditized high volume devices such as the bipolar snare and bipolar knife. We are essentially buying world-class IP for pennies because of the accounting treatment. We are competing on physics, not price. The Kamaptive platform is the only tech that miniaturizes microwave and RF energy into a single, tiny device. This creates a significant \"Technical Moat\": \u2022\tThe \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Competitors use RF energy, which often fails in highly vascularized tissue (lung/liver) because blood flow cools the area. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy avoids this, making it the superior clinical tool. 3. The 'Fortress Balance Sheet' & Creo Medical Europe (CME) MicroTech JV Growth \u2022\tMicro-Tech as a Growth Engine: We are sitting on an asset that is worth \u00a326.9m (the book value of the remaining 49% stake in Creo Medical Europe), which is a massive amount for an AIM company of this market cap. We should move away from seeing the 49% stake as just a 'Safety Valve.' Its value has likely increased considerably due to the powerful strategic alignment. Micro-Tech is arguably the best possible partner to access the huge and complicated Chinese market. Disclaimer:  These are personal thoughts & opinions based on publicly available info.

It wont be perfect but even trying to do it makes you think about the critical issues and how they are doing against those value drivers. I cross checked my own valuation with that used by Prof. Damodaran and using that model (10 years discrete forecast) it gives me 43p, so i think 40-50p is a reasonable current estimate. Based on my \u00a326M Rev in FY 28, that would be 8x Rev. Obviously, if they can step up the Rev growth from the 50-60% area to 75-100% for next few years, that changes things quite dramtically, adds c.20p.",

Been to an AGM (I live close to chepstow, met Kevin Crofton seemed decent (as did Craig) but I'm not going to judge on that. I've worked in a similar industry and have a decent understanding of the products. My thoughts are thus 1) They hit their targets for the first time in the recent TU. Great, but one swallow doesn't make a summer etc. 2) They are happy with the forecasts for this year - after only 3 weeks. Great to have confidence. FY forecasts is something like 11-12m, the two brokers (Edison/Cavendish) have differing forecasts. Thats roughly double last years sales. 3) If they hit that and keep costs under control then the company is much closer to being viable. I'd be interested to know \"like for like\" headcount now vs 2025. The costs didn't drop as much as I expected. Prove we can get close then other sources of funding may become available. 4) The timescale for NICE take up will be slower than mentioned. The way that the Croma platform works is different to standard procedures and requires some training. Its needs a few days training and some hand holding and can't be adopted overnight. The last thing you'd want to hear before going under is the surgeon asking \"what does this button do\" :-) 5) US adoption will be key. Thats not going to happen until 2027 due to the reimbursement happening then. 6) I'm hoping for some more clinical results this year and next, hopefully getting Intuitive more involved and promoting it on their Ion Endoluminal system. That would be a huge installed base to bring on board. As I've said here and elsewhere I think these results may be an inflection point. I hope so, I have a large position thats somewhat underwater. I've not added to my position (clearly I should have traded, but thats not my style). Hopefully they will keep the market up to date more regularly to show they are on track. If they are at HY I'll probably buy more.",

Thankfully, we only bought in over the last 12 months or so as my biggest issue with any management team is raising money at 24p and subsequently watching the price go under 10p. They of course will say that is not something they control but I disagree. Great management teams understand the importance of building momentum and always delivering, over and over again, on what you guide. The price chart of Creo sends a very strong message to management (and they have been the same people) on how they have done so far. Lets not forget this is a tiny company trying to bark with the big dogs and yes while it may have hundreds of patents it is interesting to me that most of the expenditure has been expenses. If it was so enduring surely it would have been capitalised. Their capitalised IA is \u00a30.7M as at June, insignificant really. From June to Dec the cash burn has been just under \u00a38m, \u00a36.3M on receipt of the available for sale. They are running out of things to sell. They do have another tax receivable of \u00a32.9M but after that, they are just left with Medtech. On this entity they dont need to tie capital in this entity, they can achieve what they need with a contractual relationship and a smaller \"good faith\" equity stake. At the end of the day at 49% they are still out voted. If there is some other reason for retaining 49% they should be explicit about it.

Regarding the cash flow and the Europe stake, I think our risk appetites might differ slightly: 1.\tThe Cash Position: We finished FY25 with \u00a312.4m cash. Management expects to reach self-sustaining cash flows, and with the current burn rate narrowing rapidly, the bridge to profitability is shorter than the market thinks. 2.\tThe Non-Dilutive Options: Equity funding below 24p would be incredibly difficult to justify. This is why a managed drawdown facility is such a strong option. Securing credit is a strategic 'Fortress Balance Sheet' move; it\u2019s not about intending to spend the cash, but having it available removes the 'smell of a raise' and signals external banking confidence in the 2027 numbers. 3.\tMicroTech as a Strategic Asset: We should move away from seeing the 49% MicroTech stake as just a 'backstop.' It's a high-value strategic asset that strengthens the group valuation. Having \u20ac30m of value locked in a performing associate is a luxury most AIM peers simply don't have. The Bigger Picture: Ultimately, while we debate the cash flow, we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the scarcity of this asset. We are looking at a company with 400+ patents and an energy platform that has already been validated by a global titan like Intuitive Surgical. With the NICE Mandate [GID-MT602] landing in Nov 2026, we are transitioning from 'disruptive tech' to a legally mandated standard of care in the NHS. That shift\u2014combined with 100% margin royalties starting to ramp\u2014is the perfect storm for a significant re-rating. At 14p/15p, the market is pricing in the historical 'struggle' while completely ignoring the imminent commercial explosion. The J-curve is coming; I\u2019m happy to wait for the guidance to confirm it.

The MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) is backed by specific legal and contractual requirements. Here is what happens if an NHS unit refuses to comply: 1.\tContractual Breach: The NHS Standard Contract is the legally binding document between commissioners (ICBs) and providers (Trusts). General Condition 2.2 explicitly mandates compliance with MTFM guidance. Refusal to fund Speedboat would constitute a breach of contract, allowing the commissioner to withhold payments or issue a formal 'Contract Query.' 2.\tFinancial Penalties: Under the NHS System Oversight Framework, NHS England monitors 'efficiency and productivity.' Since Speedboat is proven by NICE to be cost-saving (saving ~\u00a35k per procedure), a Trust that refuses to adopt it is intentionally wasting taxpayer money. This can lead to a 'Requires Improvement' rating, which triggers direct intervention from NHS England and can impact the Trust\u2019s future capital allocations. 3.\tThe '90-Day' Legal Clock: The Health and Social Care Act creates a statutory obligation to make funding available within 90 days of a NICE publication. Patients and clinicians can legally challenge a Trust that fails to provide a mandated, cost-saving treatment. 4.\tNo Local Veto: The MTFM Policy Guidance is clear: local 'affordability' is not an excuse. Because the technology is cost-saving, the policy is designed to overcome the very barriers people are worried about. So, while some Trusts might be slow, they cannot simply say 'no' without facing serious regulatory and financial consequences.

          "content": "Senator1 Excellent analysis and fair points raised. The math on the \u00a330m PBT breakeven at 60% GP is a solid baseline, but I believe it overlooks three critical 'accelerants' that pull that date into 2027: 1.\tThe NICE Mandate J-Curve: I\u2019ve factored in a deployment lag here. The Nov 2026 Mandate [GID-MT602] requires NHS commissioners to provide funding within 90 days of publication. So while the mandate drops in November, the enforceable revenue flow is guaranteed to start by Feb 2027. This timeline is built into the Jan 2027 profitability projection, turning linear adoption into a mandated surge by Q1 2027. 2.\tThe 'Giant' Validation & Royalty Layer: The \u00a330m model typically assumes standard 60% margins on physical hardware. It completely overlooks the Kamaptive licensing flow. When giants like Intuitive Surgical (ION) and CMR Surgical sign up for our energy solution, they validate it as Best-in-Class. These deals provide virtually 100% margin royalty income, which drops straight to the bottom line, shortening the path to PBT breakeven. Furthermore, with 400+ patents protecting the core IP, it's highly likely more 'Giants' will follow to avoid being left behind. 3.\tThe 17-Year Salary Metric: Chairman Kevin Crofton is paid ~\u00a365k/year, yet has put \u00a31.1m of his own post-tax cash into this. He has effectively invested 17 years of his salary back into the company. A man who delivered a $2.3bn exit at SPTS isn't betting on a 2029 crawl; he is positioned for the 2026/27 inflection point. You are absolutely right: Guidance for 2026 on results day will be key. We need management to shift their narrative from qualitative statements ('encouraging momentum') to quantitative metrics ('procedures per site') to show that this J-curve is real. We are all waiting for that clarity. The 2029 projection is a 'linear' view of a company hitting a 'regulatory and royalty' turbocharger. At 14p, the market is pricing in the history but ignoring the imminent mandate and the high-margin royalty ramping.

I hold 1,315,000 CREO shares. 3. The Math: The Path to Profitability (The J-Curve) The \"Bear Case\" relies on historical cash burn, but the numbers show we have hit the inflection point. This is driven by Operational Leverage: \u2022\tRevenue Velocity: FY25 H2 revenue surged 58% to \u00a33.8m. \u2022\tCost Discipline: Underlying OpEx was \"right-sized\" with a 20% reduction to \u00a318.4m. \u2022\tThe Logic: The company does not need to cut further; it simply needs to grow into its fixed cost base. As revenue scales toward a \u00a325m\u2013\u00a330m run-rate* (fueled by the NICE mandate and robotic royalties), the stable cost base allows Gross Profits to bridge the gap. Mathematically, the \"crossover point\" to self-sustaining cash flow is visible by late 2026/Jan 2027. \u2022\t*Note: Revenue run-rate figures are forward-looking projections based on the current 58% H2 growth trajectory and 60% target margins. 4. The \u00a31bn+ Buyout Potential Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p, with a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) suggested by Edison Group analysts once profitability is proven. \u2022\tM&A Logic: High-growth, high-IP MedTech carries a 10x revenue multiple. As Creo approaches a \u00a3100m run-rate, a \u00a31bn+ valuation is entirely consistent with sector precedents (e.g., Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $13.1bn Shockwave acquisition). Summary: I believe the stock is deeply undervalued and waiting for the market to price in the \"J-curve.\" For those underwater, the disconnect between the ~14.5p price and the 24p insider floor represents a significant opportunity.",

TL;DR Summary: \u2022\tInsane Entry Price: Buying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s anchor investment (24p). \u2022\tThe NICE Catalyst: NICE hand-picked Speedboat to optimize NHS resources; legal mandate for funding expected Nov 19, 2026. \u2022\tTechnical Moat: Only tech to beat the \"heat-sink\" effect in lung/liver; 400+ patent moat. \u2022\tThe Math: 58% H2 revenue growth hitting a stabilized cost base makes a Jan 2027 breakeven a mathematical probability. Full Analysis: The current share price of ~14.5p is fundamentally broken and presents an absurd disconnect from operational reality. For private investors with a 12-24 month view, this is a classic \"inflection point\" setup. 1. The Technology Moat: Why it's \"Best-in-Class\" Creo isn't competing on price; they're competing on physics. Their Kamaptive platform is the only tech that miniaturizes microwave and RF energy into a single, tiny device. \u2022\tThe \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Competitors use RF energy, which fails in highly vascularized tissue (lung/liver) because blood flow cools the area (the \"heat-sink effect\"). Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy avoids this, making it the superior clinical tool. \u2022\tThe NICE Selection: NICE specifically selected Speedboat Inject because they identified it as a key technology to ensure the \"best use of NHS resources.\" \u2022\tProven Savings: Real-world data showed the Speedboat procedure reduced hospital stays from 8.4 days to 1.1 days, saving the NHS nearly \u00a35,000 per procedure. 2. The Insider Signal: A Valuation Floor Chairman Kevin Crofton, who delivered a $2.3bn exit at his last company, put over \u00a31 million of his own cash into CREO in 2024/2025. \u2022\tHis initial anchor entry was 24p (\u00a3700k invested). \u2022\tBuying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s primary entry price.

The incredible thing is you make the decision and a month letter you are wondering why you ever had the 10 to 20% in the first place. Creo cannot raise more money, so every pound they have now should be treated like gold dust, R & D pruned to the bone, the focus sales, sales, sales. No hiring, no pay increases, haircuts for the board, all obvious and urgent stuff. It is extremely frustrating. Without urgent measures the company will not survive in its present form.

A broader range of devices (several commercial launches), potential future licensing opportunities for robotics (Kamaptive tech), and optionality with Micro-Tech, should underpin this path to break-even and beyond, while being well funded through to 2027.",

CMD takeaways: Market drivers intact: Large TAM of which it is focusing on a smaller portion ($1.5bn SAM). Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics.

The losses have only narrowed slightly, sales numbers have consistently come in like tales of the unexpected. 2028 is far far away, a kind of wishful fantasy where words mean what we want them to mean.

For the first time they have actually met their sales forecasts and are confident of hitting them this year (12m, so 100% increase). If they can do that it will show they have a commercially viable product that they are capable of selling. if they hit sales everything else should fall into line. Not without risk and not going to be easy but I'm not selling (or buying). I think there should some LSE rules - can't issue options below any funding price of the last 3 years, can't take up more shares than their current (market purchased) holdings, can't issue more than 5% in the company in any year.  I've never believed LTIPs incentivise management, show me one CEO thats says he's not going to bother if he can't have free shares.",

Furthermore I needed separate visits for an endoscopy. Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages. Being opened up from the outside also introduces more risk of picking up an infection. What Creo enables, especially in treatment of lung and pancreatic cancer, feels like Dr Bones Star Trek stuff.",

I almost never look at threads of shares I don't hold  - and I'm pretty sure that 9 out 10 who read this will be holders (and I don't think bears make a great deal of difference). The most successful ramps I have seen are with RC365/Woodbois/Mast Energy illiquid minnows (look at their charts) and these have been promoted through false news/financial websites. Not a big user of youtube,  I do like investor meets though if you have seen them. As for NICE I have looked through the latest Cavendish note and there is no mention of it. The management have always said they haven't allowed for any kamaptive (3rd party) sales and I *think* the same applies to NICE. Certainly no sales this year. Of course NICE is a help, they can sell to the NHS without it. For me  - that they hit 2025 sales targets and are confident of meeting this years shows that they have finally got traction and hopefully their forecasts aren't the fantasy that they have previously been. Getting a partnership and takeoff in the US/China could dwarf any UK sales. For me this has been a poor investment, but I still have faith it can be a success. Its not been a smooth road but I think the TU was pivotal. Time will tell, but good luck with whatever you decide.",

I'm still learning to distinguish between genuine posters with original thoughts, however non-consensual, and AI-driven ones, that come across as all -knowing, reasoned commentaries.  They pop up all over the place these days. For example, as a Gold and Silver bug, using YouTube increasingly, I and many other experienced investors were taken in by a certain \"Asian_Guy\" , who seemed very knowledgeable and posted stuff that was about 80% right, but then added spurious sensationalist stuff that fitted his/her agenda but was subsequently shown to be simply made up. I was initially taken in by Equitable, as a reasonable pov. And this guy may have 1.5mn shares in Creo. I have no idea if this is true. But as I delve more deeply into Creo, I am naturally inclined to try and see all sides of the investment case, and that means wondering  if the NICE timeline might slip from November. And also wondering if Creo has built in a margin of safety for Trusts not taking up the  ESD knife product within a short time frame due to individual Trust's bureaucracy, budgets or Specialists' resistance for whatever reason. If asking these questions in all sincerity in a public forum is deemed to be a negativity, then that reflects more on the responder than the questioner, in my opinion. Not my problem. I just look for knowledgeable posters willing to spend a few minutes of their time to broaden my knowledge base about Creo, and in so doing, help to spread the word to a wider audience, as I admit I have not come across Creo up until now. My sole biotech investment is Avacta. Sorry for the long reply. I am interested and willing to read up on the tech, and Creo's place in this rapidly expanding market segment. And then there is the issue of management, which I have read about from certain posters, given the tortuous road travelled over the past few years in the stockmarket.  For another day, perhaps....",

Secondly, its not their robotic sytem that is up for appraisal. Thirdly the core product sales forecast for this year is c11m, thats about 70%. This excludes NICE approval as even if it does happen on time it won't make any difference to this years sales. Whilst a positive outcome will undoubtedly help its not the be all and end all.

The Partial Collateral Valve: Creo retains a 49% stake in its European business\u2014a division valued at over \u00a360m (\u20ac72m). As a safety valve, the company has the option to partially secure debt against a percentage of this asset. This 'Surgical Financing' provides a non-dilutive bridge to breakeven while the asset continues to grow in value and generate profit shares. 2. The 'Drain' is Narrowing Fast: The January 2026 trading update confirmed the strategy is working. Management has slashed underlying operating losses by over 40% to \u00a313.3m, with revenue up 50%. With \u00a312.4m cash already in the bank and operating costs falling by 20%, the march to cash-flow breakeven is now a visible commercial reality. 3. Systemic Mandate (Streeting Reforms): Health Secretary Wes Streeting\u2019s new reforms\u2014including NHS League Tables and tying Trust funding to productivity\u2014are designed specifically to force the adoption of cost-saving tech like Speedboat\u2122 Inject. The delay isn't a lack of data; it\u2019s a systemic lag that the government is now mandating to be cleared. 4. Market Momentum: The share price has already climbed from 14p to 17.75p in just the last week (a 24.5% rise). The market is starting to see that 14p was a survival-mode valuation, but the reality of 2026 is a company with a protected balance sheet and massive strategic value. Management has the non-dilutive levers to reach the finish line. Disclaimer:  These are personal thoughts & opinions based on publicly available info. Not financial advice.

I just dont think you will get a lender to lend a material amount against it, particularly as Creo dont decide the cashflow (the DVD). i wouldnt want them to borrow on that basis either as if they fell out with Med Tech they are in trouble as they could cut the DVD off quite easily. As a loan, the only way I would take any value from it is if Med_Tech itself lent the money and did so on a limited recourse basis, limited to the cashflow from the DVD, so no general recourse. The market would not value a straight third party loan in the way you think, it would be a negative. The only other sensible way to monetise it is via a further partial sale if that becomes necessary. My cashflow projections suggest it will be very tight as I am pretty sure dealing with NHS type entities will be working capital intensive. If they came to some sort of licencing agreement with Intuitive which had an upfront cash payment, that would also work. Management have said they have the resources to get to cashflow breakeven, given their history, I think they have not made that statement lightly and so hopefully a further sale of the 49% is not needed. However, I would encourage management to explain in detail their calculations on this critical aspect. In fact, I would want Crofton to lead the discussion on this, not the CFO.",

The \"Hybrid\" Victory: Ion + da Vinci Creo is uniquely positioned as the first and only partner to provide a dual-energy (RF/Microwave) platform for both of Intuitive\u2019s flagship robots: Internal Ablation (Ion) via MicroBlate Flex and External Resection (da Vinci) via SpydrBlade Flex. Integrated into the da Vinci platform (10,000+ units globally), Creo is becoming a universal surgical energy standard. 6. Strategic Certainty and the Inevitable Exit At a share price of ~14p and a market cap of roughly \u00a350m, the valuation disconnect is profound. Considering Creo received ~\u00a325m in cash for its European stake, the market effectively values the global IP and robotic partnerships at zero. As robotic and non-invasive surgery becomes the global default, a total buyout by a MedTech giant becomes a strategic certainty. Entities with the cash and the need include: \u2022\tIntuitive Surgical: Seeking a \"closed-loop\" system to capture high-margin consumable revenue. \u2022\tJohnson & Johnson (J&J MedTech): Needing an energy suite for their Ottava\u2122 platform. \u2022\tMedtronic: Looking to replace aging ablation tech with Creo\u2019s precision range. \u2022\tOlympus Corporation: Transitioning from a \"camera company\" into a \"robotic treatment company.\" The technology is on a superb global flight path for both patients and shareholders. For those who see past the noise, Creo represents a foundational opportunity at the start of a global surgical revolution.

          "content": "Part 1 of 2 The Global Robotic Infrastructure: Why the \u00a31.25bn Lung Pillar is Just the Foundation of Creo\u2019s Value Realisation 1. The Macro Catalyst: Wes Streeting, Prof. Shah, and the NICE Pipeline On January 20, 2026, Health Secretary Wes Streeting visited Royal Brompton Hospital, hosted by Professor Pallav Shah and NHS England CEO Amanda Pritchard. Streeting hailed the robotic \"one-stop-shop\" lung procedure as \"the future of the NHS.\" This momentum is backed by a critical regulatory driver: Speedboat\u2122 Inject is under formal NICE assessment, with guidance expected by November 2026. By February 2026, NHS Trusts are preparing business cases to trigger the MedTech Funding Mandate; once NICE approves a cost-saving device, the NHS is legally obliged to fund and adopt it, clearing the path for a rapid revenue surge across the UK\u2019s 350+ hospitals. 2. From Keyhole to Non-Invasive (The Endoluminal Revolution) While the market focus is on robotic \"keyhole\" surgery, Creo\u2019s technology is enabling a shift toward totally non-invasive, incisionless treatment. By using the body\u2019s natural pathways\u2014the airways for lungs and the GI tract for bowel/stomach cancers\u2014Creo allows clinicians to biopsy and ablate tumors without a single external cut. This endoluminal approach reduces recovery times from weeks to hours and is the primary reason clinicians like Professor Pallav Shah describe this as a generational breakthrough. 3. Regulatory Dominance vs. Clinical Adoption (The Data Moat) The core suite\u2014Speedboat, MicroBlate, SlypSeal, and SpydrBlade\u2014already holds CE Mark and FDA Clearance. Ongoing trials are building the Economic Evidence Base, proving Creo\u2019s tech is safer and cheaper than traditional surgery. Real-world NHS data showing that Speedboat\u2122 Inject saves approximately \u00a35,000 per procedure (equating to \u00a3687k per Trust) is foundational to the NICE review. This \"Data Moat\" creates a massive barrier to entry that competitors would require years of clinical data to replicate. 4. The \"Ion\" Maths: A \u00a31.25bn Revenue Pillar (MicroBlate Flex Alone) Lung cancer accounts for 2.2 million new cases annually. The potential for MicroBlate Flex (at ~\u00a35,700 per disposable) represents a massive untapped upside: \u2022\tApproved Base Case (US, EU, UK, Ex-China APAC): ~1.14m new cases p.a. A 10% adoption rate represents a \u00a3650 million annual recurring revenue path. \u2022\tChina Multiplier: Adding China\u2019s ~1.06m cases via the Micro-Tech partnership jumps the potential to \u00a31.25 billion annually.

Securing a debt facility against the 49% stake, or by other means, acts as a critical safety valve. It sends a clear message to the market that the risk of further dilution is effectively off the table and that Creo is fully funded to act without being forced into an equity raise. Given the growth trajectory and the massive inherent value of the Kamaptive technology, lenders are looking at the 'Tech value' and buyout potential, which provides a much more significant cushion than a simple cash-flow analysis of the European arm. Ultimately, as the core business scales and we hit our stride globally, that 49% stake will eventually look like 'chicken feed' compared to the value of the main enterprise. We are holding it now for leverage and strategic optionality, ensuring that any future moves are made from a position of absolute strength.",

Predator Urgency & the \u00a31bn+ Valuation: The Path to Re-rating The current share price of ~14p fundamentally ignores the true strategic value of Creo's assets. A predator's (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, CMR Surgical) interest is in long-term, multi-billion-dollar market access and IP, not today's P&L statement. The path to a \u00a31bn+ valuation uses M&A math, which is different from standard analyst forecasts: \u2022\tAnalyst Price Targets (The Floor): Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p. Edison Group analysts suggested a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) once profitability is proven. This is the market's current conservative \"floor\". \u2022\tThe M&A Strategic Premium (The Ceiling): The \u00a31bn+ valuation is achieved when a predator applies a much higher premium for strategic control. A predator benefits significantly by acquiring now to gain a market and IP monopoly: o\tIntuitive Surgical (The Integration Gap): Intuitive dominates robotic surgery but has historically relied on third-party energy tools. Acquiring Creo would allow them to own the entire \"Search & Destroy\" procedure (diagnosis + ablation) \"in a single sitting,\" a major goal for robotic surgery, and integrate Creo's technology like the MicroBlate Flex into its ION and flagship da Vinci platforms. o\tMedtronic (The Vascular \"Heat-Sink\" Gap): Medtronic is a leader in advanced energy with its LigaSure (RF) products. Standard RF ablation is limited by the \"heat-sink\" effect, where blood flow cools tissue and prevents tumor destruction. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy is largely unaffected by blood flow, providing a \"gold standard\" tool for abating tumors in highly vascularized organs like the liver and pancreas where Medtronic's current tools often fall short. This is achieved using the world\u2019s only 19-gauge less than 1mm) microwave ablation needle, MicroBlate Fine, the only device thin enough to destroy pancreatic and liver tumors internally via standard Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS), avoiding invasive surgery. o\tBoston Scientific (High-Growth Adjacency): Boston Scientific has an established position in interventional oncology and is actively pursuing acquisitions to expand into new high-growth segments and compete with Medtronic. Creo's unique energy platform and product pipeline perfectly align with BSX's strategy of M&A for \"high-growth adjacency\" markets where they have a limited presence today. o\tCMR Surgical (Robotic Energy Gap): CMR is a major global player in robotic surgery with its Versius system. Their primary focus is on the robotic platform itself rather than advanced energy tools. They have a licensing agreement with Creo; an acquisition would allow them to own \"best-in-class\" energy and prevent competitors from doing the same.

But my view is that we are at the precipice of 'Creo Future,' where the RNS transparency improves, some of the IP value is unlocked by the NICE mandate (which is a 'when' not an 'if'), and we hit the J-curve. I hold a very high conviction that the current price fundamentally undervalues the company's prospects. The company is now firmly moving from an R&D entity to a commercial one. Time will tell if management finally delivers, but the data points for a turnaround are stronger than ever. The current share price of ~14p is a reflection of the analyst consensus, combined with high market perception of risk, a liquidity discount, and widespread assumption of future dilution. This entirely ignores the intrinsic value of the \u00a326.9m stake and its cash-generative benefits from the Creo Medical Europe (CME) joint venture, which solidify our 'Fortress Balance Sheet'. My 'J-curve' analysis is ahead of this curve; I believe our (self-funding debt/dividend model from CME) will accelerate profitability by December 2027, closing that valuation gap rapidly and commanding a premium for completely removing the doubt of dilution and reflecting the high probability of a predator buyout. The additional, pure-profit royalty payments (Intuitive/CMR), the MicroBlate Flex US commercial opportunity including da Vinci integration, the new MicroBlate Fine catalyst, and the bipolar range (Speedboat, SpydrBlade, etc.) further support this timeline to December 2027, and \u201cwith a little bit of wind in our sails we could be quiet ahead of that\u201d. Ultimately, let's not forget that beyond the balance sheet, Creo\u2019s technology is changing and saving people's lives every day. That is the most enduring value of all.

External DCF Models Reinforce the Undervaluation The argument for undervaluation extends beyond internal analysis: even external, conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) models consistently produce a share price far exceeding the current ~14p. Some private valuations on boards using robust models have even placed fair value around 43p based on conservative \u00a326m revenue estimates for FY28. \u2022\tConservative Estimates: Independent models using a high WACC (15%) and a subjective \"UK discount\" still arrive at a share price valuation between 47p and 55p. \u2022\tThe Disconnect: This substantial gap highlights the market's current fixation on \"risk\" and \"past performance.\" These models reinforce the argument that the fundamental, de-risked value of the company is already three to four times the current share price. \u2022\tMissing the \"J-Curve\" Catalysts: Standard DCF models struggle to accurately price in the rapid adoption that catalysts like the US CPT code will cause.

Royalty Streams (Pure Profit) & MicroBlate Flex \u2018The Wind in Our Sails\u2019 It is critical to remember that both commercial sales and licensing agreements represent a significant amount of \"wind in our sails\" and high-margin potential. \u2022\tMicroBlate Flex (Commercial Sales): The lung device is purchased commercially for an estimated \u00a35,700 per unit. Revenue from this has a margin well over 60%. Importantly, it is already being sold commercially on an individual basis at the Royal Brompton Hospital. A total of six sites are expected to run in the UK and Europe under the Pioneer Programme to gather clinical evidence ahead of a full commercial launch. A further 1 site is expected to go commercial sales in H1-26. The device is also approved for use in the USA, where the market presents a substantial opportunity for growth. The Intuitive ION partnership also has the potential for expanded scope into the high-growth APAC market. Intuitive Surgical recently announced its FY25 results, stating that ION procedures grew c51% in the year. This procedure growth highlights the immense potential of the US lung tumor opportunity, which is currently not factored into most P&L analyst reports.

The NHS / NICE Mandate: The \"Streeting Factor\" & High Probability of Rapid Adoption This isn't just about clinical guidelines; it's about a legal and political mandate for funding that creates a perfect storm for rapid adoption. For independent verification, you can review the official NICE project page for the Creo Speedboat (GID-MT602) here: www.nice.org.uk. \u2022\tThe NICE Catalyst: NICE hand-picked Speedboat to optimize NHS resources; a legal mandate for funding is expected around November 19, 2026. \u2022\tProven Savings: Real-world data showed the Speedboat procedure reduced hospital stays from 8.4 days to 1.1 days, saving the NHS nearly \u00a35,000 per procedure. \u2022\tThe \"Streeting Factor\" (Why Enforcement is Guaranteed): Wes Streeting has explicitly stated the NHS must 'reform or die,' tying future funding to productivity gains. Under this 'Value for Money' framework, a Trust refusing to adopt a NICE-mandated, cost-saving technology like Speedboat isn't just ignoring a guideline\u2014they are actively defying the government\u2019s core strategy. This creates: o\tContractual & Legal Breach: The NHS Standard Contract mandates compliance with the MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM). Refusal is a breach of contract with financial penalties. o\tNo Local Veto: The MTFM policy is clear: local 'affordability' is not an excuse because the tech is proven to be cost-saving. o\tThe 90-Day Clock: The Health and Social Care Act creates a statutory obligation for funding to be available within 90 days of a NICE publication. By February 2027, the adoption of Creo's technology isn't just expected\u2014it is contractually and legally mandated, acting as a massive 'adoption accelerator.'

The disconnect between Kevin Crofton\u2019s \u00a31.1m personal investment and the current ~14p price provides a clear valuation floor. Since joining in July 2024, he has purchased over \u00a31 million in shares using his own funds, signaling a commitment far beyond his \u00a364k annual fee. His initial anchor entry was 24p (\u00a3700k invested), meaning the current price is a 40% discount to his main entry point. A man who delivered a $2.3bn exit at SPTS did not invest his own capital to wait for a distant FY28/FY29 timeline. He is signaling the 2026/2027 rapid inflection point is imminent. This signal reinforces my personal high conviction in this company. The AMA CPT reimbursement code is a key part of this inflection point. Physicians who may earn $300 for a standard colonoscopy could earn over $1,000 for the procedures Speedboat enables. This massive financial incentive for the US private market will encourage rapid training and adoption as the code comes into effect in January 2027. Furthermore, the NICE Catalyst is another powerful accelerator. A legal mandate for funding is expected around November 19, 2026. This was based on real-world data showing significant reductions in hospital stays and costs per procedure. Wes Streeting's political pressure makes this a powerful adoption accelerator.

Predator Urgency & the \u00a31bn+ Valuation: The Path to Re-rating The current share price of ~14p fundamentally ignores the true strategic value of Creo's assets. A predator's (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, CMR Surgical) interest is in long-term, multi-billion-dollar market access and IP, not today's P&L statement. The path to a \u00a31bn+ valuation uses M&A math, which is different from standard analyst forecasts: \u2022\tAnalyst Price Targets (The Floor): Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p. Edison Group analysts suggested a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) once profitability is proven. This is the market's current conservative \"floor\". \u2022\tThe M&A Strategic Premium (The Ceiling): The \u00a31bn+ valuation is achieved when a predator applies a much higher premium for strategic control. A predator benefits significantly by acquiring now to gain a market and IP monopoly: o\tIntuitive Surgical (The Integration Gap): Intuitive dominates robotic surgery but has historically relied on third-party energy tools. Acquiring Creo would allow them to own the entire \"Search & Destroy\" procedure (diagnosis + ablation) \"in a single sitting,\" a major goal for robotic surgery, and integrate Creo's technology like the MicroBlate Flex into its ION and flagship da Vinci platforms. o\tMedtronic (The Vascular \"Heat-Sink\" Gap): Medtronic is a leader in advanced energy with its LigaSure (RF) products. Standard RF ablation is limited by the \"heat-sink\" effect, where blood flow cools tissue and prevents tumor destruction. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy is largely unaffected by blood flow, providing a \"gold standard\" tool for abating tumors in highly vascularized organs like the liver and pancreas where Medtronic's current tools often fall short.

Integration allows for digital tomosynthesis, which corrects for \"CT-to-Body Divergence\" (when the tumor moves as the patient breathes). This ensures the probe stays on target. Robotic Stability: Robotic \"lock-on\" technology achieves a targeting accuracy of 97%, ensuring energy is delivered exactly to the malignancy while sparing healthy surrounding tissue. \u2022\tThe Commercial Maths: A 285% Procedure Revenue Lift (\u00a3): At a market price of \u00a35,700 per probe, the MicroBlate Flex transforms the economics of the robotic suite. A standard diagnostic biopsy generates ~\u00a32,000 in disposables. Adding the \u00a35,700 MicroBlate probe brings the total disposable revenue to \u00a37,700 per patient\u2014a 285% increase in revenue per robotic session. TAM Expansion (The Inoperable Market): For the 20% of lung cancer patients too frail for the \"gold standard\" surgery, this combination is the only curative-intent option, massively expanding the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Growth Potential: At a moderate adoption rate of 50,000 procedures annually, probe sales alone generate \u00a3285,000,000 in high-margin recurring revenue. \u2022\tScaling to the Flagship: The \"da Vinci\" Factor: The most significant upside is the potential migration of MicroBlate Flex to the flagship da Vinci platform, which has an installed base of over 11,100 systems globally. This dramatically expands access to the global lung cancer market (an estimated 2.5m new cases annually). The \u00a31 Billion Opportunity: If utilized in just 10% of these annual lung cancer cases, the recurring revenue potential from the probe alone exceeds \u00a31.4 Billion annually. \u2022\tThe Buyout Logic: A Strategic Necessity for Intuitive: As the 2026 commercial rollout accelerates, a buyout of Creo Medical by Intuitive Surgical is seen as a strategic imperative. Monopoly Defense: There is currently no other validated microwave probe that fits the Ion\u2019s ultra-thin architecture. Intuitive must own the technology to prevent rivals from acquiring it. Margin Capture: Intuitive currently \"leaves money on the table\" by sharing the \u00a35,700 probe revenue. By acquiring Creo and the Kamaptive energy platform, Intuitive captures 100% of the profit and fully integrates \"Search & Destroy\" into its global surgical ecosystem.

These numbers are currently not baked into Creo\u2019s expectations and guidance to the market. Furthermore, Micro-Tech together with other companies will ultimately be our manufacturing partner, moving significant product volume away from exclusive in-house manufacturing over the next few years. Partnering with Micro-Tech\u2014the market leader in China with a 30% share\u2014gives Creo 'best-in-class' access to NMPA (China's FDA) registrations. As Micro-Tech aggressively grows the business by bringing in new products at factory prices, the stake transforms into a high-yield dividend engine. We already saw the start of this in the FY25 Interims, which recognized a \u00a30.4m profit share from the associate; significantly, this only covered a partial 4.5-month period following the deal completion in February. As this annualizes and scales, we are sitting on a significant share of future cashflows that the market is overlooking. \u2022\tThe Debt 'Safety Valve' (A Self-Funding Model): We need to secure a managed drawdown facility as a pure safety net, where interest is only paid on funds actually deployed. This facility is expected to be used as a last resort, satisfying market and investor doubts to completely price out the risk of dilution. Crucially, the cost of setting up this 'belt and braces' facility could/should be covered by the cashflows and dividends from the 49% stake in Creo Medical Europe. This creates a Win-Win-Win-Win: 1. We keep the strategic 49% asset and ride its growing value; 2. We eliminate the threat of dilution; 3. We trigger a massive Share Price re-rating by proving the 'funding gap' is permanently closed; 4. We protect and enhance the Predator Premium. 4. The \"Search & Destroy\" Revolution: MicroBlate Flex + Intuitive Robotics \u2022\tClinical Proof: Challenging the Surgical Gold Standard: While traditional surgery remains the established gold standard for lung cancer, MicroBlate Flex is the leading \"Emerging Challenger\" backed by microscopic evidence. Analysis from \"ablate and and resect\" studies at Amsterdam UMC and Royal Brompton Hospital has confirmed 100% complete cell death in treated tumors. This provides the \"ground truth\" that microwave energy matches the tumor-killing efficacy of a scalpel. The \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Unlike older technologies, MicroBlate\u2019s microwave energy is not \"cooled down\" by nearby blood vessels. This ensures a predictable and uniform kill zone in the highly vascular environment of the lung. Superior Safety: Early data continues to show 0% procedure-related mortality for MicroBlate Flex, compared to the 2.1% mortality rate historically associated with traditional surgical resection.

Based on general market perception and discussions across various message boards, the SP is anchored at ~14p due to perceived 'red flags' in the interim balance sheet and the legacy of past results. However, I believe this sentiment is anchored in the past, and that these same points are actually the primary indicators of the upcoming re-rating:\" 1. The \u00a3160M Loss & the 'Hidden' DTA Regarding the Deferred Tax Asset (DTA). The accountants\u2019 'wait-and-see' approach is a lagging indicator. Creo has over \u00a3160M in accumulated losses; when you apply the UK's 25% corporation tax rate to these losses, it results in a potential \u00a340M tax saving. Once we hit the NICE Mandate inflection point and move toward PBT profitability, that \u00a340m asset could be recognized. That would be a massive, non-cash boost to the NAV (Net Asset Value) currently priced at zero. 2. Conservative Accounting vs. IP Reality The ~\u00a30.5m Intangible Asset figure is a massive 'bull' point. Because management expensed the R&D, the balance sheet looks 'empty.' In reality, we have 400+ patents that would cost a 'Big Dog' hundreds of millions to replicate. The current pipeline of devices is just the beginning; a next generation CROMA system or another market-disrupting device is expected to come from this robust R&D pipeline. In addition to other companies the partnership with Micro-Tech also allows us to use them as an outsourced design and development house for a broader range of more commoditized high volume devices such as the bipolar snare and bipolar knife. We are essentially buying world-class IP for pennies because of the accounting treatment. We are competing on physics, not price. The Kamaptive platform is the only tech that miniaturizes microwave and RF energy into a single, tiny device. This creates a significant \"Technical Moat\": \u2022\tThe \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Competitors use RF energy, which often fails in highly vascularized tissue (lung/liver) because blood flow cools the area. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy avoids this, making it the superior clinical tool. 3. The 'Fortress Balance Sheet' & Creo Medical Europe (CME) MicroTech JV Growth \u2022\tMicro-Tech as a Growth Engine: We are sitting on an asset that is worth \u00a326.9m (the book value of the remaining 49% stake in Creo Medical Europe), which is a massive amount for an AIM company of this market cap. We should move away from seeing the 49% stake as just a 'Safety Valve.' Its value has likely increased considerably due to the powerful strategic alignment. Micro-Tech is arguably the best possible partner to access the huge and complicated Chinese market. Disclaimer:  These are personal thoughts & opinions based on publicly available info.

It wont be perfect but even trying to do it makes you think about the critical issues and how they are doing against those value drivers.

I just hope for gradual progression and that my investment will eventually come good. At the beginning of this year it was my 2nd worst ever investment (in value terms, I've had a few -100%) and now its up to the dizzy heights of 3rd worst.  Its a company that I have become too emotionally attached to, and thats never a good thing. But I still believe that these results are the end of the very long beginning and its moving from an R&D to a commercial entity.",

Been to an AGM (I live close to chepstow, met Kevin Crofton seemed decent (as did Craig) but I'm not going to judge on that. I've worked in a similar industry and have a decent understanding of the products. My thoughts are thus 1) They hit their targets for the first time in the recent TU. Great, but one swallow doesn't make a summer etc. 2) They are happy with the forecasts for this year - after only 3 weeks. Great to have confidence. FY forecasts is something like 11-12m, the two brokers (Edison/Cavendish) have differing forecasts. Thats roughly double last years sales. 3) If they hit that and keep costs under control then the company is much closer to being viable. I'd be interested to know \"like for like\" headcount now vs 2025. The costs didn't drop as much as I expected. Prove we can get close then other sources of funding may become available. 4) The timescale for NICE take up will be slower than mentioned. The way that the Croma platform works is different to standard procedures and requires some training. Its needs a few days training and some hand holding and can't be adopted overnight. The last thing you'd want to hear before going under is the surgeon asking \"what does this button do\" :-) 5) US adoption will be key. Thats not going to happen until 2027 due to the reimbursement happening then. 6) I'm hoping for some more clinical results this year and next, hopefully getting Intuitive more involved and promoting it on their Ion Endoluminal system. That would be a huge installed base to bring on board. As I've said here and elsewhere I think these results may be an inflection point. I hope so, I have a large position thats somewhat underwater. I've not added to my position (clearly I should have traded, but thats not my style). Hopefully they will keep the market up to date more regularly to show they are on track. If they are at HY I'll probably buy more.",

Thankfully, we only bought in over the last 12 months or so as my biggest issue with any management team is raising money at 24p and subsequently watching the price go under 10p. They of course will say that is not something they control but I disagree. Great management teams understand the importance of building momentum and always delivering, over and over again, on what you guide. The price chart of Creo sends a very strong message to management (and they have been the same people) on how they have done so far. Lets not forget this is a tiny company trying to bark with the big dogs and yes while it may have hundreds of patents it is interesting to me that most of the expenditure has been expenses. If it was so enduring surely it would have been capitalised. Their capitalised IA is \u00a30.7M as at June, insignificant really. From June to Dec the cash burn has been just under \u00a38m, \u00a36.3M on receipt of the available for sale. They are running out of things to sell. They do have another tax receivable of \u00a32.9M but after that, they are just left with Medtech. On this entity they dont need to tie capital in this entity, they can achieve what they need with a contractual relationship and a smaller \"good faith\" equity stake. At the end of the day at 49% they are still out voted. If there is some other reason for retaining 49% they should be explicit about it. From an IR perspective I find them very poor communicators which you only have to look at the share price for an independent view on.",

Regarding the cash flow and the Europe stake, I think our risk appetites might differ slightly: 1.\tThe Cash Position: We finished FY25 with \u00a312.4m cash. Management expects to reach self-sustaining cash flows, and with the current burn rate narrowing rapidly, the bridge to profitability is shorter than the market thinks. 2.\tThe Non-Dilutive Options: Equity funding below 24p would be incredibly difficult to justify. This is why a managed drawdown facility is such a strong option. Securing credit is a strategic 'Fortress Balance Sheet' move; it\u2019s not about intending to spend the cash, but having it available removes the 'smell of a raise' and signals external banking confidence in the 2027 numbers. 3.\tMicroTech as a Strategic Asset: We should move away from seeing the 49% MicroTech stake as just a 'backstop.' It's a high-value strategic asset that strengthens the group valuation. Having \u20ac30m of value locked in a performing associate is a luxury most AIM peers simply don't have. The Bigger Picture: Ultimately, while we debate the cash flow, we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the scarcity of this asset. We are looking at a company with 400+ patents and an energy platform that has already been validated by a global titan like Intuitive Surgical. With the NICE Mandate [GID-MT602] landing in Nov 2026, we are transitioning from 'disruptive tech' to a legally mandated standard of care in the NHS. That shift\u2014combined with 100% margin royalties starting to ramp\u2014is the perfect storm for a significant re-rating. At 14p/15p, the market is pricing in the historical 'struggle' while completely ignoring the imminent commercial explosion. The J-curve is coming; I\u2019m happy to wait for the guidance to confirm it.

          "content": "That is a very common perception, but it's important to distinguish between 'clinical guidelines' and 'funding mandates.' The MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) is backed by specific legal and contractual requirements. Here is what happens if an NHS unit refuses to comply: 1.\tContractual Breach: The NHS Standard Contract is the legally binding document between commissioners (ICBs) and providers (Trusts). General Condition 2.2 explicitly mandates compliance with MTFM guidance. Refusal to fund Speedboat would constitute a breach of contract, allowing the commissioner to withhold payments or issue a formal 'Contract Query.' 2.\tFinancial Penalties: Under the NHS System Oversight Framework, NHS England monitors 'efficiency and productivity.' Since Speedboat is proven by NICE to be cost-saving (saving ~\u00a35k per procedure), a Trust that refuses to adopt it is intentionally wasting taxpayer money. This can lead to a 'Requires Improvement' rating, which triggers direct intervention from NHS England and can impact the Trust\u2019s future capital allocations. 3.\tThe '90-Day' Legal Clock: The Health and Social Care Act creates a statutory obligation to make funding available within 90 days of a NICE publication. Patients and clinicians can legally challenge a Trust that fails to provide a mandated, cost-saving treatment. 4.\tNo Local Veto: The MTFM Policy Guidance is clear: local 'affordability' is not an excuse. Because the technology is cost-saving, the policy is designed to overcome the very barriers people are worried about. So, while some Trusts might be slow, they cannot simply say 'no' without facing serious regulatory and financial consequences. By February 2027, the 'jump' to adopting Creo's technology isn't just expected\u2014it is contractually and legally mandated.

          "content": "Senator1 Excellent analysis and fair points raised. The math on the \u00a330m PBT breakeven at 60% GP is a solid baseline, but I believe it overlooks three critical 'accelerants' that pull that date into 2027: 1.\tThe NICE Mandate J-Curve: I\u2019ve factored in a deployment lag here. The Nov 2026 Mandate [GID-MT602] requires NHS commissioners to provide funding within 90 days of publication. So while the mandate drops in November, the enforceable revenue flow is guaranteed to start by Feb 2027. This timeline is built into the Jan 2027 profitability projection, turning linear adoption into a mandated surge by Q1 2027. 2.\tThe 'Giant' Validation & Royalty Layer: The \u00a330m model typically assumes standard 60% margins on physical hardware. It completely overlooks the Kamaptive licensing flow. When giants like Intuitive Surgical (ION) and CMR Surgical sign up for our energy solution, they validate it as Best-in-Class. These deals provide virtually 100% margin royalty income, which drops straight to the bottom line, shortening the path to PBT breakeven. Furthermore, with 400+ patents protecting the core IP, it's highly likely more 'Giants' will follow to avoid being left behind. 3.\tThe 17-Year Salary Metric: Chairman Kevin Crofton is paid ~\u00a365k/year, yet has put \u00a31.1m of his own post-tax cash into this. He has effectively invested 17 years of his salary back into the company. A man who delivered a $2.3bn exit at SPTS isn't betting on a 2029 crawl; he is positioned for the 2026/27 inflection point. You are absolutely right: Guidance for 2026 on results day will be key. We need management to shift their narrative from qualitative statements ('encouraging momentum') to quantitative metrics ('procedures per site') to show that this J-curve is real. We are all waiting for that clarity. The 2029 projection is a 'linear' view of a company hitting a 'regulatory and royalty' turbocharger. At 14p, the market is pricing in the history but ignoring the imminent mandate and the high-margin royalty ramping.

I hold 1,315,000 CREO shares. 3. The Math: The Path to Profitability (The J-Curve) The \"Bear Case\" relies on historical cash burn, but the numbers show we have hit the inflection point. This is driven by Operational Leverage: \u2022\tRevenue Velocity: FY25 H2 revenue surged 58% to \u00a33.8m. \u2022\tCost Discipline: Underlying OpEx was \"right-sized\" with a 20% reduction to \u00a318.4m. \u2022\tThe Logic: The company does not need to cut further; it simply needs to grow into its fixed cost base. As revenue scales toward a \u00a325m\u2013\u00a330m run-rate* (fueled by the NICE mandate and robotic royalties), the stable cost base allows Gross Profits to bridge the gap. Mathematically, the \"crossover point\" to self-sustaining cash flow is visible by late 2026/Jan 2027. \u2022\t*Note: Revenue run-rate figures are forward-looking projections based on the current 58% H2 growth trajectory and 60% target margins. 4. The \u00a31bn+ Buyout Potential Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p, with a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) suggested by Edison Group analysts once profitability is proven. \u2022\tM&A Logic: High-growth, high-IP MedTech carries a 10x revenue multiple. As Creo approaches a \u00a3100m run-rate, a \u00a31bn+ valuation is entirely consistent with sector precedents (e.g., Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $13.1bn Shockwave acquisition). Summary: I believe the stock is deeply undervalued and waiting for the market to price in the \"J-curve.\" For those underwater, the disconnect between the ~14.5p price and the 24p insider floor represents a significant opportunity.",

TL;DR Summary: \u2022\tInsane Entry Price: Buying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s anchor investment (24p). \u2022\tThe NICE Catalyst: NICE hand-picked Speedboat to optimize NHS resources; legal mandate for funding expected Nov 19, 2026. \u2022\tTechnical Moat: Only tech to beat the \"heat-sink\" effect in lung/liver; 400+ patent moat. \u2022\tThe Math: 58% H2 revenue growth hitting a stabilized cost base makes a Jan 2027 breakeven a mathematical probability. Full Analysis: The current share price of ~14.5p is fundamentally broken and presents an absurd disconnect from operational reality. For private investors with a 12-24 month view, this is a classic \"inflection point\" setup. 1. The Technology Moat: Why it's \"Best-in-Class\" Creo isn't competing on price; they're competing on physics. Their Kamaptive platform is the only tech that miniaturizes microwave and RF energy into a single, tiny device. \u2022\tThe \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Competitors use RF energy, which fails in highly vascularized tissue (lung/liver) because blood flow cools the area (the \"heat-sink effect\"). Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy avoids this, making it the superior clinical tool. \u2022\tThe NICE Selection: NICE specifically selected Speedboat Inject because they identified it as a key technology to ensure the \"best use of NHS resources.\" \u2022\tProven Savings: Real-world data showed the Speedboat procedure reduced hospital stays from 8.4 days to 1.1 days, saving the NHS nearly \u00a35,000 per procedure. 2. The Insider Signal: A Valuation Floor Chairman Kevin Crofton, who delivered a $2.3bn exit at his last company, put over \u00a31 million of his own cash into CREO in 2024/2025. \u2022\tHis initial anchor entry was 24p (\u00a3700k invested). \u2022\tBuying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s primary entry price. If the man tasked with delivering the exit is buying at these levels, the current ~\u00a358m market cap is an anomaly. Continued......",

If personal greed is your incentive, you are probably WRONG for the business anyway, and wrong for society generally.",

The incredible thing is you make the decision and a month letter you are wondering why you ever had the 10 to 20% in the first place. Creo cannot raise more money, so every pound they have now should be treated like gold dust, R & D pruned to the bone, the focus sales, sales, sales. No hiring, no pay increases, haircuts for the board, all obvious and urgent stuff. It is extremely frustrating. Without urgent measures the company will not survive in its present form.

This should mean strong growth, further margin improvement, and ultimately to achieve break-even (EBITDA) in a few years. A broader range of devices (several commercial launches), potential future licensing opportunities for robotics (Kamaptive tech), and optionality with Micro-Tech, should underpin this path to break-even and beyond, while being well funded through to 2027.",

CMD takeaways: Market drivers intact: Large TAM of which it is focusing on a smaller portion ($1.5bn SAM). Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics. New product launches: Currently 8 products in multi-therapeutic areas, and will have a full suit of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027 (launching 4 new GI products in next 2 years). A dedicated CPT code in US for ESD from Jan 2027 should standardize national reimbursement and is key to unlocking US growth. With regards to Intuitive, MicroBlate feedback and data (not peer reviewed) is positive thus far, but needs to build more evidence, with studies ongoing, and this is a 2027 story. No new financial info: Reiterated guidance for 40-60% growth in FY25. Growth in next 12 months almost all from existing products (Speedboat, SpydrBlade and a little bit from MicroBlate). New products to contribute after that. Along with a right sized cost base, break-even EBITDA still expected in 2028 and believe sufficiently funded to get there.

The losses have only narrowed slightly, sales numbers have consistently come in like tales of the unexpected. 2028 is far far away, a kind of wishful fantasy where words mean what we want them to mean.

I\u2019ve had keyhole surgery on my oesophagus twice and while it\u2019s far better than being opened up with a large incision, the surgeon still has to make 5 puncture wounds to get all the kit in, including a gas tube to bloat you up so the surgeon can see what he\u2019s doing. Furthermore I needed separate visits for an endoscopy. Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages. Being opened up from the outside also introduces more risk of picking up an infection. What Creo enables, especially in treatment of lung and pancreatic cancer, feels like Dr Bones Star Trek stuff.",

I estimate that some \u00a3120mn of equity has been raised since 2019 at prices varying from 180p down to 20p. And yet the current MC of the company is \u00a370mn, far less than the total capital invested to build the technology and associated infrastructure. It means the market is assigning a negative value to the company's future potential, or at the very least, giving new investors the entire R&D, the FDA clearances and the global robotic partnerships, for free. Why, and what does this mean? One way of looking at it is that early investors paying 180p were paying up for the invention risk. New investors today are paying for \"Execution risk\". What would a large, well-funded medtech company, like Medtronic, say, spend to recreate Creo's CROMA platform, Speedboat and Kamaptive IP from scratch today? Far more than \u00a370mn, I expect, and maybe 5-7 years of R&D. So Creo  is selling well below its Replacement value. On the negative side, there must be a negative \"AIM\" discount. And a funding fear, that the \u00a310mn junior funding commitment cannot be refinanced or repaid at maturity in November. So there is a considerable \"show me\" element to the current valuation, as a pre-revenue medtech business, at least at scale even if starting up and growing rapidly. I am inclined to the positive side of this fascinating market opportunity. The tech is proven, the sales are ramping up, and the November NICE decision will be  (fingers crossed) the \"Value Unlock\" that corrects this somewhat irrational market pricing.",

The most successful ramps I have seen are with RC365/Woodbois/Mast Energy illiquid minnows (look at their charts) and these have been promoted through false news/financial websites. Not a big user of youtube,  I do like investor meets though if you have seen them. As for NICE I have looked through the latest Cavendish note and there is no mention of it. The management have always said they haven't allowed for any kamaptive (3rd party) sales and I *think* the same applies to NICE. Certainly no sales this year. Of course NICE is a help, they can sell to the NHS without it. For me  - that they hit 2025 sales targets and are confident of meeting this years shows that they have finally got traction and hopefully their forecasts aren't the fantasy that they have previously been. Getting a partnership and takeoff in the US/China could dwarf any UK sales. For me this has been a poor investment, but I still have faith it can be a success. Its not been a smooth road but I think the TU was pivotal. Time will tell, but good luck with whatever you decide.",

I'm still learning to distinguish between genuine posters with original thoughts, however non-consensual, and AI-driven ones, that come across as all -knowing, reasoned commentaries.  They pop up all over the place these days. For example, as a Gold and Silver bug, using YouTube increasingly, I and many other experienced investors were taken in by a certain \"Asian_Guy\" , who seemed very knowledgeable and posted stuff that was about 80% right, but then added spurious sensationalist stuff that fitted his/her agenda but was subsequently shown to be simply made up. I was initially taken in by Equitable, as a reasonable pov. And this guy may have 1.5mn shares in Creo. I have no idea if this is true. But as I delve more deeply into Creo, I am naturally inclined to try and see all sides of the investment case, and that means wondering  if the NICE timeline might slip from November. And also wondering if Creo has built in a margin of safety for Trusts not taking up the  ESD knife product within a short time frame due to individual Trust's bureaucracy, budgets or Specialists' resistance for whatever reason. If asking these questions in all sincerity in a public forum is deemed to be a negativity, then that reflects more on the responder than the questioner, in my opinion. Not my problem. I just look for knowledgeable posters willing to spend a few minutes of their time to broaden my knowledge base about Creo, and in so doing, help to spread the word to a wider audience, as I admit I have not come across Creo up until now. My sole biotech investment is Avacta. Sorry for the long reply. I am interested and willing to read up on the tech, and Creo's place in this rapidly expanding market segment. And then there is the issue of management, which I have read about from certain posters, given the tortuous road travelled over the past few years in the stockmarket.  For another day, perhaps....",

Secondly, its not their robotic sytem that is up for appraisal. Thirdly the core product sales forecast for this year is c11m, thats about 70%. This excludes NICE approval as even if it does happen on time it won't make any difference to this years sales. Whilst a positive outcome will undoubtedly help its not the be all and end all.

The Partial Collateral Valve: Creo retains a 49% stake in its European business\u2014a division valued at over \u00a360m (\u20ac72m). As a safety valve, the company has the option to partially secure debt against a percentage of this asset. This 'Surgical Financing' provides a non-dilutive bridge to breakeven while the asset continues to grow in value and generate profit shares. 2. The 'Drain' is Narrowing Fast: The January 2026 trading update confirmed the strategy is working. Management has slashed underlying operating losses by over 40% to \u00a313.3m, with revenue up 50%. With \u00a312.4m cash already in the bank and operating costs falling by 20%, the march to cash-flow breakeven is now a visible commercial reality. 3. Systemic Mandate (Streeting Reforms): Health Secretary Wes Streeting\u2019s new reforms\u2014including NHS League Tables and tying Trust funding to productivity\u2014are designed specifically to force the adoption of cost-saving tech like Speedboat\u2122 Inject. The delay isn't a lack of data; it\u2019s a systemic lag that the government is now mandating to be cleared. 4. Market Momentum: The share price has already climbed from 14p to 17.75p in just the last week (a 24.5% rise). The market is starting to see that 14p was a survival-mode valuation, but the reality of 2026 is a company with a protected balance sheet and massive strategic value. Management has the non-dilutive levers to reach the finish line. Disclaimer:  These are personal thoughts & opinions based on publicly available info. Not financial advice.

I see a positive decision as a share spike opportunity for CREO to push through a much needed further equity raise, at lesser dilution than would be required now, say.",

I just dont think you will get a lender to lend a material amount against it, particularly as Creo dont decide the cashflow (the DVD). i wouldnt want them to borrow on that basis either as if they fell out with Med Tech they are in trouble as they could cut the DVD off quite easily. As a loan, the only way I would take any value from it is if Med_Tech itself lent the money and did so on a limited recourse basis, limited to the cashflow from the DVD, so no general recourse. The market would not value a straight third party loan in the way you think, it would be a negative. The only other sensible way to monetise it is via a further partial sale if that becomes necessary. My cashflow projections suggest it will be very tight as I am pretty sure dealing with NHS type entities will be working capital intensive. If they came to some sort of licencing agreement with Intuitive which had an upfront cash payment, that would also work. Management have said they have the resources to get to cashflow breakeven, given their history, I think they have not made that statement lightly and so hopefully a further sale of the 49% is not needed. However, I would encourage management to explain in detail their calculations on this critical aspect. In fact, I would want Crofton to lead the discussion on this, not the CFO.",

The \"Hybrid\" Victory: Ion + da Vinci Creo is uniquely positioned as the first and only partner to provide a dual-energy (RF/Microwave) platform for both of Intuitive\u2019s flagship robots: Internal Ablation (Ion) via MicroBlate Flex and External Resection (da Vinci) via SpydrBlade Flex. Integrated into the da Vinci platform (10,000+ units globally), Creo is becoming a universal surgical energy standard. 6. Strategic Certainty and the Inevitable Exit At a share price of ~14p and a market cap of roughly \u00a350m, the valuation disconnect is profound. Considering Creo received ~\u00a325m in cash for its European stake, the market effectively values the global IP and robotic partnerships at zero. As robotic and non-invasive surgery becomes the global default, a total buyout by a MedTech giant becomes a strategic certainty. Entities with the cash and the need include: \u2022\tIntuitive Surgical: Seeking a \"closed-loop\" system to capture high-margin consumable revenue. \u2022\tJohnson & Johnson (J&J MedTech): Needing an energy suite for their Ottava\u2122 platform. \u2022\tMedtronic: Looking to replace aging ablation tech with Creo\u2019s precision range. \u2022\tOlympus Corporation: Transitioning from a \"camera company\" into a \"robotic treatment company.\" The technology is on a superb global flight path for both patients and shareholders. For those who see past the noise, Creo represents a foundational opportunity at the start of a global surgical revolution.

          "content": "Part 1 of 2 The Global Robotic Infrastructure: Why the \u00a31.25bn Lung Pillar is Just the Foundation of Creo\u2019s Value Realisation 1. The Macro Catalyst: Wes Streeting, Prof. Shah, and the NICE Pipeline On January 20, 2026, Health Secretary Wes Streeting visited Royal Brompton Hospital, hosted by Professor Pallav Shah and NHS England CEO Amanda Pritchard. Streeting hailed the robotic \"one-stop-shop\" lung procedure as \"the future of the NHS.\" This momentum is backed by a critical regulatory driver: Speedboat\u2122 Inject is under formal NICE assessment, with guidance expected by November 2026. By February 2026, NHS Trusts are preparing business cases to trigger the MedTech Funding Mandate; once NICE approves a cost-saving device, the NHS is legally obliged to fund and adopt it, clearing the path for a rapid revenue surge across the UK\u2019s 350+ hospitals. 2. From Keyhole to Non-Invasive (The Endoluminal Revolution) While the market focus is on robotic \"keyhole\" surgery, Creo\u2019s technology is enabling a shift toward totally non-invasive, incisionless treatment. By using the body\u2019s natural pathways\u2014the airways for lungs and the GI tract for bowel/stomach cancers\u2014Creo allows clinicians to biopsy and ablate tumors without a single external cut. This endoluminal approach reduces recovery times from weeks to hours and is the primary reason clinicians like Professor Pallav Shah describe this as a generational breakthrough. 3. Regulatory Dominance vs. Clinical Adoption (The Data Moat) The core suite\u2014Speedboat, MicroBlate, SlypSeal, and SpydrBlade\u2014already holds CE Mark and FDA Clearance. Ongoing trials are building the Economic Evidence Base, proving Creo\u2019s tech is safer and cheaper than traditional surgery. Real-world NHS data showing that Speedboat\u2122 Inject saves approximately \u00a35,000 per procedure (equating to \u00a3687k per Trust) is foundational to the NICE review. This \"Data Moat\" creates a massive barrier to entry that competitors would require years of clinical data to replicate. 4. The \"Ion\" Maths: A \u00a31.25bn Revenue Pillar (MicroBlate Flex Alone) Lung cancer accounts for 2.2 million new cases annually. The potential for MicroBlate Flex (at ~\u00a35,700 per disposable) represents a massive untapped upside: \u2022\tApproved Base Case (US, EU, UK, Ex-China APAC): ~1.14m new cases p.a. A 10% adoption rate represents a \u00a3650 million annual recurring revenue path. \u2022\tChina Multiplier: Adding China\u2019s ~1.06m cases via the Micro-Tech partnership jumps the potential to \u00a31.25 billion annually.

It felt like money was being spent as if it weren't theirs. While management salaries and benefits have increased over the years, shareholder returns have gone the other way, and those losses are a bitter pill to swallow. Gulliford and Rees now need to deliver for the shareholders. I hope they are reflecting on those past decisions because the grace period for 'potential' is over\u2014it is now about execution. However, I believe the arrival of Kevin Crofton marked the end of that era. We are finally seeing results: operating costs were slashed by 20% to \u00a318.4 million in the FY2025 results. Two things now signal a fundamental change in tide: Alignment: The decision to revise management\u2019s option strike prices from 13.125p up to 24p was right. It ensures they don\u2019t profit from the 'bottom'\u2014they only win if they drive the price back up for us. The Safety Valve: A debt drawdown facility (secured against the 49% stake or other means) is our insurance policy. It doesn't have to be used, but it tells the market we are funded without being forced into an immediate further stake sale or a dilutive equity raise.

Securing a debt facility against the 49% stake, or by other means, acts as a critical safety valve. It sends a clear message to the market that the risk of further dilution is effectively off the table and that Creo is fully funded to act without being forced into an equity raise. Given the growth trajectory and the massive inherent value of the Kamaptive technology, lenders are looking at the 'Tech value' and buyout potential, which provides a much more significant cushion than a simple cash-flow analysis of the European arm. Ultimately, as the core business scales and we hit our stride globally, that 49% stake will eventually look like 'chicken feed' compared to the value of the main enterprise. We are holding it now for leverage and strategic optionality, ensuring that any future moves are made from a position of absolute strength.",

Predator Urgency & the \u00a31bn+ Valuation: The Path to Re-rating The current share price of ~14p fundamentally ignores the true strategic value of Creo's assets. A predator's (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, CMR Surgical) interest is in long-term, multi-billion-dollar market access and IP, not today's P&L statement. The path to a \u00a31bn+ valuation uses M&A math, which is different from standard analyst forecasts: \u2022\tAnalyst Price Targets (The Floor): Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p. Edison Group analysts suggested a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) once profitability is proven. This is the market's current conservative \"floor\". \u2022\tThe M&A Strategic Premium (The Ceiling): The \u00a31bn+ valuation is achieved when a predator applies a much higher premium for strategic control. A predator benefits significantly by acquiring now to gain a market and IP monopoly: o\tIntuitive Surgical (The Integration Gap): Intuitive dominates robotic surgery but has historically relied on third-party energy tools. Acquiring Creo would allow them to own the entire \"Search & Destroy\" procedure (diagnosis + ablation) \"in a single sitting,\" a major goal for robotic surgery, and integrate Creo's technology like the MicroBlate Flex into its ION and flagship da Vinci platforms. o\tMedtronic (The Vascular \"Heat-Sink\" Gap): Medtronic is a leader in advanced energy with its LigaSure (RF) products. Standard RF ablation is limited by the \"heat-sink\" effect, where blood flow cools tissue and prevents tumor destruction. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy is largely unaffected by blood flow, providing a \"gold standard\" tool for abating tumors in highly vascularized organs like the liver and pancreas where Medtronic's current tools often fall short. This is achieved using the world\u2019s only 19-gauge less than 1mm) microwave ablation needle, MicroBlate Fine, the only device thin enough to destroy pancreatic and liver tumors internally via standard Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS), avoiding invasive surgery. o\tBoston Scientific (High-Growth Adjacency): Boston Scientific has an established position in interventional oncology and is actively pursuing acquisitions to expand into new high-growth segments and compete with Medtronic. Creo's unique energy platform and product pipeline perfectly align with BSX's strategy of M&A for \"high-growth adjacency\" markets where they have a limited presence today. o\tCMR Surgical (Robotic Energy Gap): CMR is a major global player in robotic surgery with its Versius system. Their primary focus is on the robotic platform itself rather than advanced energy tools. They have a licensing agreement with Creo; an acquisition would allow them to own \"best-in-class\" energy and prevent competitors from doing the same.

          "content": "Part 11 of 11 Summary: The analysis in this post perfectly lays out the 'Ghost of Creo Past.' But my view is that we are at the precipice of 'Creo Future,' where the RNS transparency improves, some of the IP value is unlocked by the NICE mandate (which is a 'when' not an 'if'), and we hit the J-curve. I hold a very high conviction that the current price fundamentally undervalues the company's prospects. The company is now firmly moving from an R&D entity to a commercial one. Time will tell if management finally delivers, but the data points for a turnaround are stronger than ever. The current share price of ~14p is a reflection of the analyst consensus, combined with high market perception of risk, a liquidity discount, and widespread assumption of future dilution. This entirely ignores the intrinsic value of the \u00a326.9m stake and its cash-generative benefits from the Creo Medical Europe (CME) joint venture, which solidify our 'Fortress Balance Sheet'. My 'J-curve' analysis is ahead of this curve; I believe our (self-funding debt/dividend model from CME) will accelerate profitability by December 2027, closing that valuation gap rapidly and commanding a premium for completely removing the doubt of dilution and reflecting the high probability of a predator buyout. The additional, pure-profit royalty payments (Intuitive/CMR), the MicroBlate Flex US commercial opportunity including da Vinci integration, the new MicroBlate Fine catalyst, and the bipolar range (Speedboat, SpydrBlade, etc.) further support this timeline to December 2027, and \u201cwith a little bit of wind in our sails we could be quiet ahead of that\u201d. Ultimately, let's not forget that beyond the balance sheet, Creo\u2019s technology is changing and saving people's lives every day. That is the most enduring value of all.

External DCF Models Reinforce the Undervaluation The argument for undervaluation extends beyond internal analysis: even external, conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) models consistently produce a share price far exceeding the current ~14p. Some private valuations on boards using robust models have even placed fair value around 43p based on conservative \u00a326m revenue estimates for FY28. \u2022\tConservative Estimates: Independent models using a high WACC (15%) and a subjective \"UK discount\" still arrive at a share price valuation between 47p and 55p. \u2022\tThe Disconnect: This substantial gap highlights the market's current fixation on \"risk\" and \"past performance.\" These models reinforce the argument that the fundamental, de-risked value of the company is already three to four times the current share price. \u2022\tMissing the \"J-Curve\" Catalysts: Standard DCF models struggle to accurately price in the rapid adoption that catalysts like the US CPT code will cause. The CPT code alone can nearly quadruple a physician's revenue for Speedboat procedures, creating a \"pull\" from the US market that is difficult to model today but impossible to ignore as a value driver. 11.

Royalty Streams (Pure Profit) & MicroBlate Flex \u2018The Wind in Our Sails\u2019 It is critical to remember that both commercial sales and licensing agreements represent a significant amount of \"wind in our sails\" and high-margin potential. \u2022\tMicroBlate Flex (Commercial Sales): The lung device is purchased commercially for an estimated \u00a35,700 per unit. Revenue from this has a margin well over 60%. Importantly, it is already being sold commercially on an individual basis at the Royal Brompton Hospital. A total of six sites are expected to run in the UK and Europe under the Pioneer Programme to gather clinical evidence ahead of a full commercial launch. A further 1 site is expected to go commercial sales in H1-26. The device is also approved for use in the USA, where the market presents a substantial opportunity for growth. The Intuitive ION partnership also has the potential for expanded scope into the high-growth APAC market. Intuitive Surgical recently announced its FY25 results, stating that ION procedures grew c51% in the year. This procedure growth highlights the immense potential of the US lung tumor opportunity, which is currently not factored into most P&L analyst reports. We should start to see the pull from Intuitive via their sales channels in 2026/2027. \u2022\tRoyalty Streams (Pure Profit): Royalty and licensing agreements have been been signed with both Intuitive Surgical and CMR Surgical. While specific commercial terms remain undisclosed in RNS statements, these are virtually 100% margin incomes that add immense pressure on potential predators to act now, as they would want to limit the licensing of Creo's \"best in class\" advanced energy to their competitors.

The NHS / NICE Mandate: The \"Streeting Factor\" & High Probability of Rapid Adoption This isn't just about clinical guidelines; it's about a legal and political mandate for funding that creates a perfect storm for rapid adoption. For independent verification, you can review the official NICE project page for the Creo Speedboat (GID-MT602) here: www.nice.org.uk. \u2022\tThe NICE Catalyst: NICE hand-picked Speedboat to optimize NHS resources; a legal mandate for funding is expected around November 19, 2026. \u2022\tProven Savings: Real-world data showed the Speedboat procedure reduced hospital stays from 8.4 days to 1.1 days, saving the NHS nearly \u00a35,000 per procedure. \u2022\tThe \"Streeting Factor\" (Why Enforcement is Guaranteed): Wes Streeting has explicitly stated the NHS must 'reform or die,' tying future funding to productivity gains. Under this 'Value for Money' framework, a Trust refusing to adopt a NICE-mandated, cost-saving technology like Speedboat isn't just ignoring a guideline\u2014they are actively defying the government\u2019s core strategy. This creates: o\tContractual & Legal Breach: The NHS Standard Contract mandates compliance with the MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM). Refusal is a breach of contract with financial penalties. o\tNo Local Veto: The MTFM policy is clear: local 'affordability' is not an excuse because the tech is proven to be cost-saving. o\tThe 90-Day Clock: The Health and Social Care Act creates a statutory obligation for funding to be available within 90 days of a NICE publication. By February 2027, the adoption of Creo's technology isn't just expected\u2014it is contractually and legally mandated, acting as a massive 'adoption accelerator.'

The disconnect between Kevin Crofton\u2019s \u00a31.1m personal investment and the current ~14p price provides a clear valuation floor. Since joining in July 2024, he has purchased over \u00a31 million in shares using his own funds, signaling a commitment far beyond his \u00a364k annual fee. His initial anchor entry was 24p (\u00a3700k invested), meaning the current price is a 40% discount to his main entry point. A man who delivered a $2.3bn exit at SPTS did not invest his own capital to wait for a distant FY28/FY29 timeline. He is signaling the 2026/2027 rapid inflection point is imminent. This signal reinforces my personal high conviction in this company. The AMA CPT reimbursement code is a key part of this inflection point. Physicians who may earn $300 for a standard colonoscopy could earn over $1,000 for the procedures Speedboat enables. This massive financial incentive for the US private market will encourage rapid training and adoption as the code comes into effect in January 2027. Furthermore, the NICE Catalyst is another powerful accelerator. A legal mandate for funding is expected around November 19, 2026. This was based on real-world data showing significant reductions in hospital stays and costs per procedure. Wes Streeting's political pressure makes this a powerful adoption accelerator.

Predator Urgency & the \u00a31bn+ Valuation: The Path to Re-rating The current share price of ~14p fundamentally ignores the true strategic value of Creo's assets. A predator's (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive Surgical, CMR Surgical) interest is in long-term, multi-billion-dollar market access and IP, not today's P&L statement. The path to a \u00a31bn+ valuation uses M&A math, which is different from standard analyst forecasts: \u2022\tAnalyst Price Targets (The Floor): Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p. Edison Group analysts suggested a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) once profitability is proven. This is the market's current conservative \"floor\". \u2022\tThe M&A Strategic Premium (The Ceiling): The \u00a31bn+ valuation is achieved when a predator applies a much higher premium for strategic control. A predator benefits significantly by acquiring now to gain a market and IP monopoly: o\tIntuitive Surgical (The Integration Gap): Intuitive dominates robotic surgery but has historically relied on third-party energy tools. Acquiring Creo would allow them to own the entire \"Search & Destroy\" procedure (diagnosis + ablation) \"in a single sitting,\" a major goal for robotic surgery, and integrate Creo's technology like the MicroBlate Flex into its ION and flagship da Vinci platforms. o\tMedtronic (The Vascular \"Heat-Sink\" Gap): Medtronic is a leader in advanced energy with its LigaSure (RF) products. Standard RF ablation is limited by the \"heat-sink\" effect, where blood flow cools tissue and prevents tumor destruction. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy is largely unaffected by blood flow, providing a \"gold standard\" tool for abating tumors in highly vascularized organs like the liver and pancreas where Medtronic's current tools often fall short.

Integration allows for digital tomosynthesis, which corrects for \"CT-to-Body Divergence\" (when the tumor moves as the patient breathes). This ensures the probe stays on target. Robotic Stability: Robotic \"lock-on\" technology achieves a targeting accuracy of 97%, ensuring energy is delivered exactly to the malignancy while sparing healthy surrounding tissue. \u2022\tThe Commercial Maths: A 285% Procedure Revenue Lift (\u00a3): At a market price of \u00a35,700 per probe, the MicroBlate Flex transforms the economics of the robotic suite. A standard diagnostic biopsy generates ~\u00a32,000 in disposables. Adding the \u00a35,700 MicroBlate probe brings the total disposable revenue to \u00a37,700 per patient\u2014a 285% increase in revenue per robotic session. TAM Expansion (The Inoperable Market): For the 20% of lung cancer patients too frail for the \"gold standard\" surgery, this combination is the only curative-intent option, massively expanding the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Growth Potential: At a moderate adoption rate of 50,000 procedures annually, probe sales alone generate \u00a3285,000,000 in high-margin recurring revenue. \u2022\tScaling to the Flagship: The \"da Vinci\" Factor: The most significant upside is the potential migration of MicroBlate Flex to the flagship da Vinci platform, which has an installed base of over 11,100 systems globally. This dramatically expands access to the global lung cancer market (an estimated 2.5m new cases annually). The \u00a31 Billion Opportunity: If utilized in just 10% of these annual lung cancer cases, the recurring revenue potential from the probe alone exceeds \u00a31.4 Billion annually. \u2022\tThe Buyout Logic: A Strategic Necessity for Intuitive: As the 2026 commercial rollout accelerates, a buyout of Creo Medical by Intuitive Surgical is seen as a strategic imperative. Monopoly Defense: There is currently no other validated microwave probe that fits the Ion\u2019s ultra-thin architecture. Intuitive must own the technology to prevent rivals from acquiring it. Margin Capture: Intuitive currently \"leaves money on the table\" by sharing the \u00a35,700 probe revenue. By acquiring Creo and the Kamaptive energy platform, Intuitive captures 100% of the profit and fully integrates \"Search & Destroy\" into its global surgical ecosystem.

These numbers are currently not baked into Creo\u2019s expectations and guidance to the market. Furthermore, Micro-Tech together with other companies will ultimately be our manufacturing partner, moving significant product volume away from exclusive in-house manufacturing over the next few years. Partnering with Micro-Tech\u2014the market leader in China with a 30% share\u2014gives Creo 'best-in-class' access to NMPA (China's FDA) registrations. As Micro-Tech aggressively grows the business by bringing in new products at factory prices, the stake transforms into a high-yield dividend engine. We already saw the start of this in the FY25 Interims, which recognized a \u00a30.4m profit share from the associate; significantly, this only covered a partial 4.5-month period following the deal completion in February. As this annualizes and scales, we are sitting on a significant share of future cashflows that the market is overlooking. \u2022\tThe Debt 'Safety Valve' (A Self-Funding Model): We need to secure a managed drawdown facility as a pure safety net, where interest is only paid on funds actually deployed. This facility is expected to be used as a last resort, satisfying market and investor doubts to completely price out the risk of dilution. Crucially, the cost of setting up this 'belt and braces' facility could/should be covered by the cashflows and dividends from the 49% stake in Creo Medical Europe. This creates a Win-Win-Win-Win: 1. We keep the strategic 49% asset and ride its growing value; 2. We eliminate the threat of dilution; 3. We trigger a massive Share Price re-rating by proving the 'funding gap' is permanently closed; 4. We protect and enhance the Predator Premium. 4. The \"Search & Destroy\" Revolution: MicroBlate Flex + Intuitive Robotics \u2022\tClinical Proof: Challenging the Surgical Gold Standard: While traditional surgery remains the established gold standard for lung cancer, MicroBlate Flex is the leading \"Emerging Challenger\" backed by microscopic evidence. Analysis from \"ablate and and resect\" studies at Amsterdam UMC and Royal Brompton Hospital has confirmed 100% complete cell death in treated tumors. This provides the \"ground truth\" that microwave energy matches the tumor-killing efficacy of a scalpel. The \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Unlike older technologies, MicroBlate\u2019s microwave energy is not \"cooled down\" by nearby blood vessels. This ensures a predictable and uniform kill zone in the highly vascular environment of the lung. Superior Safety: Early data continues to show 0% procedure-related mortality for MicroBlate Flex, compared to the 2.1% mortality rate historically associated with traditional surgical resection.

Based on general market perception and discussions across various message boards, the SP is anchored at ~14p due to perceived 'red flags' in the interim balance sheet and the legacy of past results. However, I believe this sentiment is anchored in the past, and that these same points are actually the primary indicators of the upcoming re-rating:\" 1. The \u00a3160M Loss & the 'Hidden' DTA Regarding the Deferred Tax Asset (DTA). The accountants\u2019 'wait-and-see' approach is a lagging indicator. Creo has over \u00a3160M in accumulated losses; when you apply the UK's 25% corporation tax rate to these losses, it results in a potential \u00a340M tax saving. Once we hit the NICE Mandate inflection point and move toward PBT profitability, that \u00a340m asset could be recognized. That would be a massive, non-cash boost to the NAV (Net Asset Value) currently priced at zero. 2. Conservative Accounting vs. IP Reality The ~\u00a30.5m Intangible Asset figure is a massive 'bull' point. Because management expensed the R&D, the balance sheet looks 'empty.' In reality, we have 400+ patents that would cost a 'Big Dog' hundreds of millions to replicate. The current pipeline of devices is just the beginning; a next generation CROMA system or another market-disrupting device is expected to come from this robust R&D pipeline. In addition to other companies the partnership with Micro-Tech also allows us to use them as an outsourced design and development house for a broader range of more commoditized high volume devices such as the bipolar snare and bipolar knife. We are essentially buying world-class IP for pennies because of the accounting treatment. We are competing on physics, not price. The Kamaptive platform is the only tech that miniaturizes microwave and RF energy into a single, tiny device. This creates a significant \"Technical Moat\": \u2022\tThe \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Competitors use RF energy, which often fails in highly vascularized tissue (lung/liver) because blood flow cools the area. Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy avoids this, making it the superior clinical tool. 3. The 'Fortress Balance Sheet' & Creo Medical Europe (CME) MicroTech JV Growth \u2022\tMicro-Tech as a Growth Engine: We are sitting on an asset that is worth \u00a326.9m (the book value of the remaining 49% stake in Creo Medical Europe), which is a massive amount for an AIM company of this market cap. We should move away from seeing the 49% stake as just a 'Safety Valve.' Its value has likely increased considerably due to the powerful strategic alignment. Micro-Tech is arguably the best possible partner to access the huge and complicated Chinese market. Disclaimer:  These are personal thoughts & opinions based on publicly available info.

It wont be perfect but even trying to do it makes you think about the critical issues and how they are doing against those value drivers.

I just hope for gradual progression and that my investment will eventually come good. At the beginning of this year it was my 2nd worst ever investment (in value terms, I've had a few -100%) and now its up to the dizzy heights of 3rd worst.  Its a company that I have become too emotionally attached to, and thats never a good thing. But I still believe that these results are the end of the very long beginning and its moving from an R&D to a commercial entity.",

Been to an AGM (I live close to chepstow, met Kevin Crofton seemed decent (as did Craig) but I'm not going to judge on that. I've worked in a similar industry and have a decent understanding of the products. My thoughts are thus 1) They hit their targets for the first time in the recent TU. Great, but one swallow doesn't make a summer etc. 2) They are happy with the forecasts for this year - after only 3 weeks. Great to have confidence. FY forecasts is something like 11-12m, the two brokers (Edison/Cavendish) have differing forecasts. Thats roughly double last years sales. 3) If they hit that and keep costs under control then the company is much closer to being viable. I'd be interested to know \"like for like\" headcount now vs 2025. The costs didn't drop as much as I expected. Prove we can get close then other sources of funding may become available. 4) The timescale for NICE take up will be slower than mentioned. The way that the Croma platform works is different to standard procedures and requires some training. Its needs a few days training and some hand holding and can't be adopted overnight. The last thing you'd want to hear before going under is the surgeon asking \"what does this button do\" :-) 5) US adoption will be key. Thats not going to happen until 2027 due to the reimbursement happening then. 6) I'm hoping for some more clinical results this year and next, hopefully getting Intuitive more involved and promoting it on their Ion Endoluminal system. That would be a huge installed base to bring on board. As I've said here and elsewhere I think these results may be an inflection point. I hope so, I have a large position thats somewhat underwater. I've not added to my position (clearly I should have traded, but thats not my style). Hopefully they will keep the market up to date more regularly to show they are on track. If they are at HY I'll probably buy more.",

Thankfully, we only bought in over the last 12 months or so as my biggest issue with any management team is raising money at 24p and subsequently watching the price go under 10p. They of course will say that is not something they control but I disagree. Great management teams understand the importance of building momentum and always delivering, over and over again, on what you guide. The price chart of Creo sends a very strong message to management (and they have been the same people) on how they have done so far. Lets not forget this is a tiny company trying to bark with the big dogs and yes while it may have hundreds of patents it is interesting to me that most of the expenditure has been expenses. If it was so enduring surely it would have been capitalised. Their capitalised IA is \u00a30.7M as at June, insignificant really. From June to Dec the cash burn has been just under \u00a38m, \u00a36.3M on receipt of the available for sale. They are running out of things to sell. They do have another tax receivable of \u00a32.9M but after that, they are just left with Medtech. On this entity they dont need to tie capital in this entity, they can achieve what they need with a contractual relationship and a smaller \"good faith\" equity stake. At the end of the day at 49% they are still out voted. If there is some other reason for retaining 49% they should be explicit about it. From an IR perspective I find them very poor communicators which you only have to look at the share price for an independent view on.",

Regarding the cash flow and the Europe stake, I think our risk appetites might differ slightly: 1.\tThe Cash Position: We finished FY25 with \u00a312.4m cash. Management expects to reach self-sustaining cash flows, and with the current burn rate narrowing rapidly, the bridge to profitability is shorter than the market thinks. 2.\tThe Non-Dilutive Options: Equity funding below 24p would be incredibly difficult to justify. This is why a managed drawdown facility is such a strong option. Securing credit is a strategic 'Fortress Balance Sheet' move; it\u2019s not about intending to spend the cash, but having it available removes the 'smell of a raise' and signals external banking confidence in the 2027 numbers. 3.\tMicroTech as a Strategic Asset: We should move away from seeing the 49% MicroTech stake as just a 'backstop.' It's a high-value strategic asset that strengthens the group valuation. Having \u20ac30m of value locked in a performing associate is a luxury most AIM peers simply don't have. The Bigger Picture: Ultimately, while we debate the cash flow, we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the scarcity of this asset. We are looking at a company with 400+ patents and an energy platform that has already been validated by a global titan like Intuitive Surgical. With the NICE Mandate [GID-MT602] landing in Nov 2026, we are transitioning from 'disruptive tech' to a legally mandated standard of care in the NHS. That shift\u2014combined with 100% margin royalties starting to ramp\u2014is the perfect storm for a significant re-rating. At 14p/15p, the market is pricing in the historical 'struggle' while completely ignoring the imminent commercial explosion. The J-curve is coming; I\u2019m happy to wait for the guidance to confirm it.

          "content": "That is a very common perception, but it's important to distinguish between 'clinical guidelines' and 'funding mandates.' The MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) is backed by specific legal and contractual requirements. Here is what happens if an NHS unit refuses to comply: 1.\tContractual Breach: The NHS Standard Contract is the legally binding document between commissioners (ICBs) and providers (Trusts). General Condition 2.2 explicitly mandates compliance with MTFM guidance. Refusal to fund Speedboat would constitute a breach of contract, allowing the commissioner to withhold payments or issue a formal 'Contract Query.' 2.\tFinancial Penalties: Under the NHS System Oversight Framework, NHS England monitors 'efficiency and productivity.' Since Speedboat is proven by NICE to be cost-saving (saving ~\u00a35k per procedure), a Trust that refuses to adopt it is intentionally wasting taxpayer money. This can lead to a 'Requires Improvement' rating, which triggers direct intervention from NHS England and can impact the Trust\u2019s future capital allocations. 3.\tThe '90-Day' Legal Clock: The Health and Social Care Act creates a statutory obligation to make funding available within 90 days of a NICE publication. Patients and clinicians can legally challenge a Trust that fails to provide a mandated, cost-saving treatment. 4.\tNo Local Veto: The MTFM Policy Guidance is clear: local 'affordability' is not an excuse. Because the technology is cost-saving, the policy is designed to overcome the very barriers people are worried about. So, while some Trusts might be slow, they cannot simply say 'no' without facing serious regulatory and financial consequences. By February 2027, the 'jump' to adopting Creo's technology isn't just expected\u2014it is contractually and legally mandated.

          "content": "Senator1 Excellent analysis and fair points raised. The math on the \u00a330m PBT breakeven at 60% GP is a solid baseline, but I believe it overlooks three critical 'accelerants' that pull that date into 2027: 1.\tThe NICE Mandate J-Curve: I\u2019ve factored in a deployment lag here. The Nov 2026 Mandate [GID-MT602] requires NHS commissioners to provide funding within 90 days of publication. So while the mandate drops in November, the enforceable revenue flow is guaranteed to start by Feb 2027. This timeline is built into the Jan 2027 profitability projection, turning linear adoption into a mandated surge by Q1 2027. 2.\tThe 'Giant' Validation & Royalty Layer: The \u00a330m model typically assumes standard 60% margins on physical hardware. It completely overlooks the Kamaptive licensing flow. When giants like Intuitive Surgical (ION) and CMR Surgical sign up for our energy solution, they validate it as Best-in-Class. These deals provide virtually 100% margin royalty income, which drops straight to the bottom line, shortening the path to PBT breakeven. Furthermore, with 400+ patents protecting the core IP, it's highly likely more 'Giants' will follow to avoid being left behind. 3.\tThe 17-Year Salary Metric: Chairman Kevin Crofton is paid ~\u00a365k/year, yet has put \u00a31.1m of his own post-tax cash into this. He has effectively invested 17 years of his salary back into the company. A man who delivered a $2.3bn exit at SPTS isn't betting on a 2029 crawl; he is positioned for the 2026/27 inflection point. You are absolutely right: Guidance for 2026 on results day will be key. We need management to shift their narrative from qualitative statements ('encouraging momentum') to quantitative metrics ('procedures per site') to show that this J-curve is real. We are all waiting for that clarity. The 2029 projection is a 'linear' view of a company hitting a 'regulatory and royalty' turbocharger. At 14p, the market is pricing in the history but ignoring the imminent mandate and the high-margin royalty ramping.

I hold 1,315,000 CREO shares. 3. The Math: The Path to Profitability (The J-Curve) The \"Bear Case\" relies on historical cash burn, but the numbers show we have hit the inflection point. This is driven by Operational Leverage: \u2022\tRevenue Velocity: FY25 H2 revenue surged 58% to \u00a33.8m. \u2022\tCost Discipline: Underlying OpEx was \"right-sized\" with a 20% reduction to \u00a318.4m. \u2022\tThe Logic: The company does not need to cut further; it simply needs to grow into its fixed cost base. As revenue scales toward a \u00a325m\u2013\u00a330m run-rate* (fueled by the NICE mandate and robotic royalties), the stable cost base allows Gross Profits to bridge the gap. Mathematically, the \"crossover point\" to self-sustaining cash flow is visible by late 2026/Jan 2027. \u2022\t*Note: Revenue run-rate figures are forward-looking projections based on the current 58% H2 growth trajectory and 60% target margins. 4. The \u00a31bn+ Buyout Potential Analyst price targets sit between 40p and 70p, with a peak valuation of 102p per share (\u00a3419m market cap) suggested by Edison Group analysts once profitability is proven. \u2022\tM&A Logic: High-growth, high-IP MedTech carries a 10x revenue multiple. As Creo approaches a \u00a3100m run-rate, a \u00a31bn+ valuation is entirely consistent with sector precedents (e.g., Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $13.1bn Shockwave acquisition). Summary: I believe the stock is deeply undervalued and waiting for the market to price in the \"J-curve.\" For those underwater, the disconnect between the ~14.5p price and the 24p insider floor represents a significant opportunity.",

TL;DR Summary: \u2022\tInsane Entry Price: Buying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s anchor investment (24p). \u2022\tThe NICE Catalyst: NICE hand-picked Speedboat to optimize NHS resources; legal mandate for funding expected Nov 19, 2026. \u2022\tTechnical Moat: Only tech to beat the \"heat-sink\" effect in lung/liver; 400+ patent moat. \u2022\tThe Math: 58% H2 revenue growth hitting a stabilized cost base makes a Jan 2027 breakeven a mathematical probability. Full Analysis: The current share price of ~14.5p is fundamentally broken and presents an absurd disconnect from operational reality. For private investors with a 12-24 month view, this is a classic \"inflection point\" setup. 1. The Technology Moat: Why it's \"Best-in-Class\" Creo isn't competing on price; they're competing on physics. Their Kamaptive platform is the only tech that miniaturizes microwave and RF energy into a single, tiny device. \u2022\tThe \"Heat-Sink\" Advantage: Competitors use RF energy, which fails in highly vascularized tissue (lung/liver) because blood flow cools the area (the \"heat-sink effect\"). Creo's 5.8GHz microwave energy avoids this, making it the superior clinical tool. \u2022\tThe NICE Selection: NICE specifically selected Speedboat Inject because they identified it as a key technology to ensure the \"best use of NHS resources.\" \u2022\tProven Savings: Real-world data showed the Speedboat procedure reduced hospital stays from 8.4 days to 1.1 days, saving the NHS nearly \u00a35,000 per procedure. 2. The Insider Signal: A Valuation Floor Chairman Kevin Crofton, who delivered a $2.3bn exit at his last company, put over \u00a31 million of his own cash into CREO in 2024/2025. \u2022\tHis initial anchor entry was 24p (\u00a3700k invested). \u2022\tBuying at ~14.5p is a 40% discount to the Chairman\u2019s primary entry price. If the man tasked with delivering the exit is buying at these levels, the current ~\u00a358m market cap is an anomaly. Continued......",

It rewards illusory, short term gains, even if they are externally generated, accidental, or pure luck. If personal greed is your incentive, you are probably WRONG for the business anyway, and wrong for society generally.",

The incredible thing is you make the decision and a month letter you are wondering why you ever had the 10 to 20% in the first place. Creo cannot raise more money, so every pound they have now should be treated like gold dust, R & D pruned to the bone, the focus sales, sales, sales. No hiring, no pay increases, haircuts for the board, all obvious and urgent stuff. It is extremely frustrating. Without urgent measures the company will not survive in its present form.

This should mean strong growth, further margin improvement, and ultimately to achieve break-even (EBITDA) in a few years. A broader range of devices (several commercial launches), potential future licensing opportunities for robotics (Kamaptive tech), and optionality with Micro-Tech, should underpin this path to break-even and beyond, while being well funded through to 2027.",

CMD takeaways: Market drivers intact: Large TAM of which it is focusing on a smaller portion ($1.5bn SAM). Clinical need for minimal invasive procedures ongoing, a shift from diagnosis to therapeutic, and from surgery to endoscopy suite. Positive physician feedback: We heard from 4 physicians who use Creo's products, speaking to the advantage of bipolar energy vs monopolar methods of delivering energy. The speakers pointed to several benefits of Creo\u2019s platform, namely lower total cost of care, safety, efficacy, shorter length of stay and faster learning process. Furthermore, the multimodal (cutting & coagulation) nature of its products is seen as an advantage over the competition, providing better economics. New product launches: Currently 8 products in multi-therapeutic areas, and will have a full suit of products available at the end of 2026/early 2027 (launching 4 new GI products in next 2 years). A dedicated CPT code in US for ESD from Jan 2027 should standardize national reimbursement and is key to unlocking US growth. With regards to Intuitive, MicroBlate feedback and data (not peer reviewed) is positive thus far, but needs to build more evidence, with studies ongoing, and this is a 2027 story. No new financial info: Reiterated guidance for 40-60% growth in FY25. Growth in next 12 months almost all from existing products (Speedboat, SpydrBlade and a little bit from MicroBlate). New products to contribute after that. Along with a right sized cost base, break-even EBITDA still expected in 2028 and believe sufficiently funded to get there.

The losses have only narrowed slightly, sales numbers have consistently come in like tales of the unexpected. 2028 is far far away, a kind of wishful fantasy where words mean what we want them to mean.

I\u2019ve had keyhole surgery on my oesophagus twice and while it\u2019s far better than being opened up with a large incision, the surgeon still has to make 5 puncture wounds to get all the kit in, including a gas tube to bloat you up so the surgeon can see what he\u2019s doing. Furthermore I needed separate visits for an endoscopy. Being able to have an endoscopy, then treatment through the endoscopy tube on the same day, then being able to leave that day would have been brilliant for me and the NHS given the well publicised bed shortages. Being opened up from the outside also introduces more risk of picking up an infection. What Creo enables, especially in treatment of lung and pancreatic cancer, feels like Dr Bones Star Trek stuff.",
