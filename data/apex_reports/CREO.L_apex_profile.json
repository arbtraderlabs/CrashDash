The Group has developed the CROMA powered by Kamaptive full-spectrum adaptive technology to optimise surgical capability and patient outcomes. Kamaptive is a seamless, intuitive integration of multi-modal energy sources, optimised to dynamically adapt to patient tissue during procedures such as resection, dissection, coagulation, and ablation of tissue. Kamaptive technology provides clinicians with increased flexibility, precision and controlled surgical solutions. CROMA currently delivers bipolar radiofrequency (\"RF\") energy for precise localised cutting and focused high frequency microwave (\"MW\") energy for controlled coagulation and ablation via a single accessory port. This technology, combined with the Group's range of patented electrosurgical devices, is designed to provide clinicians with flexible, accurate and controlled clinical solutions. The Directors believe the Company's technology can impact the landscape of surgery and endoscopy by providing a safer, less invasive and more cost-efficient option for procedures.\nFor more information, please refer to the website\nwww.creomedical.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Developed by Welsh med-tech company Creo Medical, this innovative device offers a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgery, significantly improving patient outcomes and recovery times.\nCurrently, patients with complex polyps often face multiple procedures or major surgery, which can result in lengthy recovery times and higher risks. The Speedboat device allows clinicians to perform a single, minimally invasive procedure to remove polyps effectively, reducing the need for surgery and enabling faster patient recovery. Introducing this technology addresses a critical gap in treatment services in Wales.\nDr. Alka Joshi, Clinical Lead for the pilot, commented:\n\"This pilot is a significant step forward for our patients. By utilising the Speedboat device, we can offer a more efficient, less invasive alternative to traditional surgical methods, improving outcomes and reducing waiting times.\"\nSince the pilot's launch before Christmas, three patients have undergone the treatment successfully with no recorded complications. Each procedure was completed in a single session, and all patients were discharged the same day. One patient even resumed normal activities, including Christmas shopping, the very next day.\nBacked by the Health Board's Clinical Safety and Effectiveness Group, the pilot is supported by Creo's on-site clinical education program, which reduces clinician training time from years to just months. This mentorship model enables ABUHB to embed the procedure at pace while ensuring safety and cost-effectiveness, creating a potential replicable blueprint for adoption across other health boards in Wales.\nRob Holcombe, Finance Director & Innovation Executive Lead at ABUHB, stated:\n\"We are proud to champion this innovative Welsh technology in ABUHB. The early success of this pilot highlights the Board's commitment to delivering solutions that enhance patient care, reduce pressure on surgical services and demonstrate ABUHB's approach to adopting medical innovation through 'value- based health care' outcome evaluation.\"\nThe ABUHB video can be viewed here:\nhttps://vimeo.com/1053790954\nCraig Gulliford, Chief Executive Officer of Creo, said:\n\"As a Welsh company, it is\nexciting that the Aneurin Bevan team\nare the first in Wales to use our Speedboat for the benefit of its colon cancer patients;\nthe SSD pilot in could enhance patient outcomes, reduce surgical waiting lists, and facilitate the wider adoption of this technique across other Health Boards in Wales.\n\"\nFor further information please contact:\nCreo Medical Group plc\nwww.creomedical.com\nRichard Craven, Company Secretary\nVia Walbrook PR\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nStephen Keys / Camilla Hume / George Lawson (NOMAD)\nMichael Johnson (Sales)\nDeutsche Numis (Joint Broker)\nFreddie Barnfield / Duncan Monteith / Euan Brown\n+44 (0)20 7260 1000\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: +44 (0)20 7933 8780 or\ncreo@walbrookpr.com\nPaul McManus / Alice Woodings\nPhillip Marriage\nMob: +44 (0)7980 541 893 /\n+44 (0)7407 804 654\nMob: +44 (0)7867 984 082\nAbout Creo Medical\nCreo is a medical device company focused on the development and commercialisation of minimally invasive electrosurgical devices, bringing advanced energy to endoscopy.\nThe Company's vision is to improve patient outcomes through the development and commercialisation of a suite of electrosurgical medical devices, each enabled by CROMA, powered by Kamaptive.
