After the end of the Period,\nJurassic World Evolution 3\nachieved an excellent sales performance in December, including a Frontier Christmas Day sales record for an individual game, to start the second half of the financial year strongly.\nThe success of\nJurassic World Evolution 3\nunderscores the enduring strength and scalability of the CMS model, and Frontier's ability to deliver compelling games for its player communities. Alongside the success of the new game, the\nJurassic World Evolution\ngame franchise benefitted in H1 from strong sales of\nJurassic World Evolution 2\nduring summer promotions, and ongoing sales of\nJurassic World Evolution\n.\nH1 sales for the\nPlanet Coaster\nfranchise were slightly ahead of expectations, building on proactive community engagement and new content for\nPlanet Coaster 2\n, including the\nSorcery Pack\nand free updates. With the\nToybox Pack\nlaunching post-period end in December to positive reception, the franchise is well positioned for long-term performance.\nPlanet Zoo\ndelivered an excellent revenue contribution in H1, becoming Frontier's highest grossing individual game by revenue, as it continues to lead in its genre and engage with a substantial community of players. This bodes well for its sequel, coming in FY27.\nDevelopment is progressing well on the unannounced CMS title scheduled for release in FY28, further strengthening the portfolio and support Frontier's strategy of delivering high-quality, evergreen franchises.\nOutside CMS, the ever-evolving\nElite Dangerous\nspace simulation game delivered revenue growth of over 50% versus the comparative period, driven by new content, ships, and sustained player engagement. Meanwhile, Frontier's team in Canada, Complex Games, are on track with the development of an unannounced game, which is scheduled for release in FY27.\nCEO APPOINTMENT - A SMOOTH TRANSITION\nAs first announced on 16 December 2025, Jonny Watts, who served as CEO from August 2022 and led Frontier's successful turnaround and strategic refocus on CMS games, formally stepped down as CEO on 1 January 2026. Jo Cooke, previously Chief Marketing Officer, assumed the CEO position and joined the Board on the same date, bringing extensive industry experience and having played a key role in the successful launch of\nJurassic World Evolution 3\n. Jonny will remain on the Board as an Executive Director until 31 May 2026 to support a smooth transition.\nTRADING AND OUTLOOK - GUIDANCE UPGRADE\nAfter the end of the Period, strong sales across the portfolio in seasonal price promotions delivered Frontier's second highest-ever December revenue. Based on Frontier's financial performance in the first seven months of the financial year, the Board are now upgrading FY26 financial guidance to revenue of around \u00a3100 million and Adjusted Operating Profit* of around \u00a311 million.\nJonny Watts, Executive Director and outgoing CEO, said:\n\"I'm incredibly proud of what Frontier has achieved in the first half of FY26 and in recent years. The success of Jurassic World Evolution 3 and the strength of our CMS portfolio are a testament to the talent and dedication of our team. I am delighted that we have successfully restored Frontier to a position of consistent, sustainable growth and profitability. Frontier is well placed for the future, and I look forward to supporting Jo and the team through this transition.\"\nJo Cooke, incoming CEO, said:\n\"As we look ahead, Frontier is in an excellent shape to build on the strong foundations established in recent years. I again want to thank Jonny for his leadership and the pivotal role he played in shaping our strategy and restoring growth. Jonny's efforts have left the business and our CMS-focused roadmap in a fantastic place for the future. With a talented team and a robust pipeline of exciting new games and additional content for existing games, we remain committed to this strategy, listening to our players and delivering exceptional experiences to them and long-term value for our shareholders.\"\nThere will be a call for analysts and institutional investors at 9:30am today.

Based in Cambridge, Frontier uses its proprietary COBRA game development technology to create innovative genre-leading games, primarily for personal computers and videogame consoles.\nFrontier's LEI number: 213800B9LGPWUAZ9GX18.\nwww.frontier.co.uk\nInterim Results Statement\nREVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT\nTotal revenue grew 26% to \u00a359.6 million (H1 FY25: \u00a347.3 million), led by the outstanding performance of\nJurassic World Evolution\n3\nand supported by the continued sales of Frontier's other genre-leading games.\nGross profit, being revenue less distribution costs and IP royalties, grew to \u00a338.0 million (H1 FY25: \u00a332.9 million), reflecting the growth in revenue. Gross profit margin reduced to 64% (H1 FY25: 70%), primarily due to the success of\nJurassic World Evolution 3,\nwhich increased the proportion of revenue from royalty-bearing licensed-IP games.\nOPERATING COSTS\nAdjusted operating costs, under the Adjusted Operating Profit* measure, increased slightly to \u00a328.6 million (H1 FY25: \u00a327.4 million), through the accrual of higher all-staff profit-related bonuses, which are due for payment in September 2026 based on profit for the full financial year. H1 profit grew by over 70% compared to H1 FY25.\nOperating costs under IFRS also increased slightly to \u00a330.5 million (H1 FY25: \u00a328.4 million), with the all-staff bonus accrual again being a contributory factor. Another reason for the increase was a fall in the proportion of development costs capitalised under IAS 38 to 69% (H1 FY25: 76%). This reflected the investment in free updates and upgrades for\nPlanet Coaster 2\ndelivered in the Period, the costs of which are not capitalised.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nAdjusted Operating Profit*, which reflects cash profitability with game development costs expensed as they are incurred, grew by 76% to \u00a39.7 million (H1 FY25: \u00a35.5 million) through the strong trading performance achieved in the Period.\nOperating profit also increased substantially under IFRS, up 73% to \u00a37.8 million (H1 FY25: \u00a34.5 million).\nIncluded in both Adjusted Operating Profit* and IFRS operating profit is other operating income of \u00a30.3 million (H1 FY25: nil), which relates to the sublet from July 2025 of a portion of Frontier's office on the Cambridge Science Park.\nCORPORATION TAX, TAX CREDITS AND R&D EXPENDITURE CREDITS\nIn arriving at the calculation of Adjusted Operating Profit*, a tax credit of \u00a32.9 million has been recognised (H1 FY25: \u00a33.4 million), which aligns the expected benefits of tax and R&D expenditure credits against the expenditure they relate to, in the period of the expenditure.\nUnder IFRS, accounting an income tax credit of \u00a327,000 was recognised in the Period (H1 FY25: \u00a3nil) for tax filings in Canada (Complex Games). As in previous years, an update will be provided in the full-year financial results in respect of the anticipated Video Games Tax Relief claim for qualifying development activities and the tax charge for the Group. Additional corporation tax disclosures will be provided in the FY26 Financial Statements.\nPROFIT AFTER TAX AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nProfit after tax grew to \u00a38.0 million (H1 FY25: \u00a34.4 million) and basic earnings per share grew to 21.4 pence (H1 FY25: 11.4 pence).\nCASH POSITION AND CASHFLOW\nFrontier continues to be well capitalised and has no debt, with a cash balance of \u00a340.1 million at 30 November 2025 (31 May 2025: \u00a342.5 million, 30 November 2024: \u00a327.2 million).\u00a0During the Period Frontier undertook a \u00a310.0 million share buyback programme to return surplus capital to shareholders, improve return on equity and increase earnings per share, while maintaining the financial headroom to invest in Frontier's growth strategy. Excluding the cash outflow of \u00a310.0 million for the share buyback, underlying cash grew by \u00a37.6 million through the strong trading performance achieved in the Period. Cash grew further during December through the receipt of November's net revenue, ending at \u00a343.4 million on 31 December 2025.\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 NOVEMBER

All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (\u00a3'000) except when otherwise indicated.\nGoing concern basis\nThe Group's and Company's forecasts and projections, taking account of current cash resources and reasonably possible changes in trading performance, support the conclusion that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of the consolidated interim financial statements. The Group and Company therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing their financial statements.\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted in the Group's most recent annual financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2025.\n4. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND KEY JUDGEMENTS\nWhen preparing the consolidated interim financial statements, management undertakes a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions about recognition and measurements of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe judgements, estimates and assumptions applied in the interim financial statements, including the key sources of estimation uncertainty, were the same as those applied in the Group's last annual financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2025.\n5. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the profits attributable to the shareholders of Frontier Developments plc divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the Period, excluding shares held in treasury.\nDuring the Period Frontier executed a share buyback programme of \u00a310 million, acquiring 2,518,527 shares which were placed into treasury. As at 30 November 2025, there were 39,478,535 shares in issue, including the shares held in treasury. The total number of voting rights in the Company as at 30 November was therefore 36,960,008.\n6 months to 30 November 2025\n6 months to 30 November 2024\n12 months to 31 May 2025\nProfit attributable to shareholders (\u00a3'000)\n8,012\n4,398\n16,387\nWeighted average number of shares\n37,439,862\n38,649,551\n38,658,275\nBasic earnings per share (p)\n21.4\n11.4\n42.4\nThe calculation of the diluted earnings per share is based on the profits attributable to the shareholders of Frontier Developments plc divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the Period, excluding shares held in treasury, and as adjusted for the dilutive effect of share options.\n6 months to 30 November 2025\n6 months to 30 November 2024\n12 months to 31 May 2025\nProfit attributable to shareholders (\u00a3'000)\n8,012\n4,398\n16,387\nDiluted weighted average number of shares\n39,640,870\n39,759,771\n40,265,330\nDiluted earnings per share (p)\n20.2\n11.1\n40.7\nThe reconciliation of the average number of Ordinary Shares used for basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows:\n6 months to 30 November 2025\n6 months to 30 November 2024\n12 months to 31 May 2025\nWeighted average number of shares\n37,439,862\n38,649,551\n38,658,275\nDilutive effect of share options\n2,201,008\n1,110,220\n1,607,055\nDiluted average number of shares\n39,640,870\n39,759,771\n40,265,330\n6.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS - NON-STATUTORY MEASURES\nIn addition to measures of financial performance derived from IFRS-reported results - revenue, operating profit, operating profit margin percentage, earnings per share, and cash balance - we have published and provided commentary on financial performance measurements derived from non-statutory calculations. We believe these supplementary measures, when read in conjunction with the measures derived directly from statutory financial reporting, provide a better understanding of our overall financial performance.\nAdjusted Operating Profit\nAdjusted Operating Profit measures Frontier's financial performance after eliminating non-cash development cost accounting adjustments (cost capitalisation, amortisation charges and impairment charges), non-cash share charges, non-operating items (including restructuring costs), and after recording the full benefits of development-related tax and R&D expenditure credits against the expenditure they relate to. This effectively provides the cash profit figure that would have been achieved if we expensed all game development investment as it was incurred, net of those tax and R&D expenditure credits, rather than capitalising those costs and amortising them over several years.\n6 months to\n30 November 2025\u00a3'000\n6 months to\n30 November 2024\u00a3'000\n12 months to 31 May 2025\u00a3'000\nOperating profit\n7,815\n4,543\n12,651\nAdd back non-cash intangible asset amortisation charges for game developments and game technology\n11,173\n10,944\n19,677\nDeduct capitalised investment costs in game developments and game technology\n(13,296)\n(14,601)\n(28,279)\nAdd back non-cash share-based payment expenses\n1,106\n1,248\n2,368\nAdjustment to record the full benefits of tax and R&D expenditure credits against the expenditure they relate to\n2,916\n3,384\n6,767\nAdjustments to tax and R&D expenditure credits of prior periods\n-\n-\n62\nAdjusted Operating Profit\n9,714\n5,518\n13,246\nEBITDA\nEBITDA, being earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, is commonly used by investors when assessing the financial performance of companies. It attempts to arrive at a 'cash profit' figure by adjusting operating profit for non-cash depreciation and amortisation charges. In our case, EBITDA does not provide a clear picture of our cash profitability, as it adds back amortisation charges relating to game developments, but without deducting the investment costs for those developments, resulting in a profit measure which does not take into account any of the costs associated with developing games. Since EBITDA is a commonly used financial performance measure, it has been included below for the benefit of readers of the accounts who may value that measure of performance.\n6 months to\n30 November 2025\u00a3'000\n6 months to\n30 November 2024\u00a3'000\n12 months to\n31 May 2025\u00a3'000\nOperating profit\n7,815\n4,543\n12,651\nDepreciation and amortisation\n13,652\n12,874\n23,435\nEBITDA\n21,467\n17,417\n36,086\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
