Upon the publication of this announcement via Regulatory Information Service (\"RIS\"), this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nAbout Cambridge Nutritional Sciences plc\nCambridge Nutritional Sciences plc (AIM: CNSL) is a specialist medical diagnostics company focused on industry-leading Health and Nutrition products.\nJames Cooper, Chief Executive Statement\nOverview\nSales in the first half of this fiscal year have not reached our expectations. The key regions we have seen sales fall against last year are in mainland Europe, Africa/Middle East and the Americas. We have experienced existing customers ordering lower volumes and new clients taking longer to place significant orders. This demonstrates the need to increase our pipeline further and focus on driving demand in these regions, as the feedback on our product and its appeal to customers remains positive. We are continuing to review our position amongst our competitors to ensure we are considered a top choice for Food IgG testing. The positive news on the sales side is that the UK and India continue to show good growth, both markets where we have more control of the laboratories and the sales teams. This growth demonstrates to us the substantial opportunity that exists in the other regions.\nFinancial Performance\nRevenue decreased 6.6% to \u00a33.9m (H1 2025: \u00a34.1m) which was below our expectations and driven by a slowness in orders in many of our key regions. We have seen year on year sales growth of 33% in India and 6% in the UK, with all other regions showing decreases. The biggest fall is in Europe with some distributors in France, Poland and Hungary ordering less in H1 than in previous years. The European market is one of the most competitive and we are exploring all options to ensure we continue to focus our sales coverage to the most appropriate regions.\nRevenue by product group:\n\u00a7\nSales of FoodPrint\u00ae decreased 7% to \u00a32.4m (H1 2025: \u00a32.6m)\n\u00a7\nSales of Food Detective\u00ae decreased 23% to \u00a30.6m (H1 2025: \u00a30.7m)\n\u00a7\nCNS Lab and other sales were up 9% to \u00a30.9m (H1 2025: \u00a30.9m)\nGross profit from operations decreased to \u00a32.6m (H1 2025: \u00a32.7m) with an improved gross margin percentage of 67.7% (H1 2025: 65.4%). The increase in margin principally reflects the continued improvements in production yields as well as a higher proportion of high margin FoodPrint\u00ae tests in the product mix. Despite the competition and pressure to reduce price, the Board is confident that Food Print\u00ae margins can continue at this improved level in H2 FY25 as the Company benefits from the enhanced operational efficiencies.\nOverheads increased by 4% to \u00a32.6m (H1 2025: \u00a32.5m). This increase is directly attributed to an increase in investment in our sales, marketing and leadership team from H2 FY25 showing full year effect in H1 FY26. We do anticipate some of these costs will increase in the second half as the restructuring work referred to below in more detail will most likely incur some additional costs.\nThe Group continues to consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for exceptional items and share-based payments) as being the appropriate measures of profitability being aligned with the cash generating activities of the business. The adjusted EBITDA was \u00a30.1m (H1 2025: \u00a30.2m). The \u00a30.1m for exceptional items is related to compensation for loss of office and share related payments.\nThe cash balance on 30 September 2025 was \u00a33.6m (H1 2025: \u00a34.5m, 31 March 2025: \u00a34.9m) and fell from the March 2025 year-end position as a result of outflows from working capital (\u00a30.7m), capital expenditure predominantly in new machinery/systems (\u00a30.4m) and financing activities (\u00a30.1m). The capital expenditure includes the purchase of a new machine to manufacture FoodPrint as well as investment in our new LIMS system, work on our new website and IVDR project. In the previous financial year we experienced a similar reduction in cash from March year end to September half year.\nOperational Update\nThe historic work undertaken in creating efficiencies in producing our tests and servicing our test results in the laboratory in the UK, has resulted in excellent performance improvements in operations, and updates to sample collection packs, upgrading our Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)system and processes and related projects demonstrates the urgency with which this work continues. The 2.3% gross margin increase is a direct result of this work\n. We are very proud of our operations team based in Littleport and are confident they will deliver even more improvements for the remaining year.\nThe MyHealth Tracker App we have been operating has been used less frequently as customers have started to use their own Apps. This App has therefore been suspended for new customers whilst we explore what additional and new information our new LIMS system can produce for the benefit of all our customers.\nStrategic Priorities\nDriving more sales from existing and new customers is our number one priority.\nThe Board asked management to undertake a restructure of the existing Sales team to improve focus and attention on customers, and reduce the span of activities undertaken by our salespeople. The restructure has been completed and involved separating the customer service and customer success functions from the sales team so once a new or existing client signs a contract or places orders they can be serviced by these teams, with the sales team moving onto the next customer. These teams will help with new installations, overseas stock levels and ordering requirements as well as any other issues that may arise. They will work closely with distributors and laboratories to make using our test processes and systems a smooth and easy operation. The customer acquisition team, who are based in the regions, will help drive more demand for our products in the overseas regions directly into these laboratories. This restructure commenced recently and we will let you know in our next update at year end how it is working. At the moment the plans are to rearrange existing teams to complete this restructure with the additional headcount needed being one or two people at most.\nIn terms of regions of focus, the UK, Europe, Americas and Asia (especially India) remain our key markets. Progress in the Americas is much slower than we had hoped, but we remain confident this market will deliver good growth in the future. The laboratories we have signed are taking longer than planned to commence our tests, but we have some local support, as part of the customer acquisition team, to help drive more traffic into the laboratories for our tests. We recently changed this local support as the previous support was not delivering.\nWe saw robust growth in our UK market, with 6% growth in the first half on last year coming on top of the 8% growth reported last year. This growth is coming mainly from the direct consumer demand serviced by our white-label partners, and demonstrates the increasing awareness of how direct consumer marketing generates more demand for our tests in the UK. We believe this bodes well for overseas markets also. In India, the business has grown 33% in sterling value in the first half which translates to over 40% in local currency, demonstrating how well our tests are received in that markets where our local sales team are growing fast to drive even more growth. At over 10% of our overall sales, this market is one we are looking for even more sales growth.\nIn August we launched a new product called\u00a0Gut Detective\u00ae which is for our UK practitioner market only at the outset. Gut Detective is a comprehensive stool biomarker panel used by practitioners to investigate key areas of gut health, including inflammation, digestive enzyme production and intestinal permeability. This noninvasive testing solution helps identify underlying imbalances and supports targeted, personalised treatment plans. Gut Detective combines multiple functional stool markers into a single, convenient panel. It provides a detailed picture of a patient's digestive health, helping to uncover potential causes of persistent symptoms that may not show up on routine tests. Each test is CE-marked and analysed in the CNSLab, ensuring trusted clinical accuracy. It's an ideal tool for practitioners specialising in nutrition, gut health, functional medicine, or integrative care.\nCurrent trading and Outlook\nWe acknowledge sales in the first half have been disappointing as the Company builds its sales focus to operate a multi-channel multi-regional approach. We have seen the difficulties in some of our larger regions and are expecting a slow recovery in these areas, accordingly our full year revenues will show a modest decline compared to the prior year\n.\nHowever gross margin is expected to hold strong and with careful cost management we expect to remain profitable for the full year at the adjusted EBITDA level. That will require a lot of careful management of the team and costs to achieve, without taking our focus off the need to deliver more sales and orders.\nAs a result of the above, we anticipate the cash position will decline in H2, as further capital expenditure is expected as we continue to invest in the long term potential of the business. However, we believe we have more than sufficient working capital to execute on our strategy and return the Company to growth with a healthy gross margin.\nThe Board's expectations are that the medium term growth opportunities remain significant and the Company is well capitalised to deliver growth in the years ahead.\nConsolidated Statement of\u00a0Comprehensive Income\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n6 months ended.\n30 September 2025\n6 months ended.\n30 September 2024\n12 months ended.\n31 March 2025\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n2\n3,863\n4,134\n8,330\nCost of sales\n(1,248)\n(1,432)\n(2,889)\nGross profit\n2,615\n2,702\n5,441\nAdministration costs\n(2,169)\n(2,263)\n(4,680)\nSelling and marketing costs\n(839)\n(617)\n(1,436)\nOther income\n96\n26\n280\nOperating loss before exceptional items\n(297)\n(152)\n(395)\nExceptional items\n(138)\n(117)\n1,831\nOperating profit/(loss) after exceptional items\n(435)\n(269)\n1,436\nFinance income/(costs)\n3\n38\n73\n130\nProfit/(Loss) before taxation\n(397)\n(196)\n1,566\nTax credit\n4\n-\n-\n-\nProfit/(Loss) for the period\n(397)\n(196)\n1,566\nOther comprehensive profit/(losses) to be reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods\nExchange differences on translation of foreign operations\n(33)\n(17)\n(25)\nOther comprehensive income for the period\n(33)\n(17)\n(25)\nTotal comprehensive profit/(losses) for the period\n(430)\n(213)\n1,541\nEarnings per share (EPS)\nBasic and diluted EPS on profit/(loss) for the period\n5\n(0.2)p\n(0.1)p\n0.7p\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nas at 30 September 2025\n30 September 2025\n30 September 2024\n31 March 2025\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nASSETS\nNon-current assets\nIntangibles\n6\n3,805\n4,039\n3,821\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n7\n670\n485\n535\nRight of use assets\n7\n175\n76\n226\nDeferred taxation\n1,406\n1,400\n1,406\nTotal non-current assets\n6,056\n6,000\n5,988\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n729\n776\n829\nTrade and other receivables\n2,311\n2,208\n1,965\nCash and cash equivalents\n3,594\n4,520\n4,868\nTotal current assets\n6,634\n7,504\n7,662\nTotal assets\n12,690\n13,504\n13,650\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nEquity\nShare capital\n10,255\n10,255\n10,255\nShare premium\n25,072\n25,072\n25,072\nRetained deficit\n(24,154)\n(25,710)\n(23,833)\nTranslation reserve\n(118)\n(77)\n(85)\nTotal equity\n11,055\n9,540\n11,409\nLiabilities\nNon-current liabilities\nLong-term borrowings\n-\n-\n-\nLease liabilities\n75\n-\n126\nDeferred income\n-\n2,500\n-\nTotal non-current liabilities\n75\n2,500\n126\nCurrent liabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n62\n3\n123\nLease liabilities\n100\n76\n100\nTrade and other payables\n1,398\n1,203\n1,892\nTotal current liabilities\n1,560\n1,282\n2,115\nLiabilities directly associated with assets held for sale\n-\n182\n-\nTotal liabilities\n1,635\n3,964\n2,241\nTotal equity and liabilities\n12,690\n13,504\n13,650\nConsolidated Statement of\u00a0Changes in Equity\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nShare\nShare\nRetained\nTranslation\ncapital\npremium\ndeficit\nreserve\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nBalance at 31 March 2024\n10,255\n25,072\n(25,585)\n(60)\n9,682\nLoss for the period to 30 September 2024\n-\n-\n(196)\n-\n(196)\nOther comprehensive losses -

Our revenues in H1 have not been helped by some regions, mainland Europe in particular, ordering less than in previous years.\n\u00b7\nUSA Laboratories are taking longer to commercialise FoodPrint\u00ae but we are seeing encouraging signs.\n\u00b7\nThe Company remains well-funded to deliver on our strategic objectives, with cash being invested to drive new initiatives including IVDR development and new\nGut Detective\u00ae product.\n\u00b7\nThe Board remains confident and focused on driving new and existing sales as the primary objective for H2 and the year thereafter and is increasingly spending more of its time on this area.\n\u00b7\nOut of this has come a complete restructure of the sales team and its operations, splitting out the roles of customer service, acquisition and customer success from the sales function so they can focus primarily on signing new distributors and laboratories and driving more sales from existing customers. This feeding of the funnel is paramount to future sales growth.\n1\nAdjusted for exceptional items, amortisation of intangible assets and share based payment charges.\n2See Segment Information note 2.\nCommenting on the results, Carolyn Rand, Chair, said:\n\"The first half of this year has been frustrating. We have seen some regions showing good growth, particularly where we are closer to the end user,\u00a0whilst other key areas have not achieved their budget.\nWe have therefore implemented a restructure of the sales teams to ensure more focus is given to understand the markets more deeply and deliver on customer needs and demands. This will take a little time to embed so we do not expect the second half to show any significant improvements.\nThe positive news is that despite lower sales we have continued to grow our gross margin by another 2.3% in the first half and that profitability in the business continues at the adjusted EBITDA level, demonstrating the excellent work laying the foundations in these areas over the last few years.\nWe remain confident in the long term future of CNSL as the new sales team structure beds in and starts to deliver\"\nInvestor presentation\nJames Cooper CEO and Ajay Patel CFO will provide a live presentation relating to the\u00a0Interim Results\u00a0via the Investor Meet Company platform today at 16:00 GMT.

We have improved internal processes, built and delivered new core systems, reorganised the structure and aligned the company culture towards quality and future growth. The benefit of this will\nallow the company the ability to deliver successfully for the long term, creating a bright future. None of that could have been achieved without the hard work and dedication from the whole of the CNS team. This was undertaken against a backdrop of considerable change, and challenge. I want to thank the team and acknowledge the great effort that has\nbeen made over the last year to reenergise and build the company for a strong future.\nBusiness performance\nTotal income growth to \u00a311.1 million (2024: \u00a39.9 million) was notable, whilst revenue falling to \u00a38.3 million (2024 \u00a39.8 million) was below expectations.\nThe improvements in gross margin to 65.3% (2024: 61.9%) and significant cost controls to drive an improved adjusted EBITDA of \u00a30.4 million (2024: \u00a30.2 million) were notable.\nThe company has looked to reduce headcount in key areas where efficient processes have decreased resourcing requirements whilst also taking the opportunity to review underperforming staff. This exercise is important as changing the culture and professionalising the company remains one of our central focuses. This has not deflected from the company recognising the need to strengthen its teams which has led to the recruitment of some key roles.\nAll expenses are now well controlled, allowing the company to improve profitability. This vigour, together with the enhanced gross margin, are the main reasons adjusted EBITDA has doubled in the year, a result we are all very proud of.\nThis has all b",

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nCambridge Nutritional Sciences plc\n(the 'Company' or 'CNS')\nTrading Update\nCNS (AIM: CNSL), the specialist medical diagnostics company focused on promoting a personalised and functional approach to health and nutrition, is pleased to announce an update on the Group's trading for the year ended 31 March 2025, ahead of the release of its audited final results in July 2025.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nTotal Income expected to be c.\u00a311.1m (2024: \u00a39.9m) representing a 12% increase on prior year. This includes \u00a32.5m of exceptional income recognised as a result of the successful outcome from the DHSC settlement. Revenue excluding exceptional and other income is \u00a38.3m (2024: \u00a39.8m).\n\u00b7\nGross profit margin of c.65% (2024: 61.9%).\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA1\u00a0expected to show profit of \u00a30.4m (2024: profit of \u00a30.2m).\n\u00b7\nProfit before tax is expected to be c.\u00a31.6m (2024: \u00a30.75m loss).\n\u00b7\nNet cash balance of \u00a34.9m (2024: \u00a35.4m).\n1\nAdjusted for exceptional items and share based payment charges.\n2025 Financial performance:\nAlthough total revenue is better than expected at \u00a311.1m with the successful resolution of the DHSC case, the Group expects to report revenue excluding exceptionals and other income for the year ending 31 March 2025 at \u00a38.3m. This is a little lower than expected but has not impacted the full year Adjusted EBITDA which is in line with market expectations.\nGross profit margin of c.65% (2024: 61.9%) has increased significantly with yields enhanced following continued investment in production and operational improvements and an ongoing focus to reduce scrap costs.\nOverheads have been well managed with additional improvements in cost control in all departments, whilst ensuring there is a concerted investment in the sales and marketing team to help grow revenue in the future, via the creation and development of an active pipeline.\nThis continued focus on efficiencies and cost control had resulted in an expected Adjusted EBITDA1\u00a0of \u00a30.4m (2024: profit of \u00a30.2m), which is ahead of expectations.\nOutlook:\nThe new financial year has started positively as the growing revenue pipeline starts to flow through. This is early evidence of the more target focused delivery of the revenue strategy for FY26 and is aided by a solid sales position completed in the UK in FY25.\nOther key markets for the Company include Europe, the USA and India where CNS is developing some strong distributor relationships to drive demand from laboratories as well as end users and healthcare practitioners.\nFurther investments in production and the laboratory are anticipated to deliver additional improvements in yield and efficiency respectively. This will help further improve the gross margin and increase capacity.\nFinally, as the growing pipeline and markets of operation develop, the Company has recognised the need to ensure people, processes and infrastructure development is strengthened and as a result have expanded the leadership and some broader teams to incorporate more experience and understanding of these key areas.\nThe decision on 22 May 2025 by the Exeter Magistrates Court to fine the Company \u00a30.035m regarding historical breaches of Health & Safety regulations in 2018 is seen positively as ending all known legal disputes, allowing the Company to focus on improving business performance. This fine, and associated costs, will be treated as exceptional in the reported year and so have no impact on the key adjusted EBITDA performance indicator.\nJames Cooper, CEO, commented that\n:\u00a0\"I am pleased with our performance in 2025, delivering good solid profit even before we see the benefit of our new sales pipeline coming through its long sales cycle. It is a very exciting time for food sensitivity testing in a global market when gut health diagnostics are showing signs of growth. I want to personally thank all our people and acknowledge all their hard work and effort in the last year. Looking forward, Cambridge Nutritional Sciences is in a very strong position from a product and team perspective, with significant cash resources and the prospects for revenue and profitability growth in 2026 and beyond.\"\nContacts:\nCambridge Nutritional Sciences PLC\nwww.cnsplc.com\nJames Cooper, Chief Executive\u00a0Officer\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nGeoff Nash / Edward Whiley (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks / Harriet Ward (ECM)\nAbout Cambridge Nutritional Sciences plc\nCambridge Nutritional Sciences plc (AIM: CNSL) is a specialist medical diagnostics company focused on industry-leading Healt",

The breaches relate to Omega South West, a company previously owned by Omega Diagnostics Limited. Omega South West was sold in 2018 and therefore is no longer a trading entity of the Company.\nIn March 2025, Omega Diagnostics entered guilty pleas in respect of the four identified breaches. At yesterday's sentencing hearing the court found that there was no deliberate breach or flagrant disregard for the law, found no aggravating factors, and found substantial mitigating factors including: no previous convictions, good health and safety record, full cooperation, sincere regret expressed, and breaches over only a narrow window of time. The court also gave full credit for early guilty pleas. The court imposed a total fine of \u00a30.035m in respect of all charges.\nWith this outcome, the matter is now formally concluded\nwith no further liability or legal action expected in relation to this case.\nThe financial impact of the fine has been fully provided for within the Group's existing provisions. As such, there will be no material effect on the Company's financial performance for the current or future financial years.

The agreement reached is in full and final settlement of all claims held by either party arising from the Letter of Intent and Contract. Each party will bear its own legal costs, which in the case of Omega, are expected to be circa \u00a30.2m for the year ending 31st March 2025 (to be recorded as an exceptional item in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income).\nThe result of the settlement will allow \u00a32.5m of 'Deferred Income' held in the group balance sheet to be reclassified as 'Other exceptional Income' for the year ending 31st March 2025. This movement will not impact the Company's key KPI of adjusted EBITDA as this income and its associated costs are exceptional in nature and so are not indicative of the current underlying business performance.\nContacts:\nCambridge Nutritional Sciences plc\nwww.cnsplc.com\nCarolyn Rand, Non-Executive Chair\ninvestors@cnsplc.com\nJames Cooper, Interim Chief Executive\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: 020 7220 0500\nGeoff Nash / Edward Whiley / (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks / Harriet Ward (ECM)\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU) 596/2014 AS IT FORMS PART OF UK DOMESTIC LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018 (\"MAR\") AND IS DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 17 OF MAR\nAbout Cambridge Nutritional Sciences plc\nCambridge Nutritional Sciences plc (AIM: CNSL) is a\nspecialist medical diagnostics company focused on promoting a personalised and functional approach to health and nutrition.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The continued operational improvements and workforce rationalization also helped us reduce our overheads by 17%, allowing adjusted EBITDA to improve to \u00a30.2m, while maintaining stable cash balances at \u00a34.5m. Q1 sales were softer than expected as some customers are working on one off reductions in their stock holdings to manage external forces, and in addition now that they trust the product and our improved delivery service, revenue has normalized following an abnormal backlog of orders in the previous year, which decreased to \u00a34.1m but is well ahead of H1 2023's \u00a33.4m.\nFollowing on from the success of improving operations and production capacity our operational focus is now shifting towards sales and marketing; this includes development and expansion for the UK and overseas markets to develop the pipeline and expand our customer base. Although the sales cycles are long, the focus has already greatly improved our qualified pipeline, and this gives us confidence in our future delivery.\nA strategic marketing priorit",

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

Let's break this down: \"For most of this afternoon the stock was 'at best' only on any size, another nutritional company yesterday informed the market their results would beat expectations by some margin,\" Is this like one of the CAPTCHA tests where we select a sentence from a random words? You word salad makes no sense. But it is amusing because.... \"this has to be a positive for CNSL being in the same sector.\" what a leap you've made. LOOK A COMPANY IN ROUGHLY THE SAME SECTOR IS DOING WELL. Now, let me try and make this simple enough for you to understand. H50 is running a kids disco for some chav kids birthday party. The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

They have tried for years and can't do it. They get a dart out and a map every trading update...i lost track of which was the last lucky country. The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

These packages can be expensive, leading some to characterize the process as a form of \"pay-to-play\" marketing, even if the basic award itself is free. Nomination Process: Nominations often come from the in-house research team or third parties, meaning a business may be \"alerted\" that they've won an award without actively seeking it or knowing they were nominated. Perceived Value: The value of the award is debated. Some winners express genuine pride in the recognition, viewing it as a testament to their hard work and a boost to credibility and employee morale. Others consider the unsolicited awards to be \"bogus\" or a \"scam\" if the recipient hasn't even started their business yet, suggesting the vetting process is not rigorous enough. In summary, GHP awards are not an outright scam, as an assessment process does exist and the basic recognition is free. However, businesses should be aware that the primary goal of the program appears to be selling optional, high-cost promotional opportunities, and the perceived prestige may vary within the industry.",

The posts I make are well researched and drawn from decades of experience at senior levels. It is why I get the important calls right. I have said to you before why I post. It is because CNSL is like many other businesses I come across. The UK has thousands of SMBs. So I find the ups and mainly downs to be interesting. I post here when I am procrastinating or on boring calls. It would blow your fuzzy little heads if you knew what I did and for whom. Again, I find this amusing. Perhaps you should be more grateful to be in the virtual company of modest genius? Anyway, it is Friday so I wish you a nice weekend. Chin chin.",

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

Let's break this down: \"For most of this afternoon the stock was 'at best' only on any size, another nutritional company yesterday informed the market their results would beat expectations by some margin,\" Is this like one of the CAPTCHA tests where we select a sentence from a random words? You word salad makes no sense. But it is amusing because.... \"this has to be a positive for CNSL being in the same sector.\" what a leap you've made. LOOK A COMPANY IN ROUGHLY THE SAME SECTOR IS DOING WELL. Now, let me try and make this simple enough for you to understand. H50 is running a kids disco for some chav kids birthday party. The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

Let's break this down: \"For most of this afternoon the stock was 'at best' only on any size, another nutritional company yesterday informed the market their results would beat expectations by some margin,\" Is this like one of the CAPTCHA tests where we select a sentence from a random words? You word salad makes no sense. But it is amusing because.... \"this has to be a positive for CNSL being in the same sector.\" what a leap you've made. LOOK A COMPANY IN ROUGHLY THE SAME SECTOR IS DOING WELL. Now, let me try and make this simple enough for you to understand. H50 is running a kids disco for some chav kids birthday party. The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

They have tried for years and can't do it. They get a dart out and a map every trading update...i lost track of which was the last lucky country. The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

I think CNSL has several macro economic challenges with a relatively new sales team. My hunch is that T/O will be less than H1 2024/5 of 4.1m. Will be interesting to find out. I agree that the toxic non entities are likely up to no good again. Vile characters that deserve the rubbish existence they live in. Although it always makes me smile when I see a fuzzy headed green stripe soon after posting. I can only imagine the tripe it is posting to hide its toxicity.

These packages can be expensive, leading some to characterize the process as a form of \"pay-to-play\" marketing, even if the basic award itself is free. Nomination Process: Nominations often come from the in-house research team or third parties, meaning a business may be \"alerted\" that they've won an award without actively seeking it or knowing they were nominated. Perceived Value: The value of the award is debated. Some winners express genuine pride in the recognition, viewing it as a testament to their hard work and a boost to credibility and employee morale. Others consider the unsolicited awards to be \"bogus\" or a \"scam\" if the recipient hasn't even started their business yet, suggesting the vetting process is not rigorous enough. In summary, GHP awards are not an outright scam, as an assessment process does exist and the basic recognition is free. However, businesses should be aware that the primary goal of the program appears to be selling optional, high-cost promotional opportunities, and the perceived prestige may vary within the industry.",

It can impact consumer behaviour especially among the gullible and improve morale within a business. However if a niche award is the only thing the toxic green stripe is discussing  things must be bad. Barrels are being scraped. I note no RNS. That means the second lab contract in the IS hasnt happened nor any significant strategic sales contracts. That means hitting existing channels. Hmm.

The posts I make are well researched and drawn from decades of experience at senior levels. It is why I get the important calls right. I have said to you before why I post. It is because CNSL is like many other businesses I come across. The UK has thousands of SMBs. So I find the ups and mainly downs to be interesting. I post here when I am procrastinating or on boring calls. It would blow your fuzzy little heads if you knew what I did and for whom. Again, I find this amusing. Perhaps you should be more grateful to be in the virtual company of modest genius? Anyway, it is Friday so I wish you a nice weekend. Chin chin.",

So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

The 2 areas which had shown growth in their sales. I think I have previously posted the amount of people who live in India, over 1 Billion people. Yes,  not a very big % of these people needed to start buying product to see the growth. I also wonder if the government in India will be interested especially with the deals done between India and Britain recently.",

You word salad makes no sense. But it is amusing because.... \"this has to be a positive for CNSL being in the same sector.\" what a leap you've made. LOOK A COMPANY IN ROUGHLY THE SAME SECTOR IS DOING WELL. Now, let me try and make this simple enough for you to understand. H50 is running a kids disco for some chav kids birthday party. The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that.

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you.

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium. Recent director buys, albeit small were at 2.4p,  buying the dips here can often reward significantly as the SP can move up fast, on two occasions this year the price has moved from current levels to 4p within a short space of time. Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.",

Well maybe not rocket yet, but approaching 1m shares in the 2 days. This after the usual hand holders posting more false/inaccurate content. \"Captain Swag posted Atan he might just be trying to create a bit of froth. Hoping no one actually checked that it was only \u00a33k.\" Well it seems The Swagman was incorrect once again, but is he responsible for any of the buys today? Not very good posting like that, if he is in my opinion. This has been said before on here and being posted on another board that the share moves fast. I did post yesterday about a Christmas present, well let's see. I did post on 19 Nov 'Ne oublie\" Will it or won't it, let's see Captain Swag. \ud83e\udd13",

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

You word salad makes no sense. But it is amusing because.... \"this has to be a positive for CNSL being in the same sector.\" what a leap you've made. LOOK A COMPANY IN ROUGHLY THE SAME SECTOR IS DOING WELL. Now, let me try and make this simple enough for you to understand. H50 is running a kids disco for some chav kids birthday party. The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium. Recent director buys, albeit small were at 2.4p,  buying the dips here can often reward significantly as the SP can move up fast, on two occasions this year the price has moved from current levels to 4p within a short space of time.

Hoping no one actually checked that it was only \u00a33k.\" Well it seems The Swagman was incorrect once again, but is he responsible for any of the buys today? Not very good posting like that, if he is in my opinion. This has been said before on here and being posted on another board that the share moves fast. I did post yesterday about a Christmas present, well let's see. I did post on 19 Nov 'Ne oublie\" Will it or won't it, let's see Captain Swag. \ud83e\udd13",

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

You word salad makes no sense. But it is amusing because.... \"this has to be a positive for CNSL being in the same sector.\" what a leap you've made. LOOK A COMPANY IN ROUGHLY THE SAME SECTOR IS DOING WELL. Now, let me try and make this simple enough for you to understand. H50 is running a kids disco for some chav kids birthday party. The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

Cash burn  could be a combination of the sales  reorganisation and the new gut detective R&D (which will have tax benefits). So nothing to panic over  - although it gives them 2 years at the current rate. It is good to see they have reorganised the sales team but reading between the lines it would seem that (as I have highlighted in the past) manufacturing companies aren't always the best at running sales teams. It seems they went for a \"hit and hope\" global strategy which is fatal. An American buyer is very different to a European buyer. A sales team not performing after 6 months won't perform unless changed. Sales people are different from account managers. Never the twain should meet because they ALWAYS retreat to the comfort zone of existing clients. (This is very expensive advice give to you gratis). Interesting.",

The issue is that crystal shops in UK might attract a nice middle class eco warrior but this is not going to fool countries that either are more money savvy or less diosable income. India has been on the radar for awhile with no success...what in reality is going to change? Sales this year will be down - they already told us. Cash us burning and without any exceptional items like last year will go down further. Sooner or later they will need to place. They will need to consolidate before that. One year or two ..it is going to happen. Creepy can print this post out with all the rest I make .. And then say that I told you all so",

          "content": "Today's economic figures aren't good for CNSL. The UK market is key for CNSL despite it being near saturation. Discretionary spending is clearly taking a hit. The crystal gazing market has some robustness against this (a fool and its money) but my suspicion is that they will be like many other SME and seeing a fall in sales in the UK market. So how about its international ambitions? The US dollar has and continues to weaken against sterling. Trading is still tough for importers with tariffs and the general political mood music. I think sales are static at best. India was also another target (assuming that is what you are implying Captain). This third world country is growing fast with strong increases across most markets. However, two factors should be considered. First the huge disparity in wealth distribution. The average salary is still $2,670. That's per year. If it was per day it is only a decent day rate. Per month the UKs benefits scroungers would blanche. Although a new lower middle class (the sort CNSL need) is growing it doesn't seem consistent based on the figures I'm seeing. From a healthcare perspective basics like clean drinking water is beyond the majority. Basic food hygiene is a significant issue across the whole country. For most people in the country finding out food intolerances using a test with questionable scientific credibility may seem a bit far fetched. A growing market and an opportunity? Yes. Enough to save CNSL from the issues in other markets? Nope. I don't think so. This is before we get into the challenges of running a sales team, something that it would seem CNSL are struggling with (as predicted by your friendly genius). We are just over 3 months away from  the end of year for CNSL. A trading update should arrive around May but I am going to call this now. 1) They are going to turn over less than \u00a38 million. - lowest since 2022/3 FY is looking likely. 2) They are going to hold less than \u00a33 million in cash. On the plus side (because the idiots rarely get to the end) the changes to ISAs in 2027 may help them but that is a LONG way away. LOL.",

Let's break this down: \"For most of this afternoon the stock was 'at best' only on any size, another nutritional company yesterday informed the market their results would beat expectations by some margin,\" Is this like one of the CAPTCHA tests where we select a sentence from a random words? You word salad makes no sense. But it is amusing because.... \"this has to be a positive for CNSL being in the same sector.\" what a leap you've made. LOOK A COMPANY IN ROUGHLY THE SAME SECTOR IS DOING WELL. Now, let me try and make this simple enough for you to understand. H50 is running a kids disco for some chav kids birthday party. The birthday cake has 10 slices. Each child is given a slice but then \"billy big balls\" takes Brooklyn, Luke, Shane and Tylers slice from them. Question - Because Billy is doing well on the cake consumption part does that mean Luke, Shane and Tyler are also doing well? LOL. What a total loser you must be. My guess is you're a \"cash in hand\" sort. \"After the late tick up there were only \u00a35k of shares were available online, after that they wanted a premium.\" Are you clearing up after the green stripes horse bets? Must be because that is GRADE A manure. \"Could be a good time to add or for any new onlookers buy in for a trade.\" I wait with bated breath to see your buys roll in. You've called this wrong for so long I am starting to feel sorry for you. Then I remember that you never listen and never learn and therefore think that Soylent Green is actually a pretty good idea.",

Well maybe not rocket yet, but approaching 1m shares in the 2 days. This after the usual hand holders posting more false/inaccurate content. \"Captain Swag posted Atan he might just be trying to create a bit of froth. Hoping no one actually checked that it was only \u00a33k.\" Well it seems The Swagman was incorrect once again, but is he responsible for any of the buys today? Not very good posting like that, if he is in my opinion. This has been said before on here and being posted on another board that the share moves fast. I did post yesterday about a Christmas present, well let's see. I did post on 19 Nov 'Ne oublie\" Will it or won't it, let's see Captain Swag. \ud83e\udd13",
