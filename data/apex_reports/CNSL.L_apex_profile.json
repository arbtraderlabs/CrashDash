The production challenges previously reported have been overcome and we have now cleared the sales backlog. We are delivering on our strategic objectives and have now established ourselves as a standalone business focused on Health and Nutrition under our new name of Cambridge Nutritional Sciences Plc ('CNS'). The market we serve remains exciting with a significant opportunity for global growth as more people are aware of their personalised health and its link to nutrition.\nFinancial Performance\nRevenue increased 44.0% to \u00a34.9m (H1: \u00a33.4m) helped by both production and yield improvements of FoodPrint\u00ae enabling the clearing of the sales backlog arising from the FY23 production issues. FY24 revenue is expected to be in line with expectations.\nRevenue by product group:\n\u00a7\nSales of FoodPrint\u00ae increased 47.0% to \u00a33.3m (H1 2022: \u00a32.2m)\n\u00a7\nSales of Food Detective\u00ae were \u00a30.7m in line with the prior year\n\u00a7\nCNS Lab and other sales were up 97.0% to \u00a30.9m (H1 2022: \u00a30.4m)\nGross profit from operations increased to \u00a33.1m (H1 2022: \u00a31.9m) with an improved gross margin percentage of 62.7% (H1 2022: 54.0%). The increase in margin principally reflects the improvements in production yields as well as a higher proportion of high margin FoodPrint\u00ae tests in the product mix. The Board is confident that Food Print\u00ae margins will continue at this improved level in H2 FY24 as the Company benefits from the enhanced operational efficiencies.\nOverheads increased by 31% to \u00a33.5m (H1 2022: restated \u00a32.7m). \u00a30.3m from underlying period growth with the balance related to one-time investment of the operational improvement project and business realignment, and a \u00a30.1m FX headwind.\nThe Group continues to consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for exceptional items and share-based payments) as being the appropriate measures of profitability being aligned with the cash generating activities of the business. The adjusted EBITDA was \u00a30.0m (H1 2022: loss of \u00a30.2m). The \u00a30.3m adjustment for exceptional items is related to realigning the group for the future.\nThe cash balance on 30 September 2023 was \u00a34.4m (H1 2022: \u00a32.7m, 31 March 2023: \u00a35.1m).\nOperational Update\nEarlier in the year we were pleased to report that the production challenges announced have been resolved,\nafter working\nwith industry specialists, Chartwell Consulting ('Chartwell') over the six-month period to embed new working processes. The result is that FoodPrint\u00ae production yields have increased and are significantly higher than the preceding six months, demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nimproved measures.\nThese newly implemented measures, alongside management changes, have allowed us to address the order backlog and the market's demand for food sensitivity tests remains strong. As part of this process, and in our drive to constantly seek operational improvements, we now have a permanent continuous improvement function in our operations department to promote further efficiency and productivity across the business.\nHistorically the business support systems were delivered from the group in Scotland, and we are now in the final steps post separating the business. Operationally we continue to evaluate alternative technologies for our flagship product, FoodPrint\u00ae, to ensure the long-term future of the product.\nStrategic Priorities\nThe MyHealthTracker App ('the App'), announced in March 2023, is designed for use on both iOS and Android platforms and will give us a direct connection to customers. It has been rolled out across the UK with selected health care professionals and their customers and initial feedback shows that the product has been well received by both groups. We are looking to release the product more broadly in the UK in early 2024. During the period we also supported initial installation of the digital platform in one European country, and we look forward to introducing the App into more geographies during 2024 and beyond.\nAs we announced at the beginning of 2023, FoodPrint\u00ae was installed in our first laboratory in the USA and following approvals is now live and actively commercialising FoodPrint\u00ae. Further expansion into the USA is planned, with validation and approvals currently taking place with two other laboratories in the region.\nWe saw robust growth in our UK market, which is serviced by our own testing laboratory, CNSLab. Sales grew by 97%, driven by both practitioner-based business as well as direct consumer demand serviced by our white-label partners.\nOur menu expansion into Microbiome testing is progressing\nwith a UK based trial in conjunction with a test report provider which will allow us to assess the market feedback and requirements to further define the product offering in what is a fast-evolving area.\nDispute with the DHSC\nThere is no further progress to report in our dispute with the Department of Health and Social Care ('DHSC'). The Board continues to vigorously pursue its substantial counterclaim for losses incurred towards the DHSC, as a direct result of its failure to licence the necessary intellectual property to permit the contract to move forward and their failure to notify the Group of their inability to do so in a timely manner. The Board remains confident that the Company has a compelling case.\nCurrent Trading and Outlook\nWe are pleased with progress over the first half of the fiscal year as the Company builds a solid foundation from which it can continue to grow. H2 is expected to remain strong, although in the absence of any further backlog to fulfill, is expected to be slightly lower than H1 FY24 with the full year's revenue expected to be in line with market expectations. The investment for the final steps in the\nseparation of the business from the historical group will be completed during FY25. We\nwill continue with our plans of expanding into the USA market and adding value to the customer base with two other laboratories in the region working on the validation and approval of the FoodPrint test in readiness for launch in early FY25. The MyHealth Tracker roll out in the UK will be finalised in Q4 FY24 and a further phased roll out is planned for FY25.\nThe Board's expectations are that the market conditions remain good and that we are well capitalised and in a strong position to grow as a standalone business.\nSimon Douglas\nNon-Executive Chair\nConsolidated Statement of\u00a0Comprehensive Income\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2023\nAs restated*\n6 months ended.\n30 September 2023\n6 months ended.\n30 September 2022\n12 months ended.\n31 March 2023\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContinuing operations\nRevenue\n3\n4,934\n3,434\n7,546\nCost of sales\n(1,841)\n(1,581)\n(4,001)\nGross profit\n3,093\n1,853\n3,545\nAdministration costs\n(2,746)\n(1,959)\n(4,755)\nSelling and marketing costs\n(790)\n(730)\n(1,530)\nOther income\n51\n-\n25\nOperating loss before exceptional items\n(392)\n(836)\n(2,715)\nExceptional items\n(294)\n-\n(524)\nOperating loss after exceptional items\n(686)\n(836)\n(3,239)\nFinance costs\n4\n(12)\n(6)\n(13)\nLoss before taxation\n(698)\n(842)\n(3,252)\nTax credit\n5\n-\n-\n80\nLoss for the period from continuing operations\n(698)\n(842)\n(3,172)\nDiscontinued operations\nLoss after tax for the period from discontinued operations\n6\n-\n(1,245)\n(688)\nLoss for the period\n(698)\n(2,087)\n(3,860)\nOther comprehensive (losses)/income to be reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods\nExchange differences on translation of foreign operations\n(3)\n22\n(15)\nOther comprehensive income for the period\n(3)\n22\n(15)\nTotal comprehensive lossesfor the period\n(701)\n(2,065)\n(3,875)\nEarnings per share (EPS)\nBasic and diluted EPS on loss for the period\n7\n(0.3)p\n(0.9)p\n(1.7)p\nEarnings per share for continuing operations\nBasic and diluted EPS on loss for the period from continuing operations\n7\n(0.3)p\n(0.4)p\n(1.4)p\n* See note 2 for details regarding the restatement.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nas at 30 September 2023\n30 September 2023\n30 September 2022\n31 March 2023\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nASSETS\nNon-current assets\nIntangibles\n8\n4,313\n4,556\n4,525\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n9\n515\n1,062\n567\nRight of use assets\n9\n177\n62\n21\nDeferred taxation\n994\n1,120\n997\nTotal non-current assets\n5,999\n6,800\n6,110\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n1,073\n1,074\n777\nTrade and other receivables\n2,290\n6,544\n2,403\nCash and cash equivalents\n4,396\n2,712\n5,115\nTotal current assets\n7,759\n10,330\n8,295\nAssets held for sale\n-\n-\n-\nTotal assets\n13,758\n17,130\n14,405\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nEquity\nShare capital\n10,244\n10,244\n10,244\nShare premium\n25,072\n25,100\n25,072\nRetained deficit\n(25,974)\n(23,534)\n(25,319)\nTranslation reserve\n(49)\n(8)\n(46)\nTotal equity\n9,293\n11,802\n9,951\nLiabilities\nNon-current liabilities\nLong-term borrowings\n3\n35\n19\nLease liabilities\n77\n-\n-\nDeferred income\n2,500\n2,500\n2,500\nTotal non-current liabilities\n2,580\n2,535\n2,519\nCurrent liabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n33\n31\n32\nLease liabilities\n101\n69\n23\nTrade and other payables\n1,452\n2,282\n1,525\nTotal current liabilities\n1,586\n2,382\n1,580\nLiabilities directly associated with assets held for sale\n299\n411\n355\nTotal liabilities\n4,465\n5,328\n4,454\nTotal equity and liabilities\n13,758\n17,130\n14,405\n* See note 2 for details regarding the restatement.\nConsolidated Statement of\u00a0Changes in Equity\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2023\nShare\nShare\nRetained\nTranslation\ncapital\npremium\ndeficit\nreserve\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nBalance at 31 March 2022\n8,044\n25,340\n(21,537)\n(31)\n11,816\nLoss for the period to 30 September 2022\n-\n-\n(2,087)\n-\n(2,087)\nOther comprehensive losses -

BASIS OF PREPARATION\nFor the purpose of preparing the 31 March 2023 annual financial statements the Directors used IFRS as adopted by the EU and in accordance with the AIM Rules issued by the London Stock Exchange. In preparing these interim financial statements, the accounting policies used in the Group's Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been applied consistently. The Group has not applied IAS 34\nInterim Financial Reporting\n, which is not mandatory for AIM companies, in the preparation of these interim financial statements.\nThe interim financial statements are unaudited. The information shown in the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2023 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006 and the information in respect of the year ended 31 March 2023 has been extracted from the Group's 2023 Annual Report which has been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on the financial statements contained within the Group's 2023 Annual Report was unqualified and did not contain a statement under sections 498 (2) and 498 (3) of Chapter 3, Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. These interim financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 22 November 2023.\n2. RESTATEMENT OF COMPARATIVES\nGroup\nDiscontinued operations\nFollowing a review of administration costs, \u00a3186,000 of credits applicable to discontinued operations have been identified as being incorrectly applied to continuing operations as reported in the interim results reported for the six months ended 31 September 2022. This does not affect the results reported in the annual report for the year to 31 March 2023.\nThe effect of the restatements noted above on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as at 30 September 2022 is as follows:\nAs reported\nRestatement\nAs restated\n30 September 2022\n30 September 2022\n30 September 2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContinuing operations\nRevenue\n3,434\n-\n3,434\nCost of sales\n(1,581)\n-\n(1,581)\nGross profit\n1,853\n-\n1,853\nAdministration costs\n(1,773)\n(186)\n(1,959)\nSelling and marketing costs\n(730)\n-\n(730)\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\nOperating loss before exceptional items\n(650)\n(186)\n(836)\nExceptional items\n-\n-\n-\nOperating loss after exceptional items\n(650)\n(186)\n(836)\nFinance costs\n(6)\n-\n(6)\nLoss before taxation\n(656)\n(186)\n(842)\nTax credit/(expense)\n-\n-\n-\nLoss for the period from continuing operations\n(656)\n(186)\n(842)\nDiscontinued operations\nLoss after tax for the period from discontinued operations\n(1,431)\n186\n(1,245)\nLoss for the period\n(2,087)\n-\n(2,087)\nOther comprehensive income to be reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods\nExchange differences on translation of foreign operations\n22\n-\n22\nOther comprehensive income for the period\n22\n-\n22\nTotal comprehensive losses for the period\n(2,065)\n-\n(2,065)\nEarnings per share (EPS)\nBasic and diluted EPS on loss for the period\n(0.3)p\n-\n(0.3)p\nEarnings per share for continuing operations\nBasic and diluted EPS on loss for the period from continuing operations\n(0.3)p\n(0.1)p\n(0.4)p\n3.
