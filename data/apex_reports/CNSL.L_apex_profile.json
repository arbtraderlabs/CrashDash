Upon the publication of this announcement via Regulatory Information Service (\"RIS\"), this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nAbout Cambridge Nutritional Sciences plc\nCambridge Nutritional Sciences plc (AIM: CNSL) is a specialist medical diagnostics company focused on industry-leading Health and Nutrition products.\nJames Cooper, Chief Executive Statement\nOverview\nSales in the first half of this fiscal year have not reached our expectations. The key regions we have seen sales fall against last year are in mainland Europe, Africa/Middle East and the Americas. We have experienced existing customers ordering lower volumes and new clients taking longer to place significant orders. This demonstrates the need to increase our pipeline further and focus on driving demand in these regions, as the feedback on our product and its appeal to customers remains positive. We are continuing to review our position amongst our competitors to ensure we are considered a top choice for Food IgG testing. The positive news on the sales side is that the UK and India continue to show good growth, both markets where we have more control of the laboratories and the sales teams. This growth demonstrates to us the substantial opportunity that exists in the other regions.\nFinancial Performance\nRevenue decreased 6.6% to \u00a33.9m (H1 2025: \u00a34.1m) which was below our expectations and driven by a slowness in orders in many of our key regions. We have seen year on year sales growth of 33% in India and 6% in the UK, with all other regions showing decreases. The biggest fall is in Europe with some distributors in France, Poland and Hungary ordering less in H1 than in previous years. The European market is one of the most competitive and we are exploring all options to ensure we continue to focus our sales coverage to the most appropriate regions.\nRevenue by product group:\n\u00a7\nSales of FoodPrint\u00ae decreased 7% to \u00a32.4m (H1 2025: \u00a32.6m)\n\u00a7\nSales of Food Detective\u00ae decreased 23% to \u00a30.6m (H1 2025: \u00a30.7m)\n\u00a7\nCNS Lab and other sales were up 9% to \u00a30.9m (H1 2025: \u00a30.9m)\nGross profit from operations decreased to \u00a32.6m (H1 2025: \u00a32.7m) with an improved gross margin percentage of 67.7% (H1 2025: 65.4%). The increase in margin principally reflects the continued improvements in production yields as well as a higher proportion of high margin FoodPrint\u00ae tests in the product mix. Despite the competition and pressure to reduce price, the Board is confident that Food Print\u00ae margins can continue at this improved level in H2 FY25 as the Company benefits from the enhanced operational efficiencies.\nOverheads increased by 4% to \u00a32.6m (H1 2025: \u00a32.5m). This increase is directly attributed to an increase in investment in our sales, marketing and leadership team from H2 FY25 showing full year effect in H1 FY26. We do anticipate some of these costs will increase in the second half as the restructuring work referred to below in more detail will most likely incur some additional costs.\nThe Group continues to consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for exceptional items and share-based payments) as being the appropriate measures of profitability being aligned with the cash generating activities of the business. The adjusted EBITDA was \u00a30.1m (H1 2025: \u00a30.2m). The \u00a30.1m for exceptional items is related to compensation for loss of office and share related payments.\nThe cash balance on 30 September 2025 was \u00a33.6m (H1 2025: \u00a34.5m, 31 March 2025: \u00a34.9m) and fell from the March 2025 year-end position as a result of outflows from working capital (\u00a30.7m), capital expenditure predominantly in new machinery/systems (\u00a30.4m) and financing activities (\u00a30.1m). The capital expenditure includes the purchase of a new machine to manufacture FoodPrint as well as investment in our new LIMS system, work on our new website and IVDR project. In the previous financial year we experienced a similar reduction in cash from March year end to September half year.\nOperational Update\nThe historic work undertaken in creating efficiencies in producing our tests and servicing our test results in the laboratory in the UK, has resulted in excellent performance improvements in operations, and updates to sample collection packs, upgrading our Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)system and processes and related projects demonstrates the urgency with which this work continues. The 2.3% gross margin increase is a direct result of this work\n. We are very proud of our operations team based in Littleport and are confident they will deliver even more improvements for the remaining year.\nThe MyHealth Tracker App we have been operating has been used less frequently as customers have started to use their own Apps. This App has therefore been suspended for new customers whilst we explore what additional and new information our new LIMS system can produce for the benefit of all our customers.\nStrategic Priorities\nDriving more sales from existing and new customers is our number one priority.\nThe Board asked management to undertake a restructure of the existing Sales team to improve focus and attention on customers, and reduce the span of activities undertaken by our salespeople. The restructure has been completed and involved separating the customer service and customer success functions from the sales team so once a new or existing client signs a contract or places orders they can be serviced by these teams, with the sales team moving onto the next customer. These teams will help with new installations, overseas stock levels and ordering requirements as well as any other issues that may arise. They will work closely with distributors and laboratories to make using our test processes and systems a smooth and easy operation. The customer acquisition team, who are based in the regions, will help drive more demand for our products in the overseas regions directly into these laboratories. This restructure commenced recently and we will let you know in our next update at year end how it is working. At the moment the plans are to rearrange existing teams to complete this restructure with the additional headcount needed being one or two people at most.\nIn terms of regions of focus, the UK, Europe, Americas and Asia (especially India) remain our key markets. Progress in the Americas is much slower than we had hoped, but we remain confident this market will deliver good growth in the future. The laboratories we have signed are taking longer than planned to commence our tests, but we have some local support, as part of the customer acquisition team, to help drive more traffic into the laboratories for our tests. We recently changed this local support as the previous support was not delivering.\nWe saw robust growth in our UK market, with 6% growth in the first half on last year coming on top of the 8% growth reported last year. This growth is coming mainly from the direct consumer demand serviced by our white-label partners, and demonstrates the increasing awareness of how direct consumer marketing generates more demand for our tests in the UK. We believe this bodes well for overseas markets also. In India, the business has grown 33% in sterling value in the first half which translates to over 40% in local currency, demonstrating how well our tests are received in that markets where our local sales team are growing fast to drive even more growth. At over 10% of our overall sales, this market is one we are looking for even more sales growth.\nIn August we launched a new product called\u00a0Gut Detective\u00ae which is for our UK practitioner market only at the outset. Gut Detective is a comprehensive stool biomarker panel used by practitioners to investigate key areas of gut health, including inflammation, digestive enzyme production and intestinal permeability. This noninvasive testing solution helps identify underlying imbalances and supports targeted, personalised treatment plans. Gut Detective combines multiple functional stool markers into a single, convenient panel. It provides a detailed picture of a patient's digestive health, helping to uncover potential causes of persistent symptoms that may not show up on routine tests. Each test is CE-marked and analysed in the CNSLab, ensuring trusted clinical accuracy. It's an ideal tool for practitioners specialising in nutrition, gut health, functional medicine, or integrative care.\nCurrent trading and Outlook\nWe acknowledge sales in the first half have been disappointing as the Company builds its sales focus to operate a multi-channel multi-regional approach. We have seen the difficulties in some of our larger regions and are expecting a slow recovery in these areas, accordingly our full year revenues will show a modest decline compared to the prior year\n.\nHowever gross margin is expected to hold strong and with careful cost management we expect to remain profitable for the full year at the adjusted EBITDA level. That will require a lot of careful management of the team and costs to achieve, without taking our focus off the need to deliver more sales and orders.\nAs a result of the above, we anticipate the cash position will decline in H2, as further capital expenditure is expected as we continue to invest in the long term potential of the business. However, we believe we have more than sufficient working capital to execute on our strategy and return the Company to growth with a healthy gross margin.\nThe Board's expectations are that the medium term growth opportunities remain significant and the Company is well capitalised to deliver growth in the years ahead.\nConsolidated Statement of\u00a0Comprehensive Income\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n6 months ended.\n30 September 2025\n6 months ended.\n30 September 2024\n12 months ended.\n31 March 2025\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n2\n3,863\n4,134\n8,330\nCost of sales\n(1,248)\n(1,432)\n(2,889)\nGross profit\n2,615\n2,702\n5,441\nAdministration costs\n(2,169)\n(2,263)\n(4,680)\nSelling and marketing costs\n(839)\n(617)\n(1,436)\nOther income\n96\n26\n280\nOperating loss before exceptional items\n(297)\n(152)\n(395)\nExceptional items\n(138)\n(117)\n1,831\nOperating profit/(loss) after exceptional items\n(435)\n(269)\n1,436\nFinance income/(costs)\n3\n38\n73\n130\nProfit/(Loss) before taxation\n(397)\n(196)\n1,566\nTax credit\n4\n-\n-\n-\nProfit/(Loss) for the period\n(397)\n(196)\n1,566\nOther comprehensive profit/(losses) to be reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods\nExchange differences on translation of foreign operations\n(33)\n(17)\n(25)\nOther comprehensive income for the period\n(33)\n(17)\n(25)\nTotal comprehensive profit/(losses) for the period\n(430)\n(213)\n1,541\nEarnings per share (EPS)\nBasic and diluted EPS on profit/(loss) for the period\n5\n(0.2)p\n(0.1)p\n0.7p\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nas at 30 September 2025\n30 September 2025\n30 September 2024\n31 March 2025\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nASSETS\nNon-current assets\nIntangibles\n6\n3,805\n4,039\n3,821\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n7\n670\n485\n535\nRight of use assets\n7\n175\n76\n226\nDeferred taxation\n1,406\n1,400\n1,406\nTotal non-current assets\n6,056\n6,000\n5,988\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n729\n776\n829\nTrade and other receivables\n2,311\n2,208\n1,965\nCash and cash equivalents\n3,594\n4,520\n4,868\nTotal current assets\n6,634\n7,504\n7,662\nTotal assets\n12,690\n13,504\n13,650\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nEquity\nShare capital\n10,255\n10,255\n10,255\nShare premium\n25,072\n25,072\n25,072\nRetained deficit\n(24,154)\n(25,710)\n(23,833)\nTranslation reserve\n(118)\n(77)\n(85)\nTotal equity\n11,055\n9,540\n11,409\nLiabilities\nNon-current liabilities\nLong-term borrowings\n-\n-\n-\nLease liabilities\n75\n-\n126\nDeferred income\n-\n2,500\n-\nTotal non-current liabilities\n75\n2,500\n126\nCurrent liabilities\nShort-term borrowings\n62\n3\n123\nLease liabilities\n100\n76\n100\nTrade and other payables\n1,398\n1,203\n1,892\nTotal current liabilities\n1,560\n1,282\n2,115\nLiabilities directly associated with assets held for sale\n-\n182\n-\nTotal liabilities\n1,635\n3,964\n2,241\nTotal equity and liabilities\n12,690\n13,504\n13,650\nConsolidated Statement of\u00a0Changes in Equity\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nShare\nShare\nRetained\nTranslation\ncapital\npremium\ndeficit\nreserve\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nBalance at 31 March 2024\n10,255\n25,072\n(25,585)\n(60)\n9,682\nLoss for the period to 30 September 2024\n-\n-\n(196)\n-\n(196)\nOther comprehensive losses -
