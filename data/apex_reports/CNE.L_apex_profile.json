These bonuses are expected to be paid through the Company's receivables balance with EGPC.\n\u00b7\nA commitment to implement a predominantly drilling-based work program in the first five years amounting to ~$100m, WI share.\n\u00b7\nIn addition to costs incurred under the new integrated concession, the Company has the right to recover 70% of the carried forward cost pool balance transferred from the original concessions, plus 100% of any unrecovered costs transferred from the original concessions and amortised as per the relevant original concession agreement.\nRandy Neely, Chief Executive, Capricorn Energy PLC said:\n\"This agreement marks a key milestone in unlocking further value in our Egyptian Western Desert asset base. The three partners: EGPC, Cheiron and Capricorn have put in significant time and effort to construct a business case that allows all parties to benefit. With the improved terms and consolidation of the development leases, the joint venture partners will be able to justify increased investment to unlock significant contingent resources, leading to increased production and reserves for the benefit of all stakeholders. The development potential of these assets is fully capable of being funded by cashflows generated in Egypt.\nWith the successful outcome of this milestone in sight, we, along with our partners, will now begin the work to achieve a similar outcome for the\nAlam El Shawish West (AESW) joint venture.\nWe believe this agreement is a very important step in restoring Capricorn as a premier small-cap energy company. In addition to our achievements in Egypt, we continue to actively evaluate material opportunities in the UK North Sea. Combined, these initiatives will make Capricorn significantly more sustainable as a business and attractive as an energy investment.\"\nEnds\nEnquiries to\n:\nAnalysts / Investors\nNathan Piper, Commercial Director\nTel: 0131 475 3000\nMedia\nDiana Milford, Corporate Affairs\nTel: 0131 475 3000\nGeorgia Edmonds/ Violet Wilson / Fergus Young, Camarco\nTel: 0203 757 4980\nAbout Capricorn Energy PLC\nCapricorn is a cash flow-focused energy producer, with an attractive portfolio of onshore development and production assets in the Western Desert.\nFor more information, visit\nwww.capricornenergy.com\n.\n[1]\nCompared to the terms disclosed in the 03 May 2024 analyst presentation on our website\n[2]\nBased on $60-80/bbl Brent price range, WI liquids production\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
