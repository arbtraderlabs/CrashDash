For a more comprehensive summary of the Company's assets, the Company's website may be referred to.\nHighlights\n:\no\nRed Rock expects the most important near-term developments to be:\no\nGold production in Burkina Faso\no\nRelease of arbitration result in the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"\nDRC\"\n)\no\nFurther updates on New Ballarat Gold Corporation\nComment: Red Rock CEO Andrew Bell states: \"\nOur confidence in the gold price has meant that our strategy has been to secure and not to let go of good gold ground. We now have a diverse portfolio of gold interests with the potential - subject to all the usual caveats - to go into mined production. We have had to wait for the result of our arbitration in the DRC but are now told we are about to receive an invitation to a concluding meeting. We are also invited to the DRC for meetings with Governmental parties on another matter and have been approached by a European private sector party about partnership in their project in the DRC which at first glance looks highly prospective.\nOn the basis that we receive and repatriate the arbitration award, we do not exclude the possibility of looking at projects presented to us as a result of our enhanced profile in the DRC. Any such opportunities would have to undergo substantial due diligence before consideration. It is worth noting that in the event of a successful resolution in the DRC, which we anticipate, our position there will be a strong one and this appears to be gaining some recognition.\nWe have pursued a resolution through multiple channels, and it is only recently that a new and direct channel opened at the highest levels has given new impetus to this long-drawn out process, where decisions may have been taken in principle but they have not been carried through. A settlement will have several important effects, including a more rapid advance of activity on other fronts, where we have been held back by a lack of the expected capital, as well as dealing with accumulated liabilities\nWe continue to move towards gold production in Burkina Faso. The consultants with which we have been working have to pass through time-consuming regulatory hurdles in India in order to bring Indian staff to site, and so to bypass this uncertainty we have entered into an agreement with an experienced South African-Congolese mine management team operating mines in the DRC for a carefully costed 'quick start' operation which will then be replicated in Cote d'Ivoire and we hope will lead to first gold sales in both jurisdictions before the end of 2024.\nPositive developments are occurring elsewhere in our operations.\nWe will continue to update the market.\"\nPROJECT\n2024 UPDATE\nFormer Copper-Cobalt Joint Venture, DRC\nThe Company has been notified that it is about to receive an invitation to a final session of the arbitration leading to release of the award. Red Rock remains open to and is discussing the possibility of agreeing an earlier outcome direct with the other party by an Acte Transactionnel.\nAs of today there has been no recovery by Red Rock and there is no certainty that there will be until documents are executed and released. Also, Red Rock will seek further advice on remedies that may be available through further actions, including in other jurisdictions.\nOther DRC\nThe Company has received an invitation to go to the DRC for discussions with a Governmental agency advancing a major and potentially cash-generative project.\nThe Company has also received an offer of co-operation on significant projects from a non-Congolese party.\nAdvancing any such projects would require prior settlement of the matter under arbitration, payment and repatriation of any award, and technical and legal due diligence. That such offers and invitations are being extended might on one view however be considered an indication of the Company's local standing and expectations that it will exit from the arbitration process shortly.\nNew Ballarat Gold Corporation Plc\nGold: Victoria, Australia\n100% interest\nThe payment of \u00a3250,000 due under para 5(c) of the Heads of Terms as previously announced (\"\nTerms\n\") has not been made by Red Rock by 18 September 2024 as required, and therefore the provisions of para 6(b)(3) of the Terms apply, by which a 60 day cure period is allowed for the payment to be made, in default of which the vendor may reacquire its sold interest for $1 plus a Note for any cash consideration paid.\nA number of major shareholders have indicated their support for the increase in capital necessary to satisfy its purchase commitments under the Terms (should funds from a settlement or award in the DRC not be received in a timely manner) and subject to this, Red Rock's intention is to place equity sufficient to enable it to fulfil the payment within the cure period.\nThe Company has been engaging with brokers and listed companies in Australia to discuss possibilities for achieving a listing for the assets but has no binding commitments to report at this stage.\nFaso Minerals Ltd\nGold: Boromo and Banfora greenstone belts, SW Burkina Faso\nSubsidiary\nThe Company has signed a consultancy agreement with Greypoint International (\"\nGreypoint\n\"), a company incorporated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, represented by\nMichael Billings a\ncting as Project Director to provide project management services as required for the Company's alluvial gold projects in Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.\nGreypoint responsibilities will include\n:\n\u00b7\nPlanning and overseeing all stages of the alluvial gold mining process.\n\u00b7\nCoordination with local teams, subcontractors, and suppliers.\n\u00b7\nEnsuring compliance with local laws and regulations.\n\u00b7\nReporting regularly on the progress, budget, and safety performance of the Projects.\n\u00b7\nAdvising on operational improvements and risk mitigation strategies.\n\u00b7\nManaging project timelines, resources, and workforce allocation.\nIn an initial 16 day period, the Consultant will:\n\u00b7\nProcure equipment, negotiate with suppliers and manage logistics.\n\u00b7\nEngage the Burkina Faso Embassy through the South African Chamber of Commerce to facilitate the logistical movement of the equipment, and open diplomatic and economic communication channels in Burkina Faso.\n\u00b7\nEngage the South African Embassy and the British Consulate in Burkina Faso to create a presence and assist and facilitate the effective communication and functioning within the Burkina Faso mining space.\n\u00b7\nLiaise with Red Rock representatives on permitting and licence issues\nThe Consultant will then mobilise plant to site and start operations, including a continuous programme of geological sampling and testing, the production of dore bars, and export.\nThe consultant referred to in the announcement of 27th February 2024, whose brief report was announced on 29th April 2024, has been unable to provide equipment on site according to the original and revised timetables, and has continuing delays resulting principally from the length, cost and complexity of the bureaucratic procedures required for permitting the Indian workforce intended to operate the consultant's concentrators and equipment on site.\nTo bring the assets into immediate scaleable production and ensure activity sufficient to ensure retention of the licences the Company has engaged Greypoint who are specialised in operations of this type.\nThe possibility remains of a larger scale operation involving the original consultant at a later date, but in the short term the Company took the swift action necessary to ensure delivery of the key objectives.\nMikei Gold Project\nWestern Kenya\nGold: 723,000 oz Mineral Resource Estimate at 1.49 g/t (JORC 2012)\n100% economic interest\nRed Rock has engaged lawyers to ensure the integrity of the process of licence renewal, which continues.\nLacGold Minerals Ltd\nGold: greenstone belts in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nSubsidiary\nRed Rock has identified alluvial potential within its granted licences.\nGreypoint personnel are familiar with and have operated in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and after taking initial steps to set up the gold operation in Burkina Faso (see above) will follow the same course and timelines on the Company's licences in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nElephant Oil Corporation\nPlans for an early listing have been dropped, but RRR expects finance to be secured which would mean that EOC will be capitalised to build value from the next phases of onshore exploration and if successful exit opportunities may still be available.\nZimbabwe Lithium\nAlthough there are signs of improvement in the lithium market, it is too early to recommence operations and therefore no production is expected until otherwise advised\n.\nColombian Gold Royalty\nSoma Gold Corporation, the owner of the El Limon mine, has announced the intention to restart gold processing in this quarter.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 as it

In the DRC we anticipate the final arbitration meeting possibly this week, and progress with other discussions is as noted, with site visits planned within days. Not all the progress merits separate announcement, but we consider that we are in a solid and improving position.\nIn Australia, the limited sampling on private ground we have carried out in the Kilmore licence in the Melbourne Zone near Southern Cross' Sunday Creek gold-antimony discovery has not yet identified strong anomalism. However, south of Ballarat in the Bendigo Zone to the west of Kilmore, we have identified the possibility of a new gold discovery with potential for accessory antimony at our drilled prospect at O'Loughlin's. The anomalies identified, though minor at this stage, extend over an area comparable to the nearby Ballarat gold mine. ]. Given the location and land access, and only 20 km from the existing Ballarat gold mine plant, this is a significant development.\"\nBurkina Faso\n: Greypoint International is operating on time and on budget, following the \"Quick-start\" Project path projected in the Company's announcement of 7th October 2024 (where further detail may be found). Some 16 days of October were spent sourcing equipment for prospecting and small scale gold production on the Company's behalf. The first batch of equipment has been invoiced to and paid by the Company, including a Niton XL2 980 Plus analyser and stand for X-ray fluorescence measurement, as well as a furnace, concentrator, pump, generator, piping, parts and consumables, and is being organised to arrive locally by air together with the \"Quick-start\" Project Manager this week.\nFurther equipment and six month's spares and supplies is expected to be despatched to arrive mid- to late-January, allowing the operations to be stepped up.\nThe Company expects to meet the timing targets set out in the announcement of 7th October 2027.\nDRC\n: Red Rock spent two weeks In Kinshasa in the course of October working to conclude the pending arbitration and meeting with Governmental agencies to discuss a major and potentially cash-generative joint venture project. A framework agreement for co-operation on this latter was signed with our longstanding partner and representative Mr Patrick Tuseku Tshianu, the principal of Koto DRC SARL.\nNew Ballarat Gold Corporation\n(Australian gold assets):\nExtensive coincident antimony and arsenic soil anomalism is confirmed at O'Loughlin's gold project south of Ballarat in Australia\n.\nThe Company is pleased to report significant antimony and arsenic anomalism has been detected in soil and rock chip geochemistry at its advanced O'Loughlin's gold project, south of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. The anomaly is supported in both soil sampling and multielement of drill core as antimony generally three standard deviations above background (Figure 1). The highest response from Sb coincided with the drilling program from 2022\n.\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/0812L_1-2024-11-5.pdf\nFigure\n1\nAs and Sb anomaly at O'Loughlins\nThe strong association of gold with arsenic has been well understood from historical mining in the Ballarat region, however this recent discovery of anomalous antimony is new. The discovery opens the possibility that gold mineralisation identified at O'Loughlin may have a different genesis to the orogenic gold mined at Ballarat and Bendigo. The Red Rock technical team now considers the age of mineralisation to be similar to the deposit styles of Fosterville\n[1]\nor Sunday Creek\n[2]\nrather than the more traditional Ballarat- Bendigo style of the region.\nIn 2022, five shallow diamond core drill holes were completed by Red Rock under these workings. A mineralised structure was intersected with spur veins returning a maximum interval of\n0.4m @ 12.34g/t Au\ndespite significant core losses due to broken and rubbly ground\n[3]\n. Current geological interpretation expects the mineralised structure will enrich in gold and antimony at depth on intersecting hinge folds. (Figure 2)\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/0812L_2-2024-11-5.pdf\nFigure\n2\nCross section Interpretation of O'Loughlins\nFuture exploration will now be directed towards better defining the key structures of the area at surface, particularly the fold hinges including plunge and from this a more targeted drill programme will be recommended.\nAbout O'Loughlin's\nOriginally identified by CRA in 1980's as a significant exploration target, little follow up work has been undertaken prior to Red Rock's strategic licence acquisition\n[4]\n. Initial field mapping and soil sampling by Red Rock supported CRA's target potential and in 2022 the company drilled five shallow holes intersecting a mineralised structure. Further work was completed to better target the potential for enrichment given the significant size of the arsenic anomaly. With the strength of the antimony price in the market O'Loughlin's demonstrates a potential for both gold and antimony mineralisation once the structure is enriched.\nAbout Red Rock gold projects in Victoria\nIn addition to the recent exploration success at O'Loughlin's, Red Rock has two \"ready to drill\" brownfields exploration plays in Berringa\n[5]\nand Ajax\n[6]\n. These projects have a combined exploration target size of over 1mil ounces. Additionally, over 10 other projects in the tenement package are ready to advance to the next stage\n[7]\n.\nQUALIFIED PERSON STATEMENT\nThe technical information in this report is compiled by David Holden, BSc, MBA, MEM, who is a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists and a Consultant to Red Rock Australasia Pty Limited.
