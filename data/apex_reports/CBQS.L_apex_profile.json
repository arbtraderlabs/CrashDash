In 2018 Qatar's private sector grew by almost 6%, a clear indication that the right initiatives have been put in place to promote sustainable economic growth. This positive momentum is set to continue in 2019, with the IMF forecasting 4% growth for the non-oil sector.\n\"In December 2018 S&P Global Ratings revised Qatar's outlook to stable due to the country's prudent macroeconomic policies, which is an affirmation of the confidence global investors place on the country's economic prospects.\n\"Commercial Bank's position as a leading financial institution enables it to play a significant role in supporting Qatar's economic transformation agenda by participating in projects that will strengthen and diversify the national economy.\"\nFinancial Performance\nMr. Hussain Alfardan, Commercial Bank's Vice Chairman\n, added, \"In 2018 Commercial Bank started to see the results of its 5-year strategic plan come to fruition.

Our team's strong commitment and diligent execution of the Bank's 5-year strategic plan is designed to cement Commercial Bank's status as a leading financial institution in Qatar.\n\"The increase in net profit was driven by the reduction in loan provisioning compared to the previous year.

The slight reduction was a result of the weakness in the Turkish Lira\nas reflected in Alternatifbank's financial reports. Similarly, loans and advances were QAR 83.7 billion in 2018, down 6.1% compared to last year due to the depreciation of the Turkish Lira and a contraction in Government borrowing following Qatar's sovereign bond issuance in April 2018. Weakness in the Turkish Lira and efforts to dispose of high cost deposits resulted in customer deposits of QAR 71.3 billion.\n\"The Domestic Bank reported an increase of 4.0% in net interest income to QAR 2,102 million, despite a 4.4% decrease in loans and advances compared to last year, through a combination of asset pricing and strong focus on cost of funding. Customer deposits decreased by 7.7% to QAR 62.4 billion, which was the effect of a conscious decision to let go of expensive deposits bearing high interest rates.\n\"The Turkish economy and currency have gone through some volatility over the last year but we remain convinced of the long term potential of Turkey and are committed to our Turkish subsidiary. We are confident that we have the right management team and right strategy in place to proactively seek opportunities with the right risk profile for growth.

Our Turkish subsidiary, ABank, has been aligned more closely in its working with Commercial Bank and with the injection of new equity and a Tier 2 issuance raised in the first half of the year, we had the funds to pursue loans in the corporate mid-market. However loan growth was limited as we remained highly selective of opportunities. Most importantly, we brought operational costs down by 5% at ABank during the period.

The overall loan growth was impacted by the government repayments of temporary overdrafts, despite growth in private sector loans by 7.2%.\nThe Group's\ninvestment securities\nincreased by 16.1% to QAR 29.4 billion at 30 June 2022 compared with QAR 25.3 billion in the same period in 2021.\nThe Group's\ncustomer deposits\nincreased by 8.5% to QAR 89.3 billion at 30 June 2022, compared with QAR 82.3 billion in the same period in 2021. L\now cost deposits increased by 11.0% due to the various cash management initiatives and digital products that the Bank offers.\nMr. Joseph Abraham, Commercial Bank's Group Chief Executive Officer, commented\n, \"Commercial Bank reported a positive set of results for the six months ended 30 June 2022, maintaining the momentum from the first quarter, as we make good progress on our strategy.\n\"The Group reported consolidated net profit of QAR 1.4 billion for the period, up 7.9% compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by an improvement in net interest income and increased contributions from our associates.\n\"Group net interest income for the six months ending 30 June 2022 increased by 10.0% to QAR 2.0 billion compared to the same period last year. The growth was driven mainly by asset repricing due to rising interest rate environment, reflecting positively on the interest income which was up 10.7%. Additionally, net interest margin improved to 2.8% from 2.6%.\n\"Normalized total fees and other income witnessed a healthy growth of 18.0% to QAR 595.6 million compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by an increase in FX and trading income. Investment income declined by QAR 122.6 million due to the heightened volatility in global capital markets. Despite this, normalized total operating income increased 11.7%.\n\"On normalized basis, the Group's cost-to-income ratio improved to 22.6% from 25.3% during the same period last year on the back of operating income growth.\n\"Consequently, operating profit in the first six months of 2022 increased by 15.9% to QAR 2.0 billion compared to the same period last year.\n\"Net provisions are in line with the guidance provided on cost of risk as we continue our conservative provisioning approach.\n\"Group loans and advances were QAR 101.2 billion for the first six months of 2022, up 0.6% compared to the same period last year mainly driven by growth in private sector loans mainly in commercial and services sectors. The overall loan growth was impacted by the government repayments due to the strong fiscal position.\n\"Customer deposits increased to QAR 89.3 billion, up by 8.5% compared to the same period last year. Low-cost deposits grew by 11.0%, which contributed positively to our net interest margin.\n\"The Domestic Bank improved its normalized cost to income ratio to 20.0%, down from 21.1% during the same period last year as the bank continues to focus on driving efficiencies through technology.\n\"Our associates continue to deliver better performance. Net profit from associates increased to QAR 106.4 million, up by 68.2% compared to the same period last year.\n\"During the period, the Group applied hyperinflationary accounting to Alternatif Bank in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standards (IAS) 29, which resulted in a non-cash \"net monetary loss\" of QAR 69.2 million reported in the Group's income statement. This accounting adjustment was neutral on the Group's total equity.\n\"Alternatif Bank reported net profit of QAR 84.0 million for the first half of 2022 compared to a net loss of QAR 13.8 million last year, mainly driven by an improvement in FX and trading income. With the hyperinflation adjustment, the net contribution of Alternatif Bank was QAR 58.6 million.\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
