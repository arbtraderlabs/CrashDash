The trading performance reported in this statement is based on unaudited management accounts.\nThe Board is pleased to report good progress from its strategic initiatives, delivering high-quality growth and strong margin performance, supporting the Group's ability to reinvest in its strategy.\nDemand from new and existing customers remained solid, supported by the Group's focus on higher-value customers and a highly recurring revenue base, with growth in all regions in the core CXDP business which is reflected in an increase in forward-looking contracted ARR.\nH1 Financial Highlights\n\u00b7\nTrading in line with full-year market expectations1\n\u00b7\nForward-looking contracted ARR from the core CXDP business up 13% (6% on an organic2 basis) to \u00a375.4m (H1 2025: \u00a367.0m)\n\u00b7\nRecurring revenue from the core CXDP business recognised in H1 up 11% (4% on an organic2 basis) to \u00a337.3m, which now represents 84% of total revenues (H1 2025: 80%)\n\u00b7\nTotal Group revenue including the low-margin CPAAS business up 4% to \u00a344.2m (H1 2025: \u00a342.4m), on a normalised3 basis this is up 9% (3% on an organic2 normalised3 basis)\n\u00b7\nARPC4 (excluding Social Snowball) increased by 7% on a normalised3 basis to \u00a31,968 per month (H1 2025: \u00a31,830 normalised or \u00a31,916 reported)\n\u00b7\nCash at 31 December 2025 totalled \u00a336.1m (31 December 2024: \u00a345.7m), following the $20m consideration payment for Social Snowball\n\u00b7\nFX headwinds incurred on all metrics above which are disclosed on an actual currency basis, constant-currency growth rates are all approximately 1% higher than those highlighted above\nAs highlighted over the previous year, H1 2025 represented an unusually strong comparator period across both the core CXDP business and the low\u2011margin CPAAS business as a result of final contributions from an exited CPAAS contract and exceptional SMS volume tied to specific marketing campaigns in H1 2025. Underlying core CXDP revenue continues to grow well, driven by continued growth in all regions and execution of the Group's targeted M&A strategy.\nFollowing its acquisition in late June 2025, Social Snowball has performed well, and integration is progressing to plan. ARR is up approximately 30% on an annualised basis since acquisition, with an acceleration in growth rate expected as Go-To-Market investments take effect. Social Snowball ARPC per month has increased by 9% (18% annualised) from US$319 per month upon acquisition to US$348 per month in December. It adds influencer, affiliate and referral marketing capability and strengthens the Group's Shopify ecosystem presence, supporting the opportunity to expand ARPC through cross- and up-sell across the enlarged customer base.\nProduct innovation continues to reflect customer demand for sophisticated yet easy\u2011to-use platforms that unify data and personalisation across channels to deliver measurable ROI. In H1, the Group delivered enhancements across the product suite, including continued strengthening of WinstonAI, further momentum in WhatsApp adoption, and the launch of CreatorSearch within Social Snowball. The Group's loyalty product is now being tested in production environments by early adopters, with positive results being generated for customers, with wider release expected later this fiscal year. Looking ahead to H2 and beyond, the Group will focus its product innovation investment on strengthening data, AI and partner integration capabilities, alongside continued enhancements to \u2011 internal infrastructure and processes.\nThe Board remains confident in the Group's prospects and expects to deliver FY26 results in line with market expectations, supported by the Group's strong cash position, high-visibility recurring revenues and strong, growing product portfolio. Despite macro pressures including FX volatility, customer cost sensitivity, and market consolidation, which presents both opportunities and challenges, the Group remains well positioned to navigate these dynamics through a differentiated, ROI-driven offering. The Board continues to proactively appraise acquisition opportunities in line with its strict criteria.\nNotice of Half-Year Results\nThe Group expects to announce its results for the six months ended 31 December 2025 in early March.\nMilan Patel, CEO of Dotdigital, commented:\n\"We have made a solid start to FY26, despite the challenging macro environment and continue to see customers prioritising platforms that simplify their technology stack and make results easier to achieve and measure. That plays to Dotdigital's strengths: a highly recurring revenue model, a broad all-in-one CXDP proposition and a clear focus on helping marketers use data and personalisation to drive outcomes.\nWe are progressing with a balance of ambition and discipline, investing where we see the best returns. Alongside continued organic investment, we remain proactive in assessing complementary acquisition opportunities that enhance the platform and support long-term value creation. Social Snowball is a product of this approach, and we are delighted with its contribution. With a comprehensive product portfolio, strong revenue visibility, a strengthening pipeline and a healthy balance sheet, we are confident in the year ahead and the Group's continued success.\"\n1\nConsensus market expectations for the year to 30 June 2026 at the time of publication:\n\u00b7\nRevenue: \u00a391.9m\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA: \u00a329.1m\n\u00b7\nAdjusted profit before tax: \u00a320.0m\n2\nOrganic revenue excludes results attributable to Social Snowball, acquired June 2025.\n3\nNormalised for the non-renewal of the non-core low-margin CPAAS contract as announced on 26 June 2025 (full annual contract value \u00a34.4m)\n4\nAverage revenue per customer\nContacts\nDotdigital Group plc\n+44 (0)20 3953 3072\nMilan Patel, CEO\ninvestorrelations@dotdigital.com\nTom Mullan, CFO\nAlma Strategic Communications\n+44 (0)20 3405 0210\nHilary Buchanan\ndotdigital@almastrategic.com\nDavid Ison\nWill Merison\nCanaccord Genuity (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nElizabeth Halley-Stott\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams, Corporate Finance\nSunila de Silva, Equity Capital Markets\nSinger Capital Markets (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nShaun Dobson\nJen Boorer\nAbout Dotdigital\nDotdigital Group plc (AIM: DOTD) is a leading provider of cross-channel marketing automation technology to marketing professionals.

The trading performance reported in this statement is based on draft unaudited management accounts and refers to expected results on an actual currency basis unless otherwise stated.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nGroup revenue of \u00a383.9m1 (FY24: \u00a379.0m), up 6% on an actual currency basis and 7% on a constant currency basis\n\u00b7\n94% of Group revenue is recurring or repeating revenue, consistent with FY24; 80% is contracted recurring (FY24: 79%)\n\u00b7\nAverage revenue per customer (\"ARPC\") increased by 8% on a constant currency and normalised basis to \u00a31,923 per month (FY24: \u00a31,781 normalised1 or \u00a31,857 previously reported)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted PBT expected to register strong growth in line with market expectations2\n\u00b7\nCash balance of \u00a336.2m as at 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: \u00a345.7m), following $20m cash payment for the acquisition of Social Snowball and reflecting continued strong cash generation\n\u00b7\nIntention to pay an increased final dividend in line with market expectations\n\u00b7\nAcquisition of Social Snowball, significantly growing the Group's US footprint, strengthening Group's cross-channel marketing automation capabilities and granting access to the rapidly growing influencer marketing segment\nThe Board is pleased to confirm a robust revenue performance and double-digit profit growth for the year, including growth in all geographic regions.\nNotwithstanding persistent challenging market conditions, the Group continued to see healthy demand in line with market trends for data, personalisation and AI functionality. It secured larger customers and higher-value contracts within its core mid-market segment alongside growing adoption among larger enterprises seeking to consolidate their technology stacks. Revenue from international regions grew by strong double-digit percentages and now represents 33% of total revenue (FY24: 32%).\nThe Group made good progress against its organic product roadmap, with continued investment in AI, platform upgrades and enhancements to support new customer and cross-selling success. In April 2025, Whatsapp was fully launched as a communication channel and revenue is now being generated from its use. More than 30 customers are in production across all regions, with demand growing and a clear competitive differentiator driving adoption and retention.\nThe acquisition of Social Snowball on 25 June 2025 marked a key strategic milestone, adding a highly complementary asset to the Group's offering and extending its reach into the fast-growing influencer, affiliate and referral marketing segments. This follows the integration of personalisation functionality with the acquisition of Fresh Relevance during FY24, further supporting the Board's strategy of driving high-margin, high-quality recurring SaaS revenue growth through the continued development of the Group's leading all-in-one CXDP platform.\nSupported by a robust balance sheet, the Board continues to assess further strategic M&A and targeted investment aligned to its strategic priorities, including strengthening go-to-market leadership and reinforcing operational foundations to support the Group's long-term growth ambitions.\nMilan Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Dotdigital, commented:\n\"We are pleased to report on a year of further profitable growth whilst materially advancing our product proposition to support our ambition of scaling innovative, high margin CDXP solutions within fast growing markets. The impact of our product enhancement efforts to date, both organically and inorganically, can be seen in a robust new customer acquisition performance as well as the continued uptake of additional functionality across our existing base. This has been accelerated further with the addition of Social Snowball in the year, unlocking a significant new market opportunity.\n\"Whilst market conditions remain uncertain, we remain laser focussed on the growth opportunities and roadmap to executing on our strategy. We enter the new year with a strong pipeline, robust financial position, a growing partner network and a significantly expanded market opportunity, leaving the Board confident in the Group's continued success.\"\n1\nIncludes the negative \u00a30.7m FY25 impact from termination of non-core, low-margin contract (full annual contract value of \u00a34.4m)\n2\nFY25 market consensus at the time of publication is adjusted EBITDA of \u00a325.8m and adjusted profit before tax of \u00a318.3m\nFor further information please contact:\nDotdigital Group Plc\nMilan Patel, CEOTom Mullan, CFO\nTel: 020 3953 3072\ninvestorrelations@dotdigital.com\nAlma Strategic Communications\nHil",

UPON PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\n26 June 2025\nDotdigital Group plc\n(\"Dotdigital\"\u00a0or the \"Group\")\nAcquisition of Social Snowball and Trading Update\nInfluencer, affiliate and referral marketing platform strengthens Dotdigital's all-in-one offering\nDotdigital Group plc\n(AIM: DOTD), the leading SaaS provider\u00a0of an all-in-one customer experience and data platform (CXDP), is pleased to announce the acquisition of Social Snowball Holdings, Inc. (\"Social Snowball\"), a US-based influencer, affiliate and referral marketing platform for e-commerce brands (\"the Acquisition\").\nThe Company today also provides an update on current trading and outlook.\nAcquisition Highlights\n\u00b7\nAdds complementary capability to Dotdigital in the fast-growing influencer, affiliate and referral marketing segments.\n\u00b7\nSocial Snowball is available through Shopify with over 1,500 active subscription-based customers, including G Fuel, Blume and True Classic, strengthening Dotdigital's Shopify channel partner foothold.\n\u00b7\nExtends capability of Dotdigital's all-in-one CXDP platform, strengthening the Group's competitive positioning and increasing its total addressable market (\"TAM\").\n\u00b7\nProvides Dotdigital with an enhanced value proposition to enable Average Revenue Per Customer (\"ARPC\") expansion through cross-sell and up-sell opportunities.\n\u00b7\nExpected to be immediately earnings enhancing, with a complementary SaaS business model and an equivalent margin profile to the existing Group.\n\u00b7\nThe total consideration for the Acquisition is up to USD $35m, comprising an initial cash payment of USD $20m and an earnout, dependent on performance, of up to USD $15m.\nSocial Snowball and the Influencer, Affiliate and Referral Market\nBased in Miami, Florida, Social Snowball (\nwww.socialsnowball.io\n) is a platform that helps e-commerce businesses grow by turning prospects, customers, influencers and affiliates into brand advocates - people who promote products in exchange for commission or rewards. Advocates are each given a unique, trackable link or code to share with their audience. When someone makes a purchase using that link or code, the advocate earns a commission or other reward, creating a trusted, performance-based marketing channel for the brand.1\nSocial Snowball helps businesses increase revenues and expand their reach, build trust and drive measurable results, all without significant upfront marketing spend. Social Snowball automates the entire process, from onboarding through to tracking and payout from a single dashboard. A key competitive advantage of Social Snowball is it has been built from the ground up with analytics at its core, enabling brands to measure and track when influencer, affiliate and referral activity converts to revenue, allowing clear ROI visibility beyond just clicks and views. Social Snowball was founded in 2020 by Noah Tucker who will remain with Dotdigital and continue to lead Social Snowball from its base in the US.\nAs social media and e-commerce continue to dominate consumer behaviour, this channel is becoming an increasingly core part of the modern marketing mix, with over 63% of brands planning partnerships with influencers in 2025 and over 25% of companies allocating more than 40% of their marketing budgets to influencer marketing2.\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2024 (\"FY24\"), Social Snowball reported a 200% increase in revenue to USD $3m, with run rate revenues greater than USD $5m at the time of Acquisition. In FY24 the company reported a loss before tax of USD $0.4m and has grown to be cash flow positive during the first half of 2025. The company had net assets of USD $0.3m in April 2025 and has no debt upon Acquisition. All figures are unaudited.\nAcquisition Rationale\nThe Acquisition is expected to be immediately earnings enhancing, providing a highly complementary addition to the Group's CXDP platform. Social Snowball strengthens Dotdigital's cross-channel marketing automation capabilities and creates a unique value proposition as the first company to bring these capabilities together. It also expands the Group's reach into the fast-growing influencer, affiliate and referral market, with affiliate marketing software projected to grow to an estimated USD $5.77 billion by 2032, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2%3, driven by growth in the wider global influencer market and the shift toward performance-based marketing.\nThe combined offering is expected to create new high-margin, recurring revenue by opening up additional customer acquisition opportunities as well as through cross-selling of add-on, highly relevant functionality across the enlarged base, driving greater retention a",

During his time at Gresham, Tom played a key role in driving a SaaS business model evolution, revenue and EBITDA growth, international expansion and successful M&A activity, culminating in the company's transition to private ownership in 2024.\nHe has also held senior finance roles at several international software businesses, including Fadata Group, a private equity-backed insurance software provider, and Guidewire Software, where he led EMEA finance and operations during a period of rapid expansion and supported the business through its NYSE listing.\nTom began his career at EY, qualifying as an ACCA and working across the UK, US and Australia.\nMilan Patel, CEO of Dotdigital, commented:\n\"With a strong track record working across high-growth software companies and an excellent reputation as a PLC CFO, Tom is an ideal fit for Dotdigital. I am confident that his strategic insight, financial and operational acumen, and extensive experience in driving organic growth, leading international expansion, and executing M&A will be invaluable as we continue to pursue our long-term growth ambitions.

Its long-term growth potential is clear and the opportunity to help shape that journey was a major draw for me. Milan and the Board have a focused strategy, supported by a talented and ambitious team, and I've been impressed by the clarity of vision and drive across the business.

But if you use it as a wedding hire car you can have a second income whereby over the years instead that income could repay a substantial amount of the purchase price paid for the roller. And IMO, that's the case here. So yes, they paid the full Monty. It was no boot sale bargain. But consider what's been bought. Wait a minute let one of the analysts (from behind a paywall!) explain it: -------- \"DOTD Despite the full-looking price paid, I\u2019m going to give this deal two thumbs up. There are times when I have to do a lot of work to figure out the point of an acquisition. This is not one of those times: the companies already serve the same companies with products that are so complementary to each other that they have already been partly integrated. In a situation like this, it\u2019s harder to find a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to combine the two enterprises. They can now work together more efficiently for their existing customers and improve their service to target new ones. On the financial side of things, Dotdigital can afford it and still has a significant cash balance. I think I\u2019ll maintain a positive view on these shares as the valuation doesn\u2019t seem too excessive when you consider that it has net cash, a fine track record of profitability, and good quality metrics. So it\u2019s worth studying in greater detail. Today\u2019s acquisition will boost revenues by around 10% and should eventually help to boost profitability, too. That might take a few years but then patience is a virtue!\" ------------ Was going to post my own findings today but it would be an even longer post than this! However this is a recovering Profit Warning stock (My post in March this year) so 'the herd' is unlikely to arrive until spring next year. In the meantime any deeper floors look tempting. It is still in a downtrend which I guess won't cease until the end of October (IMO only) but may still be opportunities for a cheaper entry all the way to spring next year (maybe). So in short I expect a recovery from next spring onwards. Any cheap entry will be v tempting and I'll likely be back in after years out of this stock :)",

First off - Thanks for the appreciative reply petrencf; the error I\u2019m referring to is my getting the date incorrect since I last posted here, - it was March \u201822, not March this year. So the profit warning I was referring to below occurred in March \u201822, not March this year. Hence the recovery I was alluding to, for spring next year is out of date and therefore null and void (should there be an SP recovery next spring then just sheer luck it times with my previous post). Generally, I don\u2019t do prices (I\u2019m a trend-follower by nature) but that intra-day low dip into the 60p\u2019s yesterday (Friday) brought something I was checking up on, back into mind, that might now be revealed. And that is, I was checking DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) metric versus market guidance, the modern version of Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 metric, and I\u2019m seeing on screen fair value as - 61p! Couldn\u2019t believe a figure so low, especially as ALL the analysts are citing well over a \u00a31+ as a target price! It must be said, that the DCF metric is a secondary guideline tool and not to be taken literally. However, with 60\u2019s briefly showing it\u2019s face yesterday I thought if things do take a further turn for the worse, a small punt in that area should be a good longer term safety area to invest in. (However, as things are oversold at the moment wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the SP did the opposite and mossies back on to the north road for awhile). SP is still strongly bearish at the moment, so an interesting few days next week. What may put a stamp on near future SP direction, will be the full year results which will be published in a couple of weeks, circa Tuesday, 14th November. And as best folklore advice is to: never buy before an expected, imminent trading update, I can\u2019t see myself buying before that date.",

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

This underscores the ongoing discussion within the company about the best path forward for growth. The leadership appears committed to maintaining a solid market position while carefully evaluating opportunities for expansion. The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

The only thing that i can think is the sector is more discretionary and will be perceived as less attractive (influencer space) than regtech, security,  etc, even so it seems under value to me",

Whereas, for much of this year they were riding the crest of optimism given favourable financial comparables to the previous year - now any slight reduction in forecasts or margins, and they are being punished with sharp share price falls.  The steeper the climb, the harder the falls - we just have to accept this volatility as investors. If we can't deal with it, we should be in cash or bonds. I'm definitely hanging onto my DODT shares, a quality company in a growing sector should be a great long-term investment.",

Possibly the worst time ever, to issue a profit warning in the face of the Russia influence hanging over everything. A Profit Warning means the SP will be toxic for the next 12 months. But usually profit warning stocks recover in the 2nd year after the warning. Those with strong stomachs can top-up on the bottoms. But the word most usually applied to the SP in situations like this is \"unreliable\" for the next 12 months. It does not mean the stock is going to the wall! Not at all. I'll be watching during the next 12 months as no one will ever correctly call the bottom in that time, including myself. Best opportunity will be a year's time from now. It won't be a linear recovery. Then there's current international carry-on with markets to factor in but that's the same for all stocks. Check out this morning's trading update or click the news update button above for the precise sentence in the trading update that did the damage. If still unsure I might post further later tonight. Meanwhile I want to find out what started this rot from last summer. This is one of my long term watchlist so not holding any stock. Might return later but first what big event fked the SP up, from circa last summer that's only strengthened the bearish retrace from then until now?",

It took a while for the company to admit that margins had been slashed thanks to the surge in SMS demand and, now that ship, too, has gone out, leading to faltering revenues. With Stg20m on the balance sheet (20pc of the company's worth) a buy-back should be on the agenda - but only after management puts some of their own money on the table and buy some shares, to signal their faith in the company.

Along with anemic revenue growth, H2 of '22 will be hit with higher costs from new hires (higher wages) coupled with renewed marketing spend. The briefing did make clear DOTD was hit by a talent raid in the U.S. (private equity got the cheque book out), that share options for staff is on the agenda, with a question re share buy-backs batted away by lumped it in with the usual debate over competing uses of capital - vis funding growth/M&A and buy-backs. Anyway, any decision must await the hiring, and onboarding of the new CFO, which is at the very least several months away. Given the shares are trading at around 12x (annualised) earnings, DOTD is almost trading at cyclical value stock levels. But without the board and senior management going into the market, it is impossible to expect a rebound anytime soon.",

          "content": "Depends on your definition of 'looks expensive' :) A Rolls Royce saloon is expensive, yes? But if you use it as a wedding hire car you can have a second income whereby over the years instead that income could repay a substantial amount of the purchase price paid for the roller. And IMO, that's the case here. So yes, they paid the full Monty. It was no boot sale bargain. But consider what's been bought. Wait a minute let one of the analysts (from behind a paywall!) explain it: -------- \"DOTD Despite the full-looking price paid, I\u2019m going to give this deal two thumbs up. There are times when I have to do a lot of work to figure out the point of an acquisition. This is not one of those times: the companies already serve the same companies with products that are so complementary to each other that they have already been partly integrated. In a situation like this, it\u2019s harder to find a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to combine the two enterprises. They can now work together more efficiently for their existing customers and improve their service to target new ones. On the financial side of things, Dotdigital can afford it and still has a significant cash balance. I think I\u2019ll maintain a positive view on these shares as the valuation doesn\u2019t seem too excessive when you consider that it has net cash, a fine track record of profitability, and good quality metrics. So it\u2019s worth studying in greater detail. Today\u2019s acquisition will boost revenues by around 10% and should eventually help to boost profitability, too. That might take a few years but then patience is a virtue!\" ------------ Was going to post my own findings today but it would be an even longer post than this! However this is a recovering Profit Warning stock (My post in March this year) so 'the herd' is unlikely to arrive until spring next year. In the meantime any deeper floors look tempting. It is still in a downtrend which I guess won't cease until the end of October (IMO only) but may still be opportunities for a cheaper entry all the way to spring next year (maybe). So in short I expect a recovery from next spring onwards. Any cheap entry will be v tempting and I'll likely be back in after years out of this stock :)",

          "content": "Wanted to correct an error in my post below, so with the SP intradaying into the 60p\u2019s briefly on Friday, might as well do so now. First off - Thanks for the appreciative reply petrencf; the error I\u2019m referring to is my getting the date incorrect since I last posted here, - it was March \u201822, not March this year. So the profit warning I was referring to below occurred in March \u201822, not March this year. Hence the recovery I was alluding to, for spring next year is out of date and therefore null and void (should there be an SP recovery next spring then just sheer luck it times with my previous post). Generally, I don\u2019t do prices (I\u2019m a trend-follower by nature) but that intra-day low dip into the 60p\u2019s yesterday (Friday) brought something I was checking up on, back into mind, that might now be revealed. And that is, I was checking DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) metric versus market guidance, the modern version of Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 metric, and I\u2019m seeing on screen fair value as - 61p! Couldn\u2019t believe a figure so low, especially as ALL the analysts are citing well over a \u00a31+ as a target price! It must be said, that the DCF metric is a secondary guideline tool and not to be taken literally. However, with 60\u2019s briefly showing it\u2019s face yesterday I thought if things do take a further turn for the worse, a small punt in that area should be a good longer term safety area to invest in. (However, as things are oversold at the moment wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the SP did the opposite and mossies back on to the north road for awhile). SP is still strongly bearish at the moment, so an interesting few days next week. What may put a stamp on near future SP direction, will be the full year results which will be published in a couple of weeks, circa Tuesday, 14th November. And as best folklore advice is to: never buy before an expected, imminent trading update, I can\u2019t see myself buying before that date.",

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

This underscores the ongoing discussion within the company about the best path forward for growth. The leadership appears committed to maintaining a solid market position while carefully evaluating opportunities for expansion. The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

The only thing that i can think is the sector is more discretionary and will be perceived as less attractive (influencer space) than regtech, security,  etc, even so it seems under value to me",

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

While there were some differences in perspective between the outgoing CFO and the CEO, it was evident that the CFO was a strong advocate for increased investment in R&D and potential M&A opportunities. This underscores the ongoing discussion within the company about the best path forward for growth. The leadership appears committed to maintaining a solid market position while carefully evaluating opportunities for expansion. The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

Possibly the worst time ever, to issue a profit warning in the face of the Russia influence hanging over everything. A Profit Warning means the SP will be toxic for the next 12 months. But usually profit warning stocks recover in the 2nd year after the warning. Those with strong stomachs can top-up on the bottoms. But the word most usually applied to the SP in situations like this is \"unreliable\" for the next 12 months. It does not mean the stock is going to the wall! Not at all. I'll be watching during the next 12 months as no one will ever correctly call the bottom in that time, including myself. Best opportunity will be a year's time from now. It won't be a linear recovery. Then there's current international carry-on with markets to factor in but that's the same for all stocks. Check out this morning's trading update or click the news update button above for the precise sentence in the trading update that did the damage. If still unsure I might post further later tonight. Meanwhile I want to find out what started this rot from last summer. This is one of my long term watchlist so not holding any stock. Might return later but first what big event fked the SP up, from circa last summer that's only strengthened the bearish retrace from then until now?",

U.S. revenue growth is minimal, even with strong market dynamics. It took a while for the company to admit that margins had been slashed thanks to the surge in SMS demand and, now that ship, too, has gone out, leading to faltering revenues. With Stg20m on the balance sheet (20pc of the company's worth) a buy-back should be on the agenda - but only after management puts some of their own money on the table and buy some shares, to signal their faith in the company. If not, why should anyone else buy? A fleeing CFO is never a good sign.",

Along with anemic revenue growth, H2 of '22 will be hit with higher costs from new hires (higher wages) coupled with renewed marketing spend. The briefing did make clear DOTD was hit by a talent raid in the U.S. (private equity got the cheque book out), that share options for staff is on the agenda, with a question re share buy-backs batted away by lumped it in with the usual debate over competing uses of capital - vis funding growth/M&A and buy-backs. Anyway, any decision must await the hiring, and onboarding of the new CFO, which is at the very least several months away. Given the shares are trading at around 12x (annualised) earnings, DOTD is almost trading at cyclical value stock levels. But without the board and senior management going into the market, it is impossible to expect a rebound anytime soon.",

The only thing that i can think is the sector is more discretionary and will be perceived as less attractive (influencer space) than regtech, security,  etc, even so it seems under value to me",

The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

The trading performance reported in this statement is based on unaudited management accounts.\nThe Board is pleased to report good progress from its strategic initiatives, delivering high-quality growth and strong margin performance, supporting the Group's ability to reinvest in its strategy.\nDemand from new and existing customers remained solid, supported by the Group's focus on higher-value customers and a highly recurring revenue base, with growth in all regions in the core CXDP business which is reflected in an increase in forward-looking contracted ARR.\nH1 Financial Highlights\n\u00b7\nTrading in line with full-year market expectations1\n\u00b7\nForward-looking contracted ARR from the core CXDP business up 13% (6% on an organic2 basis) to \u00a375.4m (H1 2025: \u00a367.0m)\n\u00b7\nRecurring revenue from the core CXDP business recognised in H1 up 11% (4% on an organic2 basis) to \u00a337.3m, which now represents 84% of total revenues (H1 2025: 80%)\n\u00b7\nTotal Group revenue including the low-margin CPAAS business up 4% to \u00a344.2m (H1 2025: \u00a342.4m), on a normalised3 basis this is up 9% (3% on an organic2 normalised3 basis)\n\u00b7\nARPC4 (excluding Social Snowball) increased by 7% on a normalised3 basis to \u00a31,968 per month (H1 2025: \u00a31,830 normalised or \u00a31,916 reported)\n\u00b7\nCash at 31 December 2025 totalled \u00a336.1m (31 December 2024: \u00a345.7m), following the $20m consideration payment for Social Snowball\n\u00b7\nFX headwinds incurred on all metrics above which are disclosed on an actual currency basis, constant-currency growth rates are all approximately 1% higher than those highlighted above\nAs highlighted over the previous year, H1 2025 represented an unusually strong comparator period across both the core CXDP business and the low\u2011margin CPAAS business as a result of final contributions from an exited CPAAS contract and exceptional SMS volume tied to specific marketing campaigns in H1 2025. Underlying core CXDP revenue continues to grow well, driven by continued growth in all regions and execution of the Group's targeted M&A strategy.\nFollowing its acquisition in late June 2025, Social Snowball has performed well, and integration is progressing to plan. ARR is up approximately 30% on an annualised basis since acquisition, with an acceleration in growth rate expected as Go-To-Market investments take effect. Social Snowball ARPC per month has increased by 9% (18% annualised) from US$319 per month upon acquisition to US$348 per month in December. It adds influencer, affiliate and referral marketing capability and strengthens the Group's Shopify ecosystem presence, supporting the opportunity to expand ARPC through cross- and up-sell across the enlarged customer base.\nProduct innovation continues to reflect customer demand for sophisticated yet easy\u2011to-use platforms that unify data and personalisation across channels to deliver measurable ROI. In H1, the Group delivered enhancements across the product suite, including continued strengthening of WinstonAI, further momentum in WhatsApp adoption, and the launch of CreatorSearch within Social Snowball. The Group's loyalty product is now being tested in production environments by early adopters, with positive results being generated for customers, with wider release expected later this fiscal year. Looking ahead to H2 and beyond, the Group will focus its product innovation investment on strengthening data, AI and partner integration capabilities, alongside continued enhancements to \u2011 internal infrastructure and processes.\nThe Board remains confident in the Group's prospects and expects to deliver FY26 results in line with market expectations, supported by the Group's strong cash position, high-visibility recurring revenues and strong, growing product portfolio. Despite macro pressures including FX volatility, customer cost sensitivity, and market consolidation, which presents both opportunities and challenges, the Group remains well positioned to navigate these dynamics through a differentiated, ROI-driven offering. The Board continues to proactively appraise acquisition opportunities in line with its strict criteria.\nNotice of Half-Year Results\nThe Group expects to announce its results for the six months ended 31 December 2025 in early March.\nMilan Patel, CEO of Dotdigital, commented:\n\"We have made a solid start to FY26, despite the challenging macro environment and continue to see customers prioritising platforms that simplify their technology stack and make results easier to achieve and measure.

          "content": "Wanted to correct an error in my post below, so with the SP intradaying into the 60p\u2019s briefly on Friday, might as well do so now. First off - Thanks for the appreciative reply petrencf; the error I\u2019m referring to is my getting the date incorrect since I last posted here, - it was March \u201822, not March this year. So the profit warning I was referring to below occurred in March \u201822, not March this year. Hence the recovery I was alluding to, for spring next year is out of date and therefore null and void (should there be an SP recovery next spring then just sheer luck it times with my previous post). Generally, I don\u2019t do prices (I\u2019m a trend-follower by nature) but that intra-day low dip into the 60p\u2019s yesterday (Friday) brought something I was checking up on, back into mind, that might now be revealed. And that is, I was checking DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) metric versus market guidance, the modern version of Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 metric, and I\u2019m seeing on screen fair value as - 61p! Couldn\u2019t believe a figure so low, especially as ALL the analysts are citing well over a \u00a31+ as a target price! It must be said, that the DCF metric is a secondary guideline tool and not to be taken literally. However, with 60\u2019s briefly showing it\u2019s face yesterday I thought if things do take a further turn for the worse, a small punt in that area should be a good longer term safety area to invest in. (However, as things are oversold at the moment wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the SP did the opposite and mossies back on to the north road for awhile). SP is still strongly bearish at the moment, so an interesting few days next week. What may put a stamp on near future SP direction, will be the full year results which will be published in a couple of weeks, circa Tuesday, 14th November. And as best folklore advice is to: never buy before an expected, imminent trading update, I can\u2019t see myself buying before that date.",

          "content": "Depends on your definition of 'looks expensive' :) A Rolls Royce saloon is expensive, yes? But if you use it as a wedding hire car you can have a second income whereby over the years instead that income could repay a substantial amount of the purchase price paid for the roller. And IMO, that's the case here. So yes, they paid the full Monty. It was no boot sale bargain. But consider what's been bought. Wait a minute let one of the analysts (from behind a paywall!) explain it: -------- \"DOTD Despite the full-looking price paid, I\u2019m going to give this deal two thumbs up. There are times when I have to do a lot of work to figure out the point of an acquisition. This is not one of those times: the companies already serve the same companies with products that are so complementary to each other that they have already been partly integrated. In a situation like this, it\u2019s harder to find a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to combine the two enterprises. They can now work together more efficiently for their existing customers and improve their service to target new ones. On the financial side of things, Dotdigital can afford it and still has a significant cash balance. I think I\u2019ll maintain a positive view on these shares as the valuation doesn\u2019t seem too excessive when you consider that it has net cash, a fine track record of profitability, and good quality metrics. So it\u2019s worth studying in greater detail. Today\u2019s acquisition will boost revenues by around 10% and should eventually help to boost profitability, too. That might take a few years but then patience is a virtue!\" ------------ Was going to post my own findings today but it would be an even longer post than this! However this is a recovering Profit Warning stock (My post in March this year) so 'the herd' is unlikely to arrive until spring next year. In the meantime any deeper floors look tempting. It is still in a downtrend which I guess won't cease until the end of October (IMO only) but may still be opportunities for a cheaper entry all the way to spring next year (maybe). So in short I expect a recovery from next spring onwards. Any cheap entry will be v tempting and I'll likely be back in after years out of this stock :)",

The only thing that i can think is the sector is more discretionary and will be perceived as less attractive (influencer space) than regtech, security,  etc, even so it seems under value to me",

While there were some differences in perspective between the outgoing CFO and the CEO, it was evident that the CFO was a strong advocate for increased investment in R&D and potential M&A opportunities. This underscores the ongoing discussion within the company about the best path forward for growth. The leadership appears committed to maintaining a solid market position while carefully evaluating opportunities for expansion. The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

First off - Thanks for the appreciative reply petrencf; the error I\u2019m referring to is my getting the date incorrect since I last posted here, - it was March \u201822, not March this year. So the profit warning I was referring to below occurred in March \u201822, not March this year. Hence the recovery I was alluding to, for spring next year is out of date and therefore null and void (should there be an SP recovery next spring then just sheer luck it times with my previous post). Generally, I don\u2019t do prices (I\u2019m a trend-follower by nature) but that intra-day low dip into the 60p\u2019s yesterday (Friday) brought something I was checking up on, back into mind, that might now be revealed. And that is, I was checking DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) metric versus market guidance, the modern version of Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 metric, and I\u2019m seeing on screen fair value as - 61p! Couldn\u2019t believe a figure so low, especially as ALL the analysts are citing well over a \u00a31+ as a target price! It must be said, that the DCF metric is a secondary guideline tool and not to be taken literally. However, with 60\u2019s briefly showing it\u2019s face yesterday I thought if things do take a further turn for the worse, a small punt in that area should be a good longer term safety area to invest in. (However, as things are oversold at the moment wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the SP did the opposite and mossies back on to the north road for awhile). SP is still strongly bearish at the moment, so an interesting few days next week. What may put a stamp on near future SP direction, will be the full year results which will be published in a couple of weeks, circa Tuesday, 14th November. And as best folklore advice is to: never buy before an expected, imminent trading update, I can\u2019t see myself buying before that date.",

          "content": "Depends on your definition of 'looks expensive' :) A Rolls Royce saloon is expensive, yes? But if you use it as a wedding hire car you can have a second income whereby over the years instead that income could repay a substantial amount of the purchase price paid for the roller. And IMO, that's the case here. So yes, they paid the full Monty. It was no boot sale bargain. But consider what's been bought. Wait a minute let one of the analysts (from behind a paywall!) explain it: -------- \"DOTD Despite the full-looking price paid, I\u2019m going to give this deal two thumbs up. There are times when I have to do a lot of work to figure out the point of an acquisition. This is not one of those times: the companies already serve the same companies with products that are so complementary to each other that they have already been partly integrated. In a situation like this, it\u2019s harder to find a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to combine the two enterprises. They can now work together more efficiently for their existing customers and improve their service to target new ones. On the financial side of things, Dotdigital can afford it and still has a significant cash balance. I think I\u2019ll maintain a positive view on these shares as the valuation doesn\u2019t seem too excessive when you consider that it has net cash, a fine track record of profitability, and good quality metrics. So it\u2019s worth studying in greater detail. Today\u2019s acquisition will boost revenues by around 10% and should eventually help to boost profitability, too. That might take a few years but then patience is a virtue!\" ------------ Was going to post my own findings today but it would be an even longer post than this! However this is a recovering Profit Warning stock (My post in March this year) so 'the herd' is unlikely to arrive until spring next year. In the meantime any deeper floors look tempting. It is still in a downtrend which I guess won't cease until the end of October (IMO only) but may still be opportunities for a cheaper entry all the way to spring next year (maybe). So in short I expect a recovery from next spring onwards. Any cheap entry will be v tempting and I'll likely be back in after years out of this stock :)",

The only thing that i can think is the sector is more discretionary and will be perceived as less attractive (influencer space) than regtech, security,  etc, even so it seems under value to me",

This underscores the ongoing discussion within the company about the best path forward for growth. The leadership appears committed to maintaining a solid market position while carefully evaluating opportunities for expansion. The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

          "content": "Wanted to correct an error in my post below, so with the SP intradaying into the 60p\u2019s briefly on Friday, might as well do so now. First off - Thanks for the appreciative reply petrencf; the error I\u2019m referring to is my getting the date incorrect since I last posted here, - it was March \u201822, not March this year. So the profit warning I was referring to below occurred in March \u201822, not March this year. Hence the recovery I was alluding to, for spring next year is out of date and therefore null and void (should there be an SP recovery next spring then just sheer luck it times with my previous post). Generally, I don\u2019t do prices (I\u2019m a trend-follower by nature) but that intra-day low dip into the 60p\u2019s yesterday (Friday) brought something I was checking up on, back into mind, that might now be revealed. And that is, I was checking DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) metric versus market guidance, the modern version of Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 metric, and I\u2019m seeing on screen fair value as - 61p! Couldn\u2019t believe a figure so low, especially as ALL the analysts are citing well over a \u00a31+ as a target price! It must be said, that the DCF metric is a secondary guideline tool and not to be taken literally. However, with 60\u2019s briefly showing it\u2019s face yesterday I thought if things do take a further turn for the worse, a small punt in that area should be a good longer term safety area to invest in. (However, as things are oversold at the moment wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the SP did the opposite and mossies back on to the north road for awhile). SP is still strongly bearish at the moment, so an interesting few days next week. What may put a stamp on near future SP direction, will be the full year results which will be published in a couple of weeks, circa Tuesday, 14th November. And as best folklore advice is to: never buy before an expected, imminent trading update, I can\u2019t see myself buying before that date.",

          "content": "Depends on your definition of 'looks expensive' :) A Rolls Royce saloon is expensive, yes? But if you use it as a wedding hire car you can have a second income whereby over the years instead that income could repay a substantial amount of the purchase price paid for the roller. And IMO, that's the case here. So yes, they paid the full Monty. It was no boot sale bargain. But consider what's been bought. Wait a minute let one of the analysts (from behind a paywall!) explain it: -------- \"DOTD Despite the full-looking price paid, I\u2019m going to give this deal two thumbs up. There are times when I have to do a lot of work to figure out the point of an acquisition. This is not one of those times: the companies already serve the same companies with products that are so complementary to each other that they have already been partly integrated. In a situation like this, it\u2019s harder to find a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to combine the two enterprises. They can now work together more efficiently for their existing customers and improve their service to target new ones. On the financial side of things, Dotdigital can afford it and still has a significant cash balance. I think I\u2019ll maintain a positive view on these shares as the valuation doesn\u2019t seem too excessive when you consider that it has net cash, a fine track record of profitability, and good quality metrics. So it\u2019s worth studying in greater detail. Today\u2019s acquisition will boost revenues by around 10% and should eventually help to boost profitability, too. That might take a few years but then patience is a virtue!\" ------------ Was going to post my own findings today but it would be an even longer post than this! However this is a recovering Profit Warning stock (My post in March this year) so 'the herd' is unlikely to arrive until spring next year. In the meantime any deeper floors look tempting. It is still in a downtrend which I guess won't cease until the end of October (IMO only) but may still be opportunities for a cheaper entry all the way to spring next year (maybe). So in short I expect a recovery from next spring onwards. Any cheap entry will be v tempting and I'll likely be back in after years out of this stock :)",

The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate.

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

          "content": "Wanted to correct an error in my post below, so with the SP intradaying into the 60p\u2019s briefly on Friday, might as well do so now. First off - Thanks for the appreciative reply petrencf; the error I\u2019m referring to is my getting the date incorrect since I last posted here, - it was March \u201822, not March this year. So the profit warning I was referring to below occurred in March \u201822, not March this year. Hence the recovery I was alluding to, for spring next year is out of date and therefore null and void (should there be an SP recovery next spring then just sheer luck it times with my previous post). Generally, I don\u2019t do prices (I\u2019m a trend-follower by nature) but that intra-day low dip into the 60p\u2019s yesterday (Friday) brought something I was checking up on, back into mind, that might now be revealed. And that is, I was checking DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) metric versus market guidance, the modern version of Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 metric, and I\u2019m seeing on screen fair value as - 61p! Couldn\u2019t believe a figure so low, especially as ALL the analysts are citing well over a \u00a31+ as a target price! It must be said, that the DCF metric is a secondary guideline tool and not to be taken literally. However, with 60\u2019s briefly showing it\u2019s face yesterday I thought if things do take a further turn for the worse, a small punt in that area should be a good longer term safety area to invest in. (However, as things are oversold at the moment wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the SP did the opposite and mossies back on to the north road for awhile). SP is still strongly bearish at the moment, so an interesting few days next week. What may put a stamp on near future SP direction, will be the full year results which will be published in a couple of weeks, circa Tuesday, 14th November. And as best folklore advice is to: never buy before an expected, imminent trading update, I can\u2019t see myself buying before that date.",

But if you use it as a wedding hire car you can have a second income whereby over the years instead that income could repay a substantial amount of the purchase price paid for the roller. And IMO, that's the case here. So yes, they paid the full Monty. It was no boot sale bargain. But consider what's been bought. Wait a minute let one of the analysts (from behind a paywall!) explain it: -------- \"DOTD Despite the full-looking price paid, I\u2019m going to give this deal two thumbs up. There are times when I have to do a lot of work to figure out the point of an acquisition. This is not one of those times: the companies already serve the same companies with products that are so complementary to each other that they have already been partly integrated. In a situation like this, it\u2019s harder to find a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to combine the two enterprises. They can now work together more efficiently for their existing customers and improve their service to target new ones. On the financial side of things, Dotdigital can afford it and still has a significant cash balance. I think I\u2019ll maintain a positive view on these shares as the valuation doesn\u2019t seem too excessive when you consider that it has net cash, a fine track record of profitability, and good quality metrics. So it\u2019s worth studying in greater detail. Today\u2019s acquisition will boost revenues by around 10% and should eventually help to boost profitability, too. That might take a few years but then patience is a virtue!\" ------------ Was going to post my own findings today but it would be an even longer post than this! However this is a recovering Profit Warning stock (My post in March this year) so 'the herd' is unlikely to arrive until spring next year. In the meantime any deeper floors look tempting. It is still in a downtrend which I guess won't cease until the end of October (IMO only) but may still be opportunities for a cheaper entry all the way to spring next year (maybe). So in short I expect a recovery from next spring onwards. Any cheap entry will be v tempting and I'll likely be back in after years out of this stock :)",

The only thing that i can think is the sector is more discretionary and will be perceived as less attractive (influencer space) than regtech, security,  etc, even so it seems under value to me",

While there were some differences in perspective between the outgoing CFO and the CEO, it was evident that the CFO was a strong advocate for increased investment in R&D and potential M&A opportunities. This underscores the ongoing discussion within the company about the best path forward for growth. The leadership appears committed to maintaining a solid market position while carefully evaluating opportunities for expansion. The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

          "content": "The investor presentation wasn't the best. There was clearly some underlying frustration / tension between the outgoing CFO and the CEO. The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",

          "content": "Wanted to correct an error in my post below, so with the SP intradaying into the 60p\u2019s briefly on Friday, might as well do so now. First off - Thanks for the appreciative reply petrencf; the error I\u2019m referring to is my getting the date incorrect since I last posted here, - it was March \u201822, not March this year. So the profit warning I was referring to below occurred in March \u201822, not March this year. Hence the recovery I was alluding to, for spring next year is out of date and therefore null and void (should there be an SP recovery next spring then just sheer luck it times with my previous post). Generally, I don\u2019t do prices (I\u2019m a trend-follower by nature) but that intra-day low dip into the 60p\u2019s yesterday (Friday) brought something I was checking up on, back into mind, that might now be revealed. And that is, I was checking DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) metric versus market guidance, the modern version of Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Margin of Safety\u2019 metric, and I\u2019m seeing on screen fair value as - 61p! Couldn\u2019t believe a figure so low, especially as ALL the analysts are citing well over a \u00a31+ as a target price! It must be said, that the DCF metric is a secondary guideline tool and not to be taken literally. However, with 60\u2019s briefly showing it\u2019s face yesterday I thought if things do take a further turn for the worse, a small punt in that area should be a good longer term safety area to invest in. (However, as things are oversold at the moment wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the SP did the opposite and mossies back on to the north road for awhile). SP is still strongly bearish at the moment, so an interesting few days next week. What may put a stamp on near future SP direction, will be the full year results which will be published in a couple of weeks, circa Tuesday, 14th November. And as best folklore advice is to: never buy before an expected, imminent trading update, I can\u2019t see myself buying before that date.",

          "content": "Depends on your definition of 'looks expensive' :) A Rolls Royce saloon is expensive, yes? But if you use it as a wedding hire car you can have a second income whereby over the years instead that income could repay a substantial amount of the purchase price paid for the roller. And IMO, that's the case here. So yes, they paid the full Monty. It was no boot sale bargain. But consider what's been bought. Wait a minute let one of the analysts (from behind a paywall!) explain it: -------- \"DOTD Despite the full-looking price paid, I\u2019m going to give this deal two thumbs up. There are times when I have to do a lot of work to figure out the point of an acquisition. This is not one of those times: the companies already serve the same companies with products that are so complementary to each other that they have already been partly integrated. In a situation like this, it\u2019s harder to find a reason\u00a0not\u00a0to combine the two enterprises. They can now work together more efficiently for their existing customers and improve their service to target new ones. On the financial side of things, Dotdigital can afford it and still has a significant cash balance. I think I\u2019ll maintain a positive view on these shares as the valuation doesn\u2019t seem too excessive when you consider that it has net cash, a fine track record of profitability, and good quality metrics. So it\u2019s worth studying in greater detail. Today\u2019s acquisition will boost revenues by around 10% and should eventually help to boost profitability, too. That might take a few years but then patience is a virtue!\" ------------ Was going to post my own findings today but it would be an even longer post than this! However this is a recovering Profit Warning stock (My post in March this year) so 'the herd' is unlikely to arrive until spring next year. In the meantime any deeper floors look tempting. It is still in a downtrend which I guess won't cease until the end of October (IMO only) but may still be opportunities for a cheaper entry all the way to spring next year (maybe). So in short I expect a recovery from next spring onwards. Any cheap entry will be v tempting and I'll likely be back in after years out of this stock :)",

The only thing that i can think is the sector is more discretionary and will be perceived as less attractive (influencer space) than regtech, security,  etc, even so it seems under value to me",

This underscores the ongoing discussion within the company about the best path forward for growth. The leadership appears committed to maintaining a solid market position while carefully evaluating opportunities for expansion. The CEO\u2019s risk-conscious strategy ensures financial health, with no debt and steady profits, which many investors may appreciate. While some may have hoped for more ambitious forward-looking plans, the company\u2019s disciplined approach could appeal to those who prioritise long-term stability over aggressive expansion.",

The CEO didnt even have the decency to thank him for his service on the call for example. There also did not seem to be any clear strategy put in place for how DOTD envisaged the future. They seemed more than content to occupy the market space that they currently reside in. This may be perceived as lacking ambition or direction. This was hinted at, for me at least, by the CFO who was clearly advocating that the purse strings be opened to allow more R&D which in turn would potentially open up more growth. This may also have extended to M&As where you could could detect a real unwillingness on the CEO's part to not acquire at what he consideed to be inflated valuations. My take was that the CEO came out of the call a little bit too controlling, and lacking direction. He is happy to tick along with decent profits, no debts etc which is all very admirable. But he also presented as extremely risk averse and shareholders looking for signs of ambition from this call would possibltly have had their hopes dashed and decided to look elsewhere.",
