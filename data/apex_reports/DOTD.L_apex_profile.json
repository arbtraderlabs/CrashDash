The trading performance reported in this statement is based on unaudited management accounts.\nThe Board is pleased to report good progress from its strategic initiatives, delivering high-quality growth and strong margin performance, supporting the Group's ability to reinvest in its strategy.\nDemand from new and existing customers remained solid, supported by the Group's focus on higher-value customers and a highly recurring revenue base, with growth in all regions in the core CXDP business which is reflected in an increase in forward-looking contracted ARR.\nH1 Financial Highlights\n\u00b7\nTrading in line with full-year market expectations1\n\u00b7\nForward-looking contracted ARR from the core CXDP business up 13% (6% on an organic2 basis) to \u00a375.4m (H1 2025: \u00a367.0m)\n\u00b7\nRecurring revenue from the core CXDP business recognised in H1 up 11% (4% on an organic2 basis) to \u00a337.3m, which now represents 84% of total revenues (H1 2025: 80%)\n\u00b7\nTotal Group revenue including the low-margin CPAAS business up 4% to \u00a344.2m (H1 2025: \u00a342.4m), on a normalised3 basis this is up 9% (3% on an organic2 normalised3 basis)\n\u00b7\nARPC4 (excluding Social Snowball) increased by 7% on a normalised3 basis to \u00a31,968 per month (H1 2025: \u00a31,830 normalised or \u00a31,916 reported)\n\u00b7\nCash at 31 December 2025 totalled \u00a336.1m (31 December 2024: \u00a345.7m), following the $20m consideration payment for Social Snowball\n\u00b7\nFX headwinds incurred on all metrics above which are disclosed on an actual currency basis, constant-currency growth rates are all approximately 1% higher than those highlighted above\nAs highlighted over the previous year, H1 2025 represented an unusually strong comparator period across both the core CXDP business and the low\u2011margin CPAAS business as a result of final contributions from an exited CPAAS contract and exceptional SMS volume tied to specific marketing campaigns in H1 2025. Underlying core CXDP revenue continues to grow well, driven by continued growth in all regions and execution of the Group's targeted M&A strategy.\nFollowing its acquisition in late June 2025, Social Snowball has performed well, and integration is progressing to plan. ARR is up approximately 30% on an annualised basis since acquisition, with an acceleration in growth rate expected as Go-To-Market investments take effect. Social Snowball ARPC per month has increased by 9% (18% annualised) from US$319 per month upon acquisition to US$348 per month in December. It adds influencer, affiliate and referral marketing capability and strengthens the Group's Shopify ecosystem presence, supporting the opportunity to expand ARPC through cross- and up-sell across the enlarged customer base.\nProduct innovation continues to reflect customer demand for sophisticated yet easy\u2011to-use platforms that unify data and personalisation across channels to deliver measurable ROI. In H1, the Group delivered enhancements across the product suite, including continued strengthening of WinstonAI, further momentum in WhatsApp adoption, and the launch of CreatorSearch within Social Snowball. The Group's loyalty product is now being tested in production environments by early adopters, with positive results being generated for customers, with wider release expected later this fiscal year. Looking ahead to H2 and beyond, the Group will focus its product innovation investment on strengthening data, AI and partner integration capabilities, alongside continued enhancements to \u2011 internal infrastructure and processes.\nThe Board remains confident in the Group's prospects and expects to deliver FY26 results in line with market expectations, supported by the Group's strong cash position, high-visibility recurring revenues and strong, growing product portfolio. Despite macro pressures including FX volatility, customer cost sensitivity, and market consolidation, which presents both opportunities and challenges, the Group remains well positioned to navigate these dynamics through a differentiated, ROI-driven offering. The Board continues to proactively appraise acquisition opportunities in line with its strict criteria.\nNotice of Half-Year Results\nThe Group expects to announce its results for the six months ended 31 December 2025 in early March.\nMilan Patel, CEO of Dotdigital, commented:\n\"We have made a solid start to FY26, despite the challenging macro environment and continue to see customers prioritising platforms that simplify their technology stack and make results easier to achieve and measure. That plays to Dotdigital's strengths: a highly recurring revenue model, a broad all-in-one CXDP proposition and a clear focus on helping marketers use data and personalisation to drive outcomes.\nWe are progressing with a balance of ambition and discipline, investing where we see the best returns. Alongside continued organic investment, we remain proactive in assessing complementary acquisition opportunities that enhance the platform and support long-term value creation. Social Snowball is a product of this approach, and we are delighted with its contribution. With a comprehensive product portfolio, strong revenue visibility, a strengthening pipeline and a healthy balance sheet, we are confident in the year ahead and the Group's continued success.\"\n1\nConsensus market expectations for the year to 30 June 2026 at the time of publication:\n\u00b7\nRevenue: \u00a391.9m\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA: \u00a329.1m\n\u00b7\nAdjusted profit before tax: \u00a320.0m\n2\nOrganic revenue excludes results attributable to Social Snowball, acquired June 2025.\n3\nNormalised for the non-renewal of the non-core low-margin CPAAS contract as announced on 26 June 2025 (full annual contract value \u00a34.4m)\n4\nAverage revenue per customer\nContacts\nDotdigital Group plc\n+44 (0)20 3953 3072\nMilan Patel, CEO\ninvestorrelations@dotdigital.com\nTom Mullan, CFO\nAlma Strategic Communications\n+44 (0)20 3405 0210\nHilary Buchanan\ndotdigital@almastrategic.com\nDavid Ison\nWill Merison\nCanaccord Genuity (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7523 8000\nBobbie Hilliam\nElizabeth Halley-Stott\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7220 0500\nJonny Franklin-Adams, Corporate Finance\nSunila de Silva, Equity Capital Markets\nSinger Capital Markets (Joint Broker)\n+44 (0)20 7496 3000\nShaun Dobson\nJen Boorer\nAbout Dotdigital\nDotdigital Group plc (AIM: DOTD) is a leading provider of cross-channel marketing automation technology to marketing professionals.
