He will provide strategic guidance on battery technology development, supporting Gelion's development of sulfur battery innovations.\nProfessor Yazami, widely recognised as a world leading battery technologist, is well-known for his pioneering work in establishing the reversible intercalation of lithium into graphite in an electrochemical cell, a breakthrough which led to the lithium-graphite anode which is now used in commercial lithium-ion batteries, a product with over $80 billion in market value\n[1]\n.\nProf. Yazami is highly awarded and recognized within global the battery science community. He is personally motivated by the potential of advanced energy storage technology and Gelion is honoured to have him recognise and share the same vision for sulfur battery technology to make a positive contribution to the energy transition and to join Gelion on its mission to unlock its full potential.\nGelion is developing its sulfur cathode material toward being a drop-in alternative for the existing standard Lithium-Ion Cathode material options used in LFP and NMC cells. As such, Gelion's goal encompasses pairing the Gelion Cathodes with the standard Graphitic anodes that use the intercalation methods that Prof. Yazami invented and pioneered.\nJohn Wood, CEO of Gelion, said:\n\"Sulfur battery chemistry has enormous potential to extend the capabilities of the energy storage industry. Gelion is moving quickly to explore new technological frontiers. Advanced battery technology requires expansive thinking by people who can visualize and conceptualize at a deeper level.\n\"Prof. Yazami is a powerful thinker who understands the fundamental mechanisms inside the cells in a comprehensive way. Being able to bring Prof. Yazami together with our founder Prof. Thomas Maschmeyer and advisor Prof. Markus Antonietti establishes an exciting nexus of brilliance available to Gelion both for what they can contribute directly and for the technology leadership, inspiration and experience they can bring to our talented science team.\n\"I am very grateful for Prof. Yazami's support for Gelion's important mission.\"\nProf. Rachid Yazami added:\n\"I am thrilled to join Gelion's team as an advisor on this exciting Li-S battery commercialisation project. The Li-S technology offers great improvement opportunities and is seen as a serious alternative to the lithium-ion battery in various domains of applications.\n\"Li-S batteries are cost-effective, high-energy density, safe and long-lasting. With the Gelion team under the guidance of John Wood, I will strive to make the commercialisation of the Li-S technology a successful reality.\"\nAbout Prof. Yazami\nProf. Yazami is very active today advancing battery effectiveness, capabilities, and safety.\nIn terms of battery effectiveness, Prof. Yazami has established a universal (empirical) law that applies to primary and rechargeable batteries, that is the state of charge is a linear function of entropy and enthalpy which makes it possible to better establish the state of charge of any cell. This breakthrough is being advanced within Prof. Yazami's independent startup KVI PTE LTD.\nIn terms of safety, Prof. Yazami has developed a new method based on entropymetry to detect an early stage of an internal short circuit within a battery cell, therefore making batteries safer.\nMost recently Prof. Yazami invented a new method enabling ultra-fast charging (UFC) lithium-ion batteries in 10 minutes and below, even while increasing battery capacity that uses breakthrough fundamental understanding that has recently been proven by testing with Caltech.\nCONTACTS\nGelion plc\nJohn Wood, CEOAmit Gupta, CFO\nvia Alma\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated and Financial Adviser)Christopher Raggett / Rob Patrick / Harry Marshall\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital\n(Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Mike Seabrook / Adam Pollock\n+44 (0) 20 3179 5300\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nJos Pinnington / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nAlma Strategic Communications\n(Financial PR)Justine James / Hannah Campbell / Rose Docherty\n+44 (0) 20 3405 0205\ngelion@almastrategic.com\nAbout Gelion\nGelion (\"gel: ion\") is a global energy storage innovator, supporting the transition to a more sustainable economy by commercialising globally important next generation battery technologies: Sulfur based, Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S), Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) and Zinc-based (Zn) hybrid cells to electrify mobile and stationary applications.
