Gelion's NES\u2122 is made from sulfur which is abundantly available, free from supply chain constraints.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nGelion's NES\u2122 Cathode Active Material (CAM) samples have been supplied to TDK Corporation (\"TDK\") in Japan.\n\u00b7\nInitial pouch cells incorporating Gelion's NES\u2122 CAM have been successfully manufactured by TDK with early test results meeting the Company's expectations.\n\u00b7\nGelion also provided its GEN3 CAM to QinetiQ which has produced initial pouch cells. Gelion is now equipping Gelion Europe to provide NES\u2122 CAM to QinetiQ so that QinetiQ can produce NES\u2122 CAM Pouch cells.\n\u00b7\nActive discussions are progressing with multiple global partners across a range of applications and geographies.\n\u00b7\nAdditional funding from ARENA to accelerate CAM commercialisation and scale-up.\nCommercialisation partnerships\nFurther to the strategic objectives outlined in November 2025, Gelion confirms that samples of its proprietary sulfur CAM formulations have been delivered to both TDK in Japan and to QinetiQ in the UK. This is an important step in executing the Company's partnership-led commercialisation strategy and demonstrates the Company's ability to produce material at volumes consistent with pouch cell demonstration requirements.\nEarly pouch cell manufacturing\nInitial pouch cells incorporating Gelion's sulfur NES\u2122 CAM have been successfully manufactured by TDK as part of the ongoing collaboration. Preliminary test results have met Gelion's performance expectations at this stage of development, validating the technology in a pouch cell format. Joint development activities are continuing, with further results to be announced in due course.\nDevelopment of new partnerships\nGelion continues to engage with a number of new potential global commercialisation partners. These discussions span multiple applications and regions and are aligned with the Company's strategy to establish a diversified portfolio of partnerships with tier-one manufacturers and technology leaders.\nAdditional ARENA Funding\nThe Australian Government, through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), has increased its support for Gelion with a variation to its funding agreement, originally announced in December 2024. The amendment expands the project scope to accelerate the commercialisation of Gelion's sulfur CAM at its Advanced Commercial Prototyping Centre (ACPC), increasing the total project budget from c.\u00a34.8 million to c.\u00a35.3 million.\nThe additional funding is directed toward accelerating the scale-up of Gelion's sulfur CAM fabrication capability. This reflects the commercial traction achieved to date and will support expanding testing and integration activities with existing and prospective partners. The expanded capacity will enable the delivery of larger sample volumes, facilitating more extensive validation and feedback.\nThis funding increase positions the project to progress the commercialisation pathway more rapidly than originally planned, with an increased focus on global supply chain development, process robustness and product qualification, thereby enhancing the overall value and impact of the ACPC programme.\nHalf year results and investor presentation:\nGelion expects to publish its unaudited half year results for the six months ended 31 December 2025 on Monday, 2 March 2026. A retail investor presentation will follow on the same day at 9.30am GMT via the Investor Meet Company platform, hosted by John Wood, CEO and Amit Gupta, CFO. The presentation is open to all existing and prospective shareholders.\nRegistration:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/gelion-plc/register-investor\nQuestions may be submitted in advance through the Investor Meet Company dashboard up to 8.30am GMT on the day of the presentation, or at any time during the live event. Investors who already follow Gelion on the platform will be automatically invited.\nJohn Wood, CEO of Gelion, said:\n\"\nI am delighted to report that we are executing effectively against the roadmap presented to shareholders in November. The delivery of CAM samples to our partners TDK and QinetiQ, together with the successful manufacture of initial pouch cells by TDK, represents tangible progress toward the commercialisation of our technology. We remain focused on converting our strong pipeline of discussions into formal partnerships and delivering long-term value for shareholders.\n\"\nFor more information, please visit\nNext-Generation Sulfur Battery Technologies | Gelion\nor contact:\nGelion plc\nJohn Wood, CEOAmit Gupta, CFO\nvia Tavistock\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated and Financial Adviser)Christopher Raggett / Rob Patrick / Harry Marshall\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital\n(Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Mike Seabrook / Adam Pollock\n+44 (0) 20 3179 5300\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nJos Pinnington / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nTavistock (Financial & Corporate PR)\nSimon Hudson / Nick Elwes / Saskia Sizen\n+44 20 7920 3150\ngelion@tavistock.co.uk\nMarket Abuse Regulation\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nAbout Gelion\nGelion plc is a global energy\n\u2011\nstorage innovator developing next\n\u2011\ngeneration battery technologies that aim to accelerate the clean energy transition by delivering sustainable, high\n\u2011\nperformance, cost\n\u2011\neffective solutions.

He will provide strategic guidance on battery technology development, supporting Gelion's development of sulfur battery innovations.\nProfessor Yazami, widely recognised as a world leading battery technologist, is well-known for his pioneering work in establishing the reversible intercalation of lithium into graphite in an electrochemical cell, a breakthrough which led to the lithium-graphite anode which is now used in commercial lithium-ion batteries, a product with over $80 billion in market value\n[1]\n.\nProf. Yazami is highly awarded and recognized within global the battery science community. He is personally motivated by the potential of advanced energy storage technology and Gelion is honoured to have him recognise and share the same vision for sulfur battery technology to make a positive contribution to the energy transition and to join Gelion on its mission to unlock its full potential.\nGelion is developing its sulfur cathode material toward being a drop-in alternative for the existing standard Lithium-Ion Cathode material options used in LFP and NMC cells. As such, Gelion's goal encompasses pairing the Gelion Cathodes with the standard Graphitic anodes that use the intercalation methods that Prof. Yazami invented and pioneered.\nJohn Wood, CEO of Gelion, said:\n\"Sulfur battery chemistry has enormous potential to extend the capabilities of the energy storage industry. Gelion is moving quickly to explore new technological frontiers. Advanced battery technology requires expansive thinking by people who can visualize and conceptualize at a deeper level.\n\"Prof. Yazami is a powerful thinker who understands the fundamental mechanisms inside the cells in a comprehensive way. Being able to bring Prof. Yazami together with our founder Prof. Thomas Maschmeyer and advisor Prof. Markus Antonietti establishes an exciting nexus of brilliance available to Gelion both for what they can contribute directly and for the technology leadership, inspiration and experience they can bring to our talented science team.\n\"I am very grateful for Prof. Yazami's support for Gelion's important mission.\"\nProf. Rachid Yazami added:\n\"I am thrilled to join Gelion's team as an advisor on this exciting Li-S battery commercialisation project. The Li-S technology offers great improvement opportunities and is seen as a serious alternative to the lithium-ion battery in various domains of applications.\n\"Li-S batteries are cost-effective, high-energy density, safe and long-lasting. With the Gelion team under the guidance of John Wood, I will strive to make the commercialisation of the Li-S technology a successful reality.\"\nAbout Prof. Yazami\nProf. Yazami is very active today advancing battery effectiveness, capabilities, and safety.\nIn terms of battery effectiveness, Prof. Yazami has established a universal (empirical) law that applies to primary and rechargeable batteries, that is the state of charge is a linear function of entropy and enthalpy which makes it possible to better establish the state of charge of any cell. This breakthrough is being advanced within Prof. Yazami's independent startup KVI PTE LTD.\nIn terms of safety, Prof. Yazami has developed a new method based on entropymetry to detect an early stage of an internal short circuit within a battery cell, therefore making batteries safer.\nMost recently Prof. Yazami invented a new method enabling ultra-fast charging (UFC) lithium-ion batteries in 10 minutes and below, even while increasing battery capacity that uses breakthrough fundamental understanding that has recently been proven by testing with Caltech.\nCONTACTS\nGelion plc\nJohn Wood, CEOAmit Gupta, CFO\nvia Alma\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated and Financial Adviser)Christopher Raggett / Rob Patrick / Harry Marshall\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital\n(Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Mike Seabrook / Adam Pollock\n+44 (0) 20 3179 5300\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nJos Pinnington / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nAlma Strategic Communications\n(Financial PR)Justine James / Hannah Campbell / Rose Docherty\n+44 (0) 20 3405 0205\ngelion@almastrategic.com\nAbout Gelion\nGelion (\"gel: ion\") is a global energy storage innovator, supporting the transition to a more sustainable economy by commercialising globally important next generation battery technologies: Sulfur based, Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S), Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) and Zinc-based (Zn) hybrid cells to electrify mobile and stationary applications.
