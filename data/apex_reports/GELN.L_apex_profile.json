It builds on Gelion's recent commercial and technical progress, including\n:\n\u00b7\nThe Materials Testing Agreement with a Tier One battery manufacturer;\n\u00b7\nA strategic collaboration with the Max Planck Institute (Germany); and\n\u00b7\nStrong early performance data demonstrating superior power capability, outstanding longevity, and high energy density, key metrics required for commercial success.\nGelion CEO John Wood said\n: \"We are very grateful to ARENA and the Australian government for this critical support for prototyping capabilities associated with the commercial progression of our Sulfur Battery technologies.\n\"With the acquisition of the Oxis technology portfolio from Johnson Matthey, the acquisition of OXLiD in the UK, and the most recent collaboration agreement with the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, Gelion is now well-positioned to progress with the ACPC project with its goals to produce and optimise our next generation Lithium Sulfur (Li-S) and Silicon Sulfur (Si-S) battery technologies and our readiness to provide these for test and validation by prospective global partners and customers. This is an essential next step toward accelerating global presence and growth.\n\"\nGelion's lightweight sulfur batteries are particularly suited to high-growth sectors such as electric aviation, electric vehicles, and specific stationary energy storage applications, including remote power supply.\nThe Board believes that the commencement of the ACPC with ARENA's funding support, along with recent progress, firmly establishes Gelion as a leader in the development and commercialisation of next-generation sulfur battery technologies.\nCONTACTS\nGelion plc\nJohn Wood, CEOAmit Gupta, CFO\nProf. Thomas Maschmeyer (Founder and Director)\nvia Alma\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated and Financial Adviser)Christopher Raggett / Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital\n(Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Mike Seabrook / Adam Pollock\n+44 (0) 20 3179 5300\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nJos Pinnington / Guy McDougall (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nAlma Strategic Communications\n(Financial PR)Justine James / Hannah Campbell / Rose Docherty\n+44 (0) 20 3405 0205\ngelion@almastrategic.com\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nAbout Gelion\nGelion (\"gel: ion\") is a global energy storage innovator, supporting the transition to a more sustainable economy by commercialising globally important next generation battery technologies: Sulfur based, Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S), Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) and Zinc-based (Zn) hybrid cells to electrify mobile and stationary applications and battery recycling technology.\nGelion plc (the Group) is listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market and wholly owns UK based OXLiD Ltd and Battery Minerals Ltd and Australia based Gelion Technologies Pty Ltd. Gelion is designing and delivering innovative battery technology to enable that transition and return value for its customers and investors.\nIn addition, Gelion is also delivering commercial Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) projects through its Integration Solutions business.\nSulfur Batteries\nGelion's effort is directed at the potential for sulfur-based cathode active materials (CAMs) to deliver low-cost & sustainable batteries with compelling performance. In the case of Li-S batteries, the target is a high-performance light-weight battery for the EV and e-aviation market. In the case of Na-S batteries, the target is an ultra-low-cost advancement on batteries currently employed in the stationary storage and economy EV market. The company's overarching goal is to help make global transport, energy consumption and storage more sustainable.\nGlossary\nAh\nAmpere hours. A measure of capacity stored in the cell. The larger the number the higher the capacity.\nEnergy density (Wh/kg)\nThe ratio of energy stored per unit weight i.e. Watt-hours per kilogram. The higher the number the lighter the battery.\nPouch cell\nAn industry standard format of a battery which comprises a flat pouch-shaped design with a multi-layered laminate structure.\nCycle life\nThe number of full charge and discharge cycles a battery can complete before its capacity falls below a specified level, typically 80% of the original capacity. Higher cycle life indicates longer-lasting performance.\n[1]\nThe movement in foreign exchange rates has led to a change in the reported grant amount. However, since both the grant funding and the project expenditure are in AUD, this has no material financial impact other than for reporting purposes.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Therefore, the total number of voting rights will also be 229,351,783. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe New Ordinary Shares, when issued, will be credited as fully paid and will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with each other and with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.\nCapitalised terms not otherwise defined in the text of this announcement have the meanings given in the Circular published on 20 October 2025.\nEnquiries\n:\nGelion plc\nJohn Wood, CEOAmit Gupta, CFO\nProf. Thomas Maschmeyer (Founder and Director)\nvia Alma\nStrand Hanson Limited\n(Nominated and Financial Adviser)Christopher Raggett / Rob Patrick / Harry Marshall\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nOberon Capital\n(Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Mike Seabrook / Adam Pollock\n+44 (0) 20 3179 5300\nAllenby Capital Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nJos Pinnington /\nLauren Wright\n(Sales and Corporate Broking)\nAlex Brearley / Ashur Joseph (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3328 5656\nAlma Strategic Communications\n(Financial PR)Justine James / Hannah Campbell / Rose Docherty\n+44 (0) 20 3405 0205\ngelion@almastrategic.com\nThe Notification of Dealing Form set out below is provided in accordance with the requirements of the EU Market Abuse Regulation, as it forms part of UK law.\n1.\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na)\nName:\na) Steve Mahon\nb) Graham Cooley\nc) John Wood\nd) Michael Davie\ne) Thomas Maschmeyer\nf) Joycelyn Morton\ng)\nLouis Adriaenssens\n2.\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status:\na) Non-Executive Chair (Director)\nb) Non-Executive Director\n(Director)\nc) Chief Executive Offer (Director)\nd) Non-Executive Director (Director)\ne) Non-Executive Director (Director)\nf)\nNon-Executive Director\n(Director)\ng) Chief Technology Officer (PDMR)\nb)\nInitial notification/Amendment:\nInitial notification\n3.\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName:\nGelion plc\nb)\nLEI:\n2138008NC7YL3MCUDR84\n4.\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument:\nIdentification code:\nOrdinary shares of 0.1p each (\"Ordinary Shares\")\nGB00BNBQZD59\nb)\nNature of the transaction:\nPurchase of new Ordinary Shares\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s):\nPrice(s)\nVolume(s)\na) 20p\n125,000\nb) 20p\n625,000\nc) 20p\n125,000\nd) 20p\n125,000\ne) 20p\n50,000\nf) 20p\n75,000\ng) 20p\n25,000\nd)\nAggregated information:\n\u00b7\u00a0Aggregated volume:\n\u00b7\u00a0Price:\nn/a, each a single transaction\ne)\nDate of the transaction:\n7 November 2025\nf)\nPlace of the transaction:\nOutside a trading venue\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
