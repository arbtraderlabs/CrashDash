natural resources company, announces its unaudited interim results for the six months to 30 June 2025.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nI am pleased to present the interim report for the Company covering its results for the six months ended 30 June 2025.\nFinancial Review\nThe Company generated a profit of US$3,723,690 in the period, the majority of which comprised of write-backs associated with the Company Voluntary Arrangement (\"CVA\") amounting to US$3,986,419, which was formally completed in February 2025.\nThe net cash position was US$68,212 as at 30 June 2025, the Company raised gross proceeds of US$274,629 on 30 June 2025 through the placing of new ordinary shares (see Note 4) to strengthen the financial position of the Company, these funds were received on 2 July 2025, (US$20,465 net cash as at 31 December 2024).\nWith a basic profit per share of US$0.002\u00a0(period ended 30 June 2024: loss per share US$0.005).\nGiven the nature of the business and its development strategy, it is unlikely that the Board will recommend a dividend in the immediate future.\nPost Reporting Date Developments & Outlook\nThe Company continues to explore opportunities within the natural resources sector, including an existing non-operated gas production facility with gas storage potential, as well as the potential acquisition of a non-operated interest in a near-term oil field.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our consulting and advisory team for their hard work, and our shareholders for their ongoing support.\nRichard Glass\nChairman and Non-Executive

Directors.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n1.\nGeneral Information and Basis of Preparation\nThe Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales as a public limited company. The Company's registered number is 09976843 and its registered office is at Salisbury House, London Wall, EC2M 5PS.\nOn 4 October 2017, the Company's shares were admitted to the Official List (by way of Standard Listing) and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market.\nWith effect from admission, the Company has been subject to the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (and the resulting jurisdiction of the UK Listing Authority) to the extent such rules apply to companies with a Standard Listing pursuant to Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules.\nThe principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company for its subsidiaries, as well as performing all administrative, corporate finance, strategic and governance functions of the Group. The Company's investments comprise of subsidiaries operating in the natural gas sector.\nThe Company has the following subsidiary undertakings:\nName\nCountry of incorporation\nIssued capital\nProportion held by Group at reporting date\nActivity\nCoos Bay Energy, LLC\nUSA\nMembership interests\n100%\nHolding company\nWestport Energy Acquisitions, Inc.\nUSA\nShares\n100%\nHolding company\nWestport Energy, LLC\nUSA\nMembership interests\n100%\nOil and gas exploration\nMore information on the individual group companies and timing of their acquisition is presented in the Company's audited consolidated financial information and notes thereto for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n2.\nAccounting Policies\nThe Group Financial statements are presented in US Dollars (\"US$\").\nBasis of Preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations (\"IFRS\") and the requirements of the Companies Act, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nThe preparation of the Group financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the Directors to exercise their judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The Group's accounting policies as well as the areas involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group financial statements are disclosed in the audited annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024 and are available on the Group's website.\nIn the opinion of the management, the interim unaudited consolidated financial information includes all adjustments considered necessary for fair and consistent presentation of this financial information. The interim unaudited consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and notes for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nGoing Concern\nThe Group Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.\nThe Board has considered this\nin light of\nthe Company's recent recapitalisation and debt restructuring efforts, which took the form of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (\"CVA\"). The terms of the CVA, approved at meetings of the creditors and shareholders on 5 September 2024, were that all amounts owed will be settled via a mix of cash and convertible loan notes. A placing of \u00a3340,000 was undertaken by the Company's broker, Peterhouse Capital Limited, and following the CVA vote and general meeting, the funds have been released to satisfy the CVA and for the Company to fund its future operations, having taken full legal effect on 19 February 2025. Furthermore, the Company undertook a placing of new ordinary shares for cash during the interim period to 30 June 2025, raising a total of \u00a3299,000 in additional funds before expenses to progress the Company's reverse takeover efforts and to provide for general working capital requirements.\nThe Directors note that, notwithstanding the debt reduction and capitalisation enabled by the CVA and multiple placings referenced above, the Group will need additional funding to continue operations for the foreseeable future, noting however the cost basis of the Company post the CVA and prior to any transaction is expected to remain low. The Directors are confident\u00a0however that the Group will continue to be able to raise sufficient funds as and when required to enable it to continue to meet its financial obligations as they fall due for at least the next 12 months from the date of approval of the Group Interim Financial Statements. The Group Interim Financial Statements have therefore been prepared on\nthe\ngoing concern basis.\nHowever, as there can be no certainty that over\naccess to future funding by the Company prior to the completion of a suitable transaction, there exists a material uncertainty as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company, its subsidiaries. More information on the individual Group companies, details and timing of their acquisition is presented in the Company's audited consolidated financial information and notes thereto for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nAt the time of its acquisition by the Company, Coos Bay Energy, LLC consisted of Coos Bay Energy, LLC and its wholly owned US Group. It is the Directors' opinion that the Company at the date of acquisition of Coos Bay Energy, LLC did not meet the definition of a business as defined by IFRS 3 and therefore the acquisition is outside on the IFRS 3 scope. Where a party to an acquisition fails to satisfy the definition of a business, as defined by IFRS 3, management have decided to adopt a \"merger accounting\" method of consolidation as the most relevant method to be used.\nThe Group consistently applies it to all similar transactions in the following way:\n-\nthe acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their existing carrying values rather than at fair value;\n-\nno goodwill is recorded;\n-\nall intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions are eliminated from the beginning of the first comparative period or inception, whichever is earlier;\n-\ncomparative periods are restated from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented based on the assumption that the companies have always been together;\n-\nall the pre-acquisition accumulated losses of the legal acquiree are assumed by the Group as if the companies have always been together;\n-\nall the share capital and membership capital contributions of all the companies included into the legal acquiree sub-group less the Company's cost of investment into these companies are included into the merger reserve; and\n-\nthe Company's called up share capital is restated at the preceding reporting date to reflect the value of the new shares that would have been issued to acquire the merged company had the merger taken place at the first day of the comparative period. Where new shares have been issued during the current period that increased net assets (other than as consideration for the merger), these are recorded from their actual date of issue and are not included in the comparative statement of financial position.\nThe results and cash flows of all the combining entities were brought into the financial statements of the combined entity from the beginning of the financial year in which the combination occurred, adjusted so as to achieve uniformity of accounting policies. The comparative information was restated by including the total comprehensive income for all the combining entities for the previous reporting period and their statement of financial position for the previous reporting date, adjusted as necessary to achieve uniformity of accounting policies.\nAt 30 June 2025, 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024, the Group results include the results of Corpus Resources Plc, Coos Bay Energy, LLC, Westport Energy Acquisitions, Inc. and Westport Energy, LLC.\n2. Segmental Analysis\nIn the opinion of the Directors, the Group is primarily organised into a single operating segment. This is consistent with the Group's internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker. Separate segmental disclosures have therefore not been included.\n3. Profit/(Loss) Per Share\nThe basic profit/(loss) per share is derived by dividing the profit/(loss) for the period/year attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue. Diluted profit/(loss) per share is derived by dividing the profit/(loss) for the period/year, attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.\nThe following reflects the profit/(loss) per share data used in the basic and diluted profit/(loss) per share computations:\nFor six monthsended30 June 2025Unaudited\nFor six monthsended30 June 2024Unaudited\nFor yearended31 December 2024Audited\nProfit/(loss) after tax (US$)\n3,862,016\n(510,956)\n(642,087)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 in issue\n1,713,306,796\n99,639,565\n1,232,973,465\nProfit/(loss) per share - basic and fully diluted (US$)\n0.002\n(0.005)\n(0.001)\nAt 30 June 2025, 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024, there were no potentially dilutive instruments in issue\nthat could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future.\n4.

Each Deferred Share carries no rights and is deemed effectively valueless.\nIssued Ordinary Shares for the Interim Period to 30 June 2025\nOn 19 February 2025, the Company raised \u00a399,000, before expenses, through a placing of 659,999,997 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each (\"Ordinary Shares\"). The Placing Shares each have an attaching grant of warrants (\"Warrants\") on a one-for-one basis.\nOn 30 June 2025, the Company raised \u00a3200,000, before expense, through a placing of 1,333,333,333 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each (\"Ordinary Shares\"). The Placing Shares each have an attaching grant of warrants (\"Warrants\") on a one-for-one basis.\nWarrants\nThe following warrants were issued in relation to the issued shares for the period/year.\n2025\nNumber of\nwarrants\n2024\nNumber of\nwarrants\nOutstanding at the beginning of the year\n1,133,333,900\n-\nGranted during the period/year\n1,993,333,330\n1,133,333,900\nLapsed during the period/year\n-\n-\nExercised during the period/year\n-\n-\nOutstanding at the end of the period/year\n3,126,667,230\n1,133,333,900\nVested and exercisable at the end of the period/year\n-\n-\nThe exercise price of warrants, outstanding on 30 June 2025, was \u00a30.0005 (31 December 2024: \u00a30.0005) Their weighted average remaining contractual life was 3.36 years (31 December 2024: 4.72 years).\nThe weighted average share price (at the date of exercise) of warrants, exercised during the period, was nil (31 December 2024: nil) as no warrants were exercised.\nCalculation of volatility involves significant judgement by the Directors due to the absence of the historical trading data for the Company at the date of the grant. Volatility number above was estimated based on the range of 3-5 year month-end volatilities extracted from the FTSE AIM all-Share index.\n5.
