Cash outlook remains in line with expectations and the Company continues to have sufficient cash runway through to mid-2027.\nThe backdrop is stabilising after last year's uncertainty and disruption across the NHS. During the Period there has been increased\u00a0focus from policy makers and NHS management on the role of technology and digitisation in reducing NHS waiting times, combined with moves towards neighbourhood healthcare. This is supported by commitments to increase NHS technology spend.\nBleepa is well positioned given its proven capabilities and capacity to address analogue to digital and facilitate hospital to community, combined with its ability to help reduce waiting lists. As last year's disruption passes and given the increasing focus on technology and the flexibility of the Company's solutions, management expects that sales momentum could build around the next tax year, with the Company positioned to scale quickly and effectively.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO of Feedback plc, said:\n\"The 10-year plan and direction of travel of the NHS are clearly aligned with the solutions we provide.
