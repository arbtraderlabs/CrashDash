Cash outlook remains in line with expectations and the Company continues to have sufficient cash runway through to mid-2027.\nThe backdrop is stabilising after last year's uncertainty and disruption across the NHS. During the Period there has been increased\u00a0focus from policy makers and NHS management on the role of technology and digitisation in reducing NHS waiting times, combined with moves towards neighbourhood healthcare. This is supported by commitments to increase NHS technology spend.\nBleepa is well positioned given its proven capabilities and capacity to address analogue to digital and facilitate hospital to community, combined with its ability to help reduce waiting lists. As last year's disruption passes and given the increasing focus on technology and the flexibility of the Company's solutions, management expects that sales momentum could build around the next tax year, with the Company positioned to scale quickly and effectively.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO of Feedback plc, said:\n\"The 10-year plan and direction of travel of the NHS are clearly aligned with the solutions we provide.

Cash outlook remains in line with expectations and the Company continues to have sufficient cash runway through to mid-2027.\nThe backdrop is stabilising after last year's uncertainty and disruption across the NHS. During the Period there has been increased\u00a0focus from policy makers and NHS management on the role of technology and digitisation in reducing NHS waiting times, combined with moves towards neighbourhood healthcare. This is supported by commitments to increase NHS technology spend.\nBleepa is well positioned given its proven capabilities and capacity to address analogue to digital and facilitate hospital to community, combined with its ability to help reduce waiting lists. As last year's disruption passes and given the increasing focus on technology and the flexibility of the Company's solutions, management expects that sales momentum could build around the next tax year, with the Company positioned to scale quickly and effectively.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO of Feedback plc, said:\n\"The 10-year plan and direction of travel of the NHS are clearly aligned with the solutions we provide. Spending Review funding is due to be released to the NHS frontline for 2026/27, and we believe that this combined with an increasing recognition of the role of technology in healthcare will drive a new phase of commercialisation for Feedback.\"\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nEmma Oswick, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback plc\nFeedback plc liberates the data and knowledge from multiple healthcare IT systems and delivers better workflow to enable clinicians to communicate, collaborate and provide the best healthcare for their patients.

The simulation highlights how well positioned Bleepa is to be an integral part of this.\nThe Neighbourhood Health Service\nThe Neighbourhood Health Service is aimed at delivering more integrated and proactive care, moving away from hospital-centric and towards community-based services. This involves strengthening connections between different health and care providers, including GPs, community health services, mental health support, and local authorities.\nThe goal is to improve health and wellbeing for all Londoners, particularly those with complex needs, by addressing both medical and non-medical factors that impact health.\nThe plans and delivery involve many key stakeholders, both from a central and local perspective, to work together including NHS England, the Greater London Authority, London Councils, the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, integrated care boards and local authorities across all London boroughs and the voluntary sector.\nFor more information please visit:\nNHS England - London \u00bb London unveils vision for a neighbourhood health service to transform care across the capital\nSimon Morioka and Claire Kennedy, joint Chief Executives of PPL, commented:\n\"It was thrilling to deliver the first ever simulation of the neighbourhood health service along with our colleagues from across the health and care sector. The feedback from everyone taking part has been \"hugely positive with lots of learnings. There is a positive and optimistic sentiment about the new way of working that this model offers. We're excited that this has the potential to improve the health of the nation.\"\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO commented\n:\n\"We were privileged to join the PPL team and the simulation participants during the two-day experience to provide a demo version of Bleepa as the connected digital infrastructure to enable greater collaboration and communication. This simulation demonstrates Bleepa's capability to provide the crucial technology layer to facilitate the transition to neighbourhood delivery and we look forward to further supporting the Neighbourhood Health Service through its inception.\n\"We were able to get invaluable insights into how services might work across health and care providers and how our technology can help to strengthen those connections, provide one view of resident information, capture clinical decision making, and ultimately improve care coordination.\"\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl /Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback plc\nFeedback plc liberates the data and knowledge from multiple healthcare IT systems and delivers better workflow to enable clinicians to communicate, collaborate and provide the best healthcare for their patients.

          "full_content": "28 Apr 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 3659G\nFeedback PLC\n28 April 2025\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information pursuant to Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 as amended.\u00a0Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFeedback plc\nTrading Update\nFeedback plc (AIM: FDBK, \"Feedback\" or the \"Company\"), the clinical infrastructure specialist, provides a trading update for the year-ended 31 May 2025 (the \"Period\").\nThe backdrop of the merging of NHS England (\"NHSE\") with the Department of Health and Social Care (\"DHSC\"), and the drive for a 50% reduction of operational costs across NHS Trusts and Integrated Care Boards (\"ICBs\") at a national level, in addition to multiple changes to funding programmes being announced by the government and the NHS, have resulted in increased levels of near-term uncertainty and a delay in expected contract awards.\nRevenue for the Period is now expected to be c. \u00a30.9m (2024: \u00a31.18m). The Company continues to conservatively manage its finances and remains well funded with cash and short-term investments of \u00a36.6m as at 31 March 2025 following the successful \u00a36.1m (gross) fundraise in November 2024.\nChanging Environment\nFor NHS 2025/26, the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") has now been rolled into wider NHS funding and no longer exists as a dedicated fund with a national price for diversion payments. The ERF has been replaced by a fixed funding allocation to ICBs for elective recovery (totalling \u00a35.3bn* for 2025/26), linked to ICB indicative activity plans which we believe must be submitted by 31 May 2025, and places increased pressure on ICBs to deliver activity within a fixed financial envelope.\nThe end of the national price for diversion payments under ERF provides greater contracting flexibility between the Company and ICBs as it stands to be paid for every patient hosted on the platform instead of linking payment to the number of successful diversions, aligning to Feedback's standard G-Cloud pricing and licencing model. The Company believes the increased financial pressures and simpler model of licensing will make its products more compelling and accessible to customers and remains confident that once the current landscape settles, ICBs will be positioned to finalise budgeting decisions.\nContinued Opportunity\nThe Company continues to progress contract conversations with a growing number of ICBs at a local level and remains positive about the broader environment and opportunity - especially with the continued focus on waitlist rationalisation within the NHS, and the compelling workflow and cost benefits that Feedback provides. The increasing focus on digitisation and the flexibility of the Company's solutions - which can be tailored to the broader changing landscape, underpin management's confidence that Feedback remains positioned to generate strong returns. Together with our primary care partner the Company continues to pursue opportunities linked to the government's Neighbourhood Health model which we believe is likely to form a key component of the NHS 10-Year plan and lead to opportunities later in the year.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO of Feedback plc, said:\n\"With ICBs focusing on cost reductions and operational efficiency we believe that there will be increasing need for innovative productivity solutions such as Bleepa. While there is an element of turmoil, ICBs and Trusts will remain critical in commissioning. We believe that there will be increased clarity on the NHS position as we head into the summer, following the publication of the 10-year plan and Spending Review and that these, along with the submission of ICB indicative activity plans, will create the stability to allow NHS organisations to contract with providers such as Feedback.\n\"We remain excited by the opportunity and were delighted that along with Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (\"QVH\") we were recently awarded the 'Most Effective Contribution to Clinical Redesign Award' at the HSJ Partnership Awards 2025 for reducing patient wait times and unnecessary hospital appointments through a digital breathlessness pathway. The recognition for significantly reducing waiting times for patients, improving productivity for NHS staff and reducing unnecessary appointments provides a strong reference point for the wider market.\"\n*\nNHS England \u00bb Allocation of resources 2025/26\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley/Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback plc\nFeedback plc ",

This includes the surrender of options by, and the grant of Options to, Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibilities (PDMRs) of the Company.\nThe Board recognises the importance of share options to appropriately incentivise and retain talent, as well as to ensure their interests are aligned with that of the Company and its shareholders. Following a review, the Remuneration Committee of the Company recommended that the terms of the existing share option grants for employees and directors were no longer appropriate, and the Board adopted in full its recommendations that they should be replaced to re-align grants under the share option schemes with the current strategic focus of the Company.\nAccordingly, 976,420 share options shall be surrendered for nominal consideration by mutual agreement, immediately prior to the grant of new Options as detailed below.\nGrant of Options\n3,505,169 Options are being granted to the Executive Directors and other\nPDMRs as set out below\n(being 89.4 percent. of the new Options granted). The Options will vest in four equal tranches, conditional on achieving certain targets as follows:\n1. 25% vest immediately - to create a retention mechanism from grant;\n2. 25% vest on Reported Revenue of \u00a38.0m;\n3.\n25% vest on Reported Revenue of \u00a312.0m\n;\nand\n4.\n25% vest on Reported Revenue of \u00a320.0m\n.\n\"Reported Revenue\"\nis either:\n\u00b7\na year's revenue reported in the full year audited financial statements; or\n\u00b7\n12 months' revenue being H2 of the last full year audited financial statements plus H1 of the last published interim financial statements.\nOptions being granted to the Executive Directors and PDMRs which are subject to the vesting conditions above:\nSurrendered options\nNew Options granted / grant date\nResultant number of options held\nTom Oakley, CEO\n533,385\n550,668\nNon tax-Advantaged Options / 14/01/2025\n1,201,918 EMI Options\n/ 14/01/2025\n1,752,586\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n266,692\n42,930 EMI Options\n/ 14/01/2025\n833,361 EMI Options\n/ 25/02/2025\n876,291\nMichael Hayball, CTO*\n20,065\n219,073 EMI Options\n/ 14/01/2025\n219,073\nStephen Brown, Chief Regulatory & Compliance Officer\n20,065\n219,073 EMI Options\n/ 14/01/2025\n219,073\nStephen McAteer, COO*\n20,065\n219,073 EMI Options\n/ 14/01/2025\n219,073\nNicholas Mayhew, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer*\n20,065\n219,073 EMI Options\n/ 14/01/2025\n219,073\n* Employed by Feedback Medical Limited, a 100% subsidiary of Feedback plc\n.\nNon tax-advantaged Options granted on 14/01/2025 to the Executive Directors and PDMRs above have an exercise price of 1 pence per share, being the nominal value per Ordinary Share reflecting the non-tax-advantaged nature of these Options.\nEMI Options granted on 14/01/2025 to the Executive Directors and PDMRs above have an exercise price of 20.8 pence per share, being equal to the closing share price on the last trading day before the grant and representing a premium of 4% to the price at which the Company last completed an equity fundraise in November 2024 (20 pence).\nEMI Options awarded with a grant date of 25/02/2025 to the Executive Directors and PDMRs above will have an exercise price being the higher of 20 pence per share or the closing share price on the last trading day before such grant.\nIn addition, Rory Shaw, Non-Executive Chairman and PDMR, has been granted 100,000 Non tax-Advantaged Options on 14/01/2025 primarily for retention purposes. Alongside the Executive management team, Rory has key relationships with NHS bodies which are potential customers for the Company's products. These Non tax-Advantaged Options have an exercise price of 20 pence and are subject to time-based vesting conditions only with the options vesting in equal monthly tranches over three years. Following the grant of Options, Rory Shaw will hold a total of 187,000 options, including 87,000 of options previously awarded with exercise prices ranging from 140 - 372 pence.\nIn addition, 315,700\nOptions were granted to 16 other employees on 14/01/2025,\nwith\nthe same exercise price and vesting conditions as the Executive Directors and PDMRs as set out above\n.\nThe Options are exercisable for a period of 5 years from the vesting date.\nFollowing the surrender of existing options and the grant of new Options, the Company will have a total of 4,010,875 options to subscribe for ordina",

          "full_content": "18 Dec 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 4630Q\nFeedback PLC\n18 December 2024\nPrior to publication, the information contained within this announcement was deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 (\"MAR\"). With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFeedback plc\nHalf Year Trading Update\nFeedback plc (AIM: FDBK, \"Feedback\" or the \"Company\"), the clinical infrastructure specialist,\nannounces a trading update for the six months to 30 November 2024 (the \"Period\").\nFinancial Highlights\nReported revenue\nfor the Period is expected to be broadly flat at approximately \u00a30.4m (H1 2024: \u00a3\n0.4m)\n, of which approximately 90% is from Bleepa (H1 2024: 77%)\nAt the end of the Period the Company completed a successful upscaled fundraising and retail offer, raising gross proceeds of approximately \u00a36.1m (\u00a35.6m net proceeds). The funds are earmarked to drive growth through the collaboration agreement with a large UK primary care partner (which was announced on 19 September 2024), provide funding to roll out Bleepa for Integrated Care Boards (\"ICBs\") under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\"), and provide on-going working capital for the Group.\nCash and cash equivalents as at 30 November 2024 were c.\u00a37.3m (30 November 2023: \u00a35.4m). Approximately \u00a35.1m in net proceeds from the fundraise was received in the Period, with the remaining approximately \u00a30.5m net proceeds being received shortly after Period end.\nOperational Highlights\nDuring the Period the Company established key partnerships with a view to strengthening its position within the ongoing Government drive to embed digitisation as part of the broader focus on reducing wait lists and pressures on the NHS. As such, the Company is positioned for a step change in commercial prospects notably on the back of the ERF funding mechanism and Neighbourhood Diagnostics Platform collaboration announced during the Period.\nElective Recovery Fund\nNow that Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance (\"DEAG\") diversions achieved through the Bleepa\u00a0platform are eligible for reimbursement under the ERF, the need for NHS capital funding is removed - any ICB or hospital in England can utilise the ERF, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on Bleepa.\nThis has the potential to be highly significant for the Company - with an indicative ICB contract expected to generate over approximately \u00a32m per ICB, per annum. While the current ERF programme is scheduled to run until 31 March 2025, central conversations indicate that the commonly held view is that elective recovery is a key priority for the NHS into next year and beyond. The Company is currently in active discussions with several ICBs and continues to focus on converting the growing pipeline.\nNeighbourhood Diagnostics\nFeedback has also collaborated with a provider of primary care solutions to create a Neighbourhood Diagnostics Platform (\"NDP\") with a focus on increasing diagnosis and treatment in the community and the desire to shift to a digital NHS with a Digital Health Record for each patient.\nThe Company has since entered into a memorandum of understanding with its partner and an NHS Trust to implement a pilot, which will provide a reference point for scaling opportunities of an optimised GP referral process and subsequently the NDP. The aim is to provide a potential route to rapidly scale the Bleepa solution through a pathway approach, enabling the Government's vision of a digital-first, community centric healthcare system. This could potentially redirect over 190m routine diagnostic tests per year to a community setting, addressing a total addressable market worth \u00a3382m annually (of which Feedback estimates its share to be worth approximately \u00a3191m).\nOutlook\nThe Board believes that Bleepa is uniquely positioned to address one of the key underlying challenges to NHS reform and is perfectly aligned with the strategic aims of the Government, proposed NHS digitisation and a shift to delivery of care in communities via a neighbourhood health service. Importantly, the recent fundraising both enables the Company to build scale for implementation and provides a runway for delivery.\nFurther to unlocking ERF reimbursement, the Company is encouraged by the growing pipeline of opportunities and is actively pursuing engagements with multiple ICBs with the expectation to convert some of these in Q1/Q2 next year. ICB contracts remain the nearest term opportunity to build meaningful revenues streams, however, conversations with central and national teams are ongoing.\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\n",

We design products that enhance clinician access to patient data and to their colleagues. Our unique approach centres around individual patient episodes, into which we pull relevant clinical data from hospital systems and around which we build remote clinical teams for collaboration. As a result, we produce a digital infrastructure that makes patient data available to clinicians in multiple settings, in a format that enables them to meaningfully interact with it, providing flexibility to clinicians and free movement of patients between provider settings - clinicians can practice from anywhere and patients can attend any care provider for treatment, with greater connectivity across organisations.\nOur products Bleepa\u00ae and CareLocker\u00ae work together to deliver unparalleled value to our customers. Bleepa\u00ae is our application layer and sits on top of CareLocker\u00ae as our data layer. Bleepa\u00ae is a clinician facing platform that displays clinical results from a patient's CareLocker\u00ae at a certified and regulated quality, that is suitable for clinical use and enables dialogue on a patient-by-patient basis with colleagues through a secure, auditable chat interface that links back to the patient medical record. The CareLocker\u00ae data storage model is built around the patient. Our vision is one where relevant clinical data is always available to the patient as well as to any care setting that they may attend - a federated data architecture with the patient as the tenant.\nThe Company has a number of growth opportunities domestically and internationally across a range of markets including the NHS and private healthcare providers and its highly scalable Software as a Service (\"SaaS\")-based model is expected to provide increasing levels of revenue visibility as the Company grows its customer base.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company and its partner are actively building interest in the solution and look forward to providing further updates in due course.\nThe Pilot will act as a reference site for national policy and provide a platform from which to launch focused engagement with the central NHS and government with the intention of positioning a business case for wider rollout aligned to the Spring Budget.

We design products that enhance clinician access to patient data and to their colleagues. Our unique approach centres around individual patient episodes, into which we pull relevant clinical data from hospital systems and around which we build remote clinical teams for collaboration. As a result, we produce a digital infrastructure that makes patient data available to clinicians in multiple settings, in a format that enables them to meaningfully interact with it, providing flexibility to clinicians and free movement of patients between provider settings - clinicians can practice from anywhere and patients can attend any care provider for treatment, with greater connectivity across organisations.\nOur products Bleepa\u00ae and CareLocker\u00ae work together to deliver unparalleled value to our customers. Bleepa\u00ae is our application layer and sits on top of CareLocker\u00ae as our data layer. Bleepa\u00ae is a clinician facing platform that displays clinical results from a patient's CareLocker\u00ae at a certified and regulated quality, that is suitable for clinical use and enables dialogue on a patient-by-patient basis with colleagues through a secure, auditable chat interface that links back to the patient medical record. The CareLocker\u00ae data storage model is built around the patient. Our vision is one where relevant clinical data is always available to the patient as well as to any care setting that they may attend - a federated data ",

The Company also intends to announce a retail offer to qualifying retail investors in the United Kingdom to raise up to a further \u00a31 million\n(the \"\nRetail Offer\n\", and together with the Placing and Subscription, the \"\nFundraising\n\").\nNet proceeds of the Fundraising will primarily be used to (1) drive growth through\nthe collaboration agreement announced on 19 September 2024 with a large UK primary care partner.\nThe collaboration provides a potential route to rapidly roll out Bleepa, leveraging the existing footprint of the partner to support national engagement. The combined proposition, as a clinical service rather than a technology sale, would provide access to potential large recurrent pots of core funding;\n(2) provide funding to focus on rolling out Bleepa as a\nDiagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance\nplatform for\nICBs\nunder the ERF to\noptimise the user journey and drive patient referrals from primary care; and (3) net proceeds will also provide on-going working capital for the Group and fund transaction costs.\nCertain Directors\nintend to participate in the Subscription (\"\nDirector Participation\n\"). It is intended that the Director Participation will comprise approximately \u00a330,500 in aggregate through the issue of 152,500 New Ordinary Shares at the Issue Price.\nFurther details will be announced as appropriate in due\ncourse.\u00a0The Subscription is conditional on the Placing.\nFurthermore, as the Company is not permitted by law to issue Ordinary Shares at an issue price which is below their nominal value, currently\n50 pence\nper Existing Ordinary Share, the Company therefore announces that it is carrying out a share capital reorganisation of its existing issued ordinary share capital to subdivide each Existing Ordinary Share into one New Ordinary Share of\none penny\nand one Deferred Share of\u00a049\npence\n.

With Labour emphasising the need to undergo the \"biggest reimagining of the NHS,\" whilst embracing an \"analogue to digital\" approach that moves diagnostics from primary care settings to the community, Bleepa is perfectly positioned to underpin many of the operational requirements having proved this can be delivered by our technology and the diagnostic pathway approach that we have pioneered at QVH. Furthermore, creating a \"Neighbourhood Health Service\" requires a new infrastructure to connect the community providers around the patient which is exactly the infrastructure proposed through our recently announced collaboration with a leading UK primary care record provider and which was called for in a recent Tony Blair Institute paper 'Preparing the NHS for the AI Era: A Digital Health Record for every Citizen*'.\n\"There are also signs of a shift in the NHS's financial landscape. Lord Ara Darzi's review revealed that NHS technology lags about 15 years behind other healthcare systems, with a \u00a337bn capital investment shortfall that must be addressed to support the NHS recovery plan. This indicates a push for renewed technology investment, and the new administration acknowledges the vital role of digital enablement in recovery. Proven technologies like Bleepa, with a strong track record, are well-positioned to seize growth opportunities as financial ",

There are no limitations on the number of patients or pathways that are eligible under the funding mechanism, the more activity delivered and diversions achieved the more an ICB will be reimbursed. Based on the Company's existing programme at Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust,\nthe Company believes that\ndiversion away from outpatient appointments could be achieved in up to 90% of referrals using the DEAG approach,\nwhich would result\nin a significant revenue uplift for the participating ICB/Trust whilst simultaneously driving material efficiencies in service delivery and most importantly benefits for their patients, who would be spared multiple hospital attendances and experience an accelerated journey with up to an estimated 63% reduction in wait times.\nThe diversion payment will be paid directly to the commissioning ICB which will then allocate the funding to the provider Trust delivering the services. Feedback will negotiate locally a share of this ERF payment (alongside its implementation partner below). Based on expected patient volumes once fully rolled out the Company believes that an indicative ICB contract could generate over c. \u00a32m per annum for Feedback under the ERF mechanism (assuming 66k patients per annum and that ERF rolls forward on an un-capped basis annually). ERF currently runs until 31st March 2025 but the Company believes, following central conversations, that the funding may be renewed in subsequent financial years to continue to support waitlist reduction.\nStrategic partnership with implementation partner\nIn order to deliver this solution at scale rapidly, the Company has formed a strategic partnership with Moorhouse Consulting (\"Moorhouse\") as its implementation partner. Moorhouse are experienced practitioners of system implementation and service redesign within the NHS, they have a number of ICB customer connections and a large workforce who can support multiple deployments simultaneously.\nFeedback has already undertaken a roadshow of NHS ICBs, in collaboration with Moorhouse and a number of ICBs have already expressed interest in the Bleepa DEAG approach via the ERF. Now that confirmation of ERF reimbursement has been received, the Company believes that it will soon be able to convert a number of these ICBs into customer contracts.\nImproved customer access\nAs noted above the Company believes that access to ERF represents a step change in the Company's commercial prospects. Although customer desire for Bleepa is well established, contracts have been difficult to unlock due to an inability for sites to source funding for the product. This is in large part because most technology funding is capital based rather than revenue based and is more difficult to ringfence, often being redirected for other priority spend such as to offset staff strikes or building repairs.\nERF is expected to enable the Company to align itself to service-based reimbursement, taking a share of service delivery payments. Service-based payments are typically revenue-based and ringfenced, they are also likely to recur because they underpin core areas of service delivery or to be replaced with a different mechanism that recognises the same elements of service delivery providing greater funding security.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO, Feedback plc said:\n\"ERF is the funding stream that the Company has been looking for in order to deliver our growth potential. It is a funding mechanism that scales as we do. The m",

It is envisaged the solution will also enable some diagnostic procedures to be referred into community settings such as pharmacy or other diagnostic facilities, creating additional\u00a0diagnostic capacity to support NHS waitlist recovery.\nThe parties intend to pilot the solution before pursuing broader national opportunities for contracts. Pilot conversations with customer sites are already underway. A pilot will seek to demonstrate both the continued reduction in outpatient appointment requirement through the combined platform, further reduction in patient wait times through an optimised GP referral process and also the ability to scale the solution at pace to multiple GP practices simultaneously.\nThe collaboration provides a route to rapidly scale the Bleepa solution and pathway approach, leveraging the existing footprint of the party.\nThe Company estimates that over 190m diagnostic tests per year could be redirected to a pharmacy setting. If taken to a national scale this opportunity could represent an estimated total addressable market of \u00a3382m annually with further opportunities for potential international expansion. Commercial revenue from this potential opportunity remains subject to,\ninter alia\n, successful pilots and commercial agreement between the parties.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO, Feedback plc said:\n\"This collaboration aligns to the Secretary of State's vision to move care out of traditional acute provider settings and into the community, closer to patients. If successful it will provide additional capacity to the NHS and help to overcome some of the difficulties being faced by CDCs, such as recruitment challenges, by enabling redirection to fully staffed facilities. It will also offer patients' choice and the convenience of attending their local high street for routine NHS investigations with, we believe,\nshorter wait times.\n\"Lord Darzi's paper, released on Thursday 12th September, calls directly for this solution. Given the impact that the combined product can deliver and the ability to leverage our partners existing footprint to scale the solution the Company believes that we have a huge opportunity to support the new model of the NHS under the new Labour Administration.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK\u00a0law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley/Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc helps clinical teams to make better decisions faster for patients.

This further funding is for \u00a369,000 with an initial 50% paid from the NHSE H1 budget to 30 September 2024, with the balance expected from the NHSE H2 budget to continue the pilot to 31 March 2025. The pilot is focused on breathlessness, further demonstrating the impact of a pathway approach on CDC utilisation and wider patient wait times. The data generated will complement positive findings from past and ongoing pilots, building the business case for further expansion and funding.\nThe coverage of the NCA's Bleepa\u00ae based digital referral system, which is based on a separate Bleepa\u00ae contract with Feedback, has also been significantly expanded since December 2023, when it supported six specialities at Oldham and one at Fairfield General Hospital. Its total user number has increased 68% between June 2023 and June 2024 with over 1,400 users at the sites now generating over 9,200 patient referrals during this period alone. It now supports eleven specialties, including Endocrinology and Haematology at Oldham, and five specialities, including Cardiology and Respiratory at Fairfield.\nAn independent\nreport\nby Unity Insights published in October 2023 found that the NCA identified a dramatic reduction in clinical response times after switching to Bleepa\u00ae from paper-based referral systems, after examining 10,000 referrals made between July 2021 to April 2023. The report estimated that the collective time savings would be worth \u00a3819,000 to the NCA over 5 years and, if adopted across the whole Greater Manchester Integrated Care Board, could free up \u00a37.7m in savings over the same period.\nTom Oakley, CEO of Feedback plc, said:\n\"We are extremely pleased to announce the confirmation of the funded second stage of our CDC pilot at Oldham and remain focussed on delivering further evidence that supports the adoption of a pathway approach for CDCs, enabled by the Bleepa\u00ae platform. We see this as further validation of the value the NCA and NHSE sees in our service and will use our findings to support national expansion.\n\"As use of our digital inpatient referral system expands to cover more specialities, more users and capture more referrals at Oldham and Fairfield, we are eager to build upon the positive findings from Unity's report and deliver much needed time savings to the NHS.\"\nAnand Iyer, NCA CDC Programme Lead at the Northern Care Alliance said:\n\"We are thrilled to collaborate with Feedback to deliver a clinically transformative breathlessness pathway at the Oldham Community Diagnostic Centre. This new pathway enables patients to undergo multiple diagnostic tests in a single visit, with the Bleepa\u00ae system accelerating clinical response times. As a result, patients will experience significantly reduced waiting times and receive faster diagnoses.\"\nGeorges Ng Man Kwong, Chief Clinical Information Officer (Bury, Rochdale and Oldham) at the Northern Care Alliance, said:\n\"We are delighted that clinical engagement and onboarding of additional specialities in response to positive user feedback has led to ongoing systems optimisation, benefits realisation and value\u00a0for patients,\u00a0staff users, our care organisation and the wider NHS.'\"\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley/Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc liberates the data and knowledge from multiple healthcare IT systems and delivers better workflow to enable clinicians to communicate, collaborate and provide the best healthcare for their patients.

The Agreement enables the companies to work together and outlines the key terms which will form the basis of definitive commercial agreements for multiple collaborations.\nBroadened product functionality to strengthen global reach\nVertex is the UK registered reseller of the MedDream medical image viewer, an advanced diagnostics web viewer manufactured by UAB Softneta, which has existing regulatory approval (FDA Cleared and CE Marked) in a number of territories including the USA, Middle East and Europe.\nThe Agreement will enable Feedback to incorporate the MedDream viewer into Bleepa, enabling Bleepa to be sold directly to Radiologists for primary diagnostic reporting services, strengthening the Company's teleradiology offering and expanding the reach of the product to new territories such as the USA.\nEmbedding a viewer with existing regulatory approval in multiple international territories will enable the combined Bleepa/MedDream product to meet the regulatory requirements to be sold directly into these markets. Although the Company's primary international focus remains on its growing opportunity in India, this collaboration gives the Company the potential to expand into a number of key international territories as opportunities present themselves, most notably in the USA and Middle East.\nThe Agreement will position Feedback and Vertex to resell each other's products in multiple territories, allowing both entities to expand more rapidly and cost effectively into regions where the other has an existing footprint. Bleepa offers considerable value and product differentiation to Vertex's existing solutions in their current markets and will enable them to grow market share across multiple customer segments.\nOpportunity to drive revenues from Cadran\nAs part of the Agreement, Vertex will licence the database capabilities of Feedback's legacy picture archiving communication system Cadran PACS, now with the MedDream Viewer, which will allow it to build a PACS proposition that will initially be sold in South Africa and other international markets including the UK, where it sells PACS. This is another example of the Company's strategy to generate licencing royalties from its legacy products.\nThe Agreement covers a number of confidential commercial terms depending on the specific collaborative arrangement. Although no minimum targets are required, both companies are motivated to achieve high levels of commercialisation as a result of this Agreement.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO Feedback plc said:\n\"Vertex is a great partner for Feedback. Like us it is commercially minded, ambitious and on a clear mission to improve healthcare. Our products naturally fit together and create a compelling value proposition to customers, especially those who are increasingly looking for the most streamlined and cost-effective way of procuring the solutions that they need. Incorporating the MedDream viewer into Bleepa opens up new opportunities for us, both domestically to Radiologists and internationally, allowing us to expand more rapidly if we see opportunities overseas, avoiding some of the difficulties that we had in registering Bleepa as a medical device directly in India.\"\nChris Goldie, CEO of Vertex In Healthcare said:\n\"Bleepa is a fantastic tool that presents a real value add to our customers and will help us to differentiate ourselves in the market. The addition of Cadran PACS to our portfolio will allow us to offer a full product suite to customers, making us the go-to supplier for a complete hospital IT solutions. We are excited about the potential of this partnership and look forward to growing together.\"\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley/Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc helps clinical teams to make better decisions faster for patients.

The pilot has provided a substantial reduction in wait time compared to the national 18-week referral-to-treatment (RTT) target, without the need for additional clinical staff. This contract award provides the opportunity for Feedback to continue to deliver the core digital infrastructure required for the CDCs to reduce the elective care backlog and deliver a programme for the maximum benefit of staff, patients and the wider NHS. The success of Bleepa at QVH provides a valuable case study for the wider market across the UK.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO Feedback plc said:\n\"We are extremely pleased to announce that after two years of piloting our CDC solution with QVH we have been awarded a contract for the Bleepa platform. This contract will allow us to now expand the service offering to multiple GP practices and move beyond the breathlessness pathway to look at other specialty areas.\n\"This contract award is a compelling validation of our technology. QVH is an example that speaks to the rest of the NHS and is the pioneer of the symptom-based pathway on Bleepa, an approach which has demonstrated huge potential to cut wait times and improve care for patients. This contract will give others the confidence to progress with this care model and our platform, allowing us to now move forward to capture both the regional and national opportunity in front of us and ultimately to bring better, faster care to patients across the UK.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 as it forms part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n-Ends-\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Liberum Limited\n(NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley/Mark Rogers (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc helps clinical teams to make better decisions faster for patients.

The focus of this partnership is to develop and drive a digital model, that is able to scale at pace, and build the case for increasing the role of technology to deliver TB screening in India, which has a population of over one billion. This will likely initially be in the form of part-funded pilot studies, which the Company anticipates would cover its core project costs, to validate the digital model ahead of commercial contracts.\nFeedback is aiming to provide India with a digital first screening model that harnesses the speed and accuracy of X-ray imaging, supported by AI diagnostics. Effective screening requires asymptomatic cases in all areas of society, and we believe the only way to deliver this is via X-ray imaging performed right in the heart of the community.\nHEAL Foundation, as a non-governmental organisation (\"NGO\") will be the contracting entity with the donor organisations to receive funds. The partnership envisages that HEAL Foundation will provide project management and on-the-ground delivery of the TB screening projects - with Feedback, through its local subsidiary Feedback Medical India PVT Ltd, being the end-to-end technology partner (including selection and appointment of an AI provider, where appropriate) for TB screening and referral pathways.\nHEAL Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation registered under the Indian Trust Act. As a trust, it aims to engage key stakeholders of the healthcare industry in India.\nRohit Singh, Managing Director of Feedback Medical India PVT Ltd said:\n\"It is clear that TB screening needs a new model - and the only approach is a digitally enabled service, ideally with a digital front door and Bleepa is that enabler.\n\"We look forward to working with HEAL Foundation and in time believe we can adapt the screening model and together build a business case for increasing the role of technology\u00a0in future projects. It is essential that we can demonstrate the benefits around delivery and scalability in order to help donors understand that technology is a critical component for delivering social impact in this space.\n\"We are extremely excited by this partnership - with World TB Day yesterday, further raising public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic consequences of TB, we very much hope to be part of the solution in India.\"\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Gordon (UK) Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc helps clinical teams to make better decisions faster for patients.

This follows the two pilot sites,\nAmersham CDC in Buckinghamshire and a pan regional pilot across Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire ICS (\"BOB ICS\"),\nannounced on 19 December 2023. The Company has contracted directly with Oldham CDC using an additional award of funding locally disbursed for this purpose under NHS England's (\"NHSE\"), CDC Programme.\nThe contract entered into this week reflects advisory services Feedback has and continues to provide to Oldham CDC for the four-month period ended 31 March 2024 in relation to pathways development and deployment of the Company's market leading symptom-based pathway tool, Bleepa. On completion of the initial milestones, the Company will support Oldham CDC to apply for more funding from the 2024-25 NHS budget to extend the pilot with a view to installing Bleepa and establishing a live breathlessness pathway for patients. This will be used to complement findings from the ongoing pilots in Amersham CDC and BOB ICS, and follows the success of the ongoing pilot at\nQueen Victoria Hospital (\"QVH\") / Sussex Integrated Care System (\"Sussex ICS\") for the breathlessness pathway.\nThe Company continues to focus on providing reference points for commercial contracts and building the case for subsequent funding of a wider pathway approach to CDC delivery.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO of Feedback plc said\n:\n\"We are gaining momentum in the CDC space following the funding support released by NHSE. Each additional site builds the evidence base for wider rollout and helps convince the wider NHS of the unquestionable benefits of the symptom-based, straight-to-diagnostic pathway approach.\n\"A national conversation is growing around how CDCs can be used to drive down waitlists and demonstrates how the NHS can achieve a return on their capital investments to date in building CDCs. This is about leveraging the diagnostic outputs of the CDC to drive down waitlists by integrating them into patient pathways.\n\"\nWe are focused on further demonstrating the impact of a pathway approach on CDC utilisation and wider patient wait times - by providing multiple service lines and mutual aid delivery models for sharing workforce capacity at a regional basis through the Bleepa platform. We continue to have a number of discussions at the local, regional and national levels with NHS bodies and anticipate further updates in the coming months.\n\"Furthermore, we are encouraged by the increased NHS spending announced in the Spring Budget, highlighting the importance of investing in digital capabilities for the UK healthcare system. It is essential that the UK has a modern system that is able to provide timely care for patients - and we believe that Bleepa could have an integral role to play.\"\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Gordon (UK) Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc helps clinical teams to make better decisions faster for patients.

There is also a prevailing direction of travel, both in the UK and Internationally, that should see stricter data governance regulations imposed on the industry, which, the Board believes, will directly benefit Feedback, underpin demand for its products, and further differentiate it from competitors.\n\"The near-term outlook is promising. The implementation of the DPDP Act 23 in India and the ruling of the UK ICO against NHS Lanarkshire demonstrate that regulation and compliance are making a resurgence post COVID in both of our core markets. This, combined with the compelling evidence of clinical improvement that Bleepa delivers for its customers, has drawn increasing attention to Feedback and our products, culminating in our inclusion in the APPG for Diagnostics Report on CDCs and the award of central NHS funding to expand our pilot programme. The Board expects continued focus and investment in the CDC programme and cross-provider pathways in H2 and the upcoming financial year as the NHS continues its efforts to address the growing care backlog. We believe that Bleepa is optimally positioned to capture this opportunity and deliver meaningful system impact and commercial opportunities as a result.\"\nNote (1): \"Sales\" is non-IFRS me",

The pilot will formally commence on a paid basis after an initial evaluation and planning period. It is anticipated that Bleepa will host a number of different diagnostic-led clinical pathways, starting initially with a novel direct access prostate screening service, pioneered by MIP, with further pathways across cardiac and Women's Health services to be onboarded later in the year.\nBleepa-CareLocker has been selected by MIP as its preferred digital partner based on its requirements to view clinical results data securely and remotely, to conduct asynchronous remote multidisciplinary team (\"MDTs\") meetings and to communicate results across provider sites, all through a single platform. It is anticipated that the pilot will also evaluate the possibility of patient direct access to results through Feedback's CareLocker application.\nPatient volumes and associated revenue are expected to be modest in the early stages, post the evaluation and planning phase, however, management believes that the importance of this pilot cannot be understated. The fact that this is a direct translation of the NHS pathway work into the UK private healthcare sector highlights the important role that the private sector can play in supporting the NHS recovery and those patients affected by long waiting lists. It also demonstrates the huge versatility of the Bleepa-CareLocker platform to deliver care across sectors and is Feedback's first step towards opening a business line in the UK private sector.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO Feedback plc said:\n\"This exciting programme is the culmination of years of pathway work alongside UK clinicians. In Bleepa-CareLocker, we have developed a platform that delivers an unparalleled value proposition to clinical service partners, both in the NHS and now in the private sector. This is the first time that we have translated our NHS model into the private sector and we are excited to see the impact this could have for private patients and MIP as our clinical service partner and customer. We hope to use this pilot to open our opportunity in the UK private healthcare market, which was expected to reach \u00a311 billion in 2023.\"\nSteve Bird, CEO of Medical Imaging Partners said:\n\"MIP is developing new models of diagnostic services in the independent diagnostic sector, including expanding its range of cancer and cardiac health checks and diagnostic tests. The company is also delivering a compelling range of direct-to-consumer diagnostic services that can offer patients choice and fast access at crucial times in their health and wellness journey. We see Bleepa-CareLocker as the ideal platform for us to help support these services and we were impressed by the capabilities and impact delivered in the NHS CDC pilots undertaken recently and look forward to seeing how this platform can help us to deliver our own pathways in the independent sector.\"\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Gordon (UK) Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc helps clinical teams to make better decisions faster for patients.

This is primarily due to the prior period being positively impacted by the QVH/Sussex ICS pilot contract, which was signed in September 2022 but covered the 12-month period from 31 March 2022, and, the planned ongoing decline in legacy product revenues as these legacy contracts reach the end of term. Management expects Bleepa-CareLocker solutions to drive revenue growth going forward as the Company continues to demonstrate the technical improvements, time, and efficiency savings that its products can provide to customer sites.\nCash and cash equivalents as at 30 November 2023 were \u00a3\n5.37\nm (30 November 2022: \u00a39.23m).\nOperational Highlights & Current Trading\nCommunity Diagnostics Centre\ns\nAs announced today, the Company is conducting a series of pilot programmes of Community Diagnostic Centre (\"CDC\") care pathways funded by a combined award of \u00a3300,000. The Company has directly contracted with the individual NHS organisations hosting the pilot sites utilising funds locally disbursed for this purpose under NHS England's (\"NHSE\"), Community Diagnostic Centre Programme.\nThe pilot contract awards follow the successful CDC pilot at\nQueen Victoria Hospital (\"QVH\") and seeks to replicate the positive impact data seen; reinforcing the case for subsequent funding of a pathway approach to UK CDC delivery in subsequent years, which are central to Government ambitions to cut NHS wait times.\nThe Pilot sites are Amersham CDC (\"Amersham\") in Buckinghamshire and a pan regional pilot across Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire ICS (\"BOB ICS\").\nFeedback has also secured a second, paid extension to its contract with\nQVH worth \u00a3225k for a further\nsix-months to 30 June 2024\n. Further to previous announcements, the Trust launched a replacement procurement process in November 2023 which is expected to complete by March 2024. Feedback is participating in\nt\nhis replacement procurement process, which follows\nthe abandonment of the Trust's previous procurement (as per the announcement dated 04 April 2023).\nNorthern Care Alliance\nThe Company also continues to demonstrate the benefits of Bleepa in the NHS beyond the CDC setting. In October, an independent study found the Northern Care Alliance cut its inpatient referral times by three quarters using Bleepa to manage its inpatient referrals. The review estimates that the collective time savings could free up \u00a37.7 million over the next five years if adopted across the whole Greater Manchester ICB footprint.\nIndia\nThe Board remains confident in the long-term prospects of the Indian market, which offers significant scale. In the Period, the Company was successfully granted an import license for Bleepa as a registered medical device in India and its new in-country Managing Director, Rohit Singh, continues to explore potential market opportunities with various government organisations and large hospital chains.\nBleepa\nThe latest version of Bleepa, v1.6, is currently undergoing final testing prior to release. Key additional features include a dashboard view of patient pathways to assist with pathway coordination and administration, giving customers the ability to track their patients' progress across care settings; improvements to message directionalising within chat and the ability to generate urgent messages to highlight key clinical insights. This version will be rolled out to customers in the new year and is anticipated to greatly improve the value proposition to NHS customers in particular as we look to growing sales in H2.\nOutlook\nThe Company has performed well during an extremely challenging trading environment; large amounts of NHS digitisation funding has been pulled to meet the increased salary packages awarded to frontline clinicians following the strikes, which has placed a number of digital projects in jeopardy across the system. However, we have seen continued focus on the CDC programme, which remains a key area of strategic investment for the NHS and has led to the recent award of funding to expand the Bleepa-CareLocker pilot programme around pathway enablement. Bleepa-CareLocker has been recognised as having the potential to supercharge the CDC initiative, helping to leverage the diagnostic capacity generated by the CDCs to drive clinical pathways and reduce waitlists. The additional pilot funding and the continued investment by the NHS in the CDC programme, gives the Board confidence that Feedback is well aligned to the key areas of NHS strategic priority and will therefore be less affected by the wider redirection of digital funding.\nDuring the Period the sales team was expanded, ",

GP Connect ( Bleepa being one of the first partners integrated into the new NHS  GP Connect - so now any GP practice can be added across the UK). or, The New Partner ( not named) - Elective Recovery Opportunity - they stated  in Q&A  will update as progress, have potential customers already ! AWS interested in UK Opportunity, apparently They have a near term opportunity according to presentation with a Private Care Provider ( could be one of the larger ones) Positive news from QVH who are continuing to trial ( paid for by NHS)  and create multiple new pathways = BIG Pilot, could lead to larger contract than just one individual hospital. News from Vertex in South Africa or middle East who are now using Bleepa as an add on to their own products - so customers already on board Tom did state that  BLEEPA was in fact CHOSEN as a Digital solution ready for National Rollout by the ERS funding mechanism , but this opportunity disappeared due to the  elections ...see RNS , shares doubled shortly after....so IMO it sound like FDBK had this opportunity in the bag, and it was lost due to the elections - so this is their second attempt, but with a years behind the scenes progress . As far as the spending review funding Tom did state it could be available anytime up until beginning of next tax year - April 26   - so a small chance of earlier news. Plus someone seems to buying the shares in numbers. So , i thought i would start to add again as the sp has dropped considerably and 12 weeks is nothing compared to some of the timelines i have had to wait with other shares.  GL Vas",

However, on 10th Nov. 25 Dr Rory James SHAW was appointed as Director, the same person who resigned from FDBK medical in 2018! So why appoint a previous director to a sleeping subsidiary ? This is where it gets even more interesting which leads me to think something is likely to happen sooner rather than later. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12118570/officers It looks as if Feedback Medical have another subsiduary called Brickshield Ltd, a dormant company with Tom Oakley made as Director in April 23.  But again, Dr Rory James Shaw, ex director of FDBK  was made Director on the same date, as Bleepa Ltd above on the 10th Nov 25. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06514313/officers Just for clarity these appointments in the FDBK subsidiaries have both been made after the September 25 investor presentations\u2026.something occurring!

Interesting times for sure and maybe, just maybe, we will see contract details in the not too distant future. My major concern now is competition. Whilst claims made by TO would suggest that there is no competitive offering likely to replace Bleepa in those NHS solution areas for which we are bidding, the slow pace of decision making has given competition time to develop and promote an alternative. In particular, I am concerned about the Chinese who are particularly adept at copying IP and positioning cheaper alternatives. The UK Govt and Whitehall, are, unfortunately, prone to adopting Chinese solutions no matter how risky from a security standpoint. I would imagine the Chinese would love to infiltrate the NHS",

          "content": "So I cut and paste your post into Gemini AI: This is a sophisticated observation of corporate maneuvering, and the timing of these appointments\u2014specifically November 10, 2025\u2014is highly suggestive of a strategic shift at Feedback PLC (FDBK). When a dormant or \"sleeping\" subsidiary suddenly has a seasoned former director appointed alongside the current CEO, it typically points to one of three corporate actions: a divestment/spin-off, a joint venture, or a ring-fencing of specific intellectual property (IP). Here is an analysis of why Dr. Rory Shaw\u2019s return to these specific entities is significant: 1. The \"Clean Break\" or Spin-Off Theory Dr. Rory Shaw was the Medical Director of Feedback PLC during its earlier growth phase (resigning in 2018). His reappointment to Bleepa Ltd and Brickshield Ltd on the same day that the group's CFO (Anesh Patel) officially stepped down (Nov 10, 2025) suggests a coordinated reshuffle. * Why Rory Shaw? He has \"legacy\" credibility. If Feedback is looking to sell off or spin out the Bleepa platform as a standalone entity to a private equity firm or a larger health-tech player, having a veteran clinical leader like Shaw on the subsidiary board provides stability and continuity that a \"new\" hire wouldn't offer. * The \"Brickshield\" Mystery: Brickshield has historically been a dormant vehicle. Its reactivation suggests it may be used to house a specific piece of IP or a new contract that the parent company wants to keep legally separate from the main PLC balance sheet\u2014potentially to make it \"deal-ready.\" 2. Strategic \"Ring-Fencing\" for Funding Feedback's recent 2025 presentations emphasized a \"digital-first\" NHS and the expansion of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs). * By activating Bleepa Ltd (the namesake of their flagship product) as a functional subsidiary rather than just a brand name within \"Feedback Medical Ltd,\" they may be preparing to take on project-specific investment. * If a partner (like a Tier 1 medical imaging company) wanted to invest specifically in the Bleepa technology without buying into the entire PLC, appointing Shaw\u2014who understands the clinical architecture\u2014would be a move to satisfy due diligence requirements. 3. The Takeover Protection & Valuation Angle As of November 2025, Feedback PLC confirmed it is subject to the UK Takeover Code. When a company is \"in play\" or expecting an approach: * They often tidy up their corporate structure. * Moving key assets (like the Bleepa trademark and operations) into a dedicated subsidiary like Bleepa Ltd makes the company easier to value for a potential suitor. * Shaw\u2019s appointment could be as a \"Safe Pair of Hands\" to oversee this transition, allowing CEO Tom Oakley to focus on the high-level PLC management and investor relations during a sale process. Why the 10th of November is the \"Smoking Gun\" The fact that these appointments happened on the exact day the new CFO (Emma Oswick) took over and the old CFO departed is n",

It marks the start of a \"New Era\" for the company. \u200bSummary of the likely \"Something Occurring\": \u200bBleepa Ltd: Likely becoming the primary operational vehicle for the Bleepa platform, possibly to prepare for a sale or separate funding round. \u200bBrickshield Ltd: Likely being repurposed to hold \"Shield\" or security-related IP, or perhaps a specific NHS contract that requires a clean corporate vehicle. \u200bDr. Rory Shaw: His return is a signal of Clinical Governance. It tells the market (and potential buyers) that the medical integrity of the platform is being overseen by someone who helped build the company's foundation. \u200bConclusion: You are likely correct that \"something is occurring.\" The activation of dormant subsidiaries following a period of poor share price performance and a CFO change is a classic precursor to a structural reorganization or a formal sale process. Take from the above what you will but changes seem to be round the corner. Gla and well done/thank you Vas for your research",

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

TPP was the first supplier to achieve a full national rollout for some GP Connect capabilities. Medicus Health: A smaller, newer provider that has also achieved full rollout approval for several GP Connect services.

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

This was discussed at the Sept 25 Q&A\u2026..It could be used as a  blueprint for  national rollout possibly,  but NHS wanted more connections and pathways .

At least he\u2019s trying, I\u2019m just not sure how successful he really is at increasing interest in Bleepa. But let\u2019s admit it: this is about as close as a small private company CEO can realistically get to policy-makers. If Bleepa turns out not to be the game-changer some expect, then the last remaining lever would be to hire a major lobbying firm which is obviously far beyond the reach of a company this size. So, for better or worse, this is pretty much the maximum level of influence Feedback can realistically afford.",

          "content": "Hi Private, I cut my holding by half at last presentation and will add probably quite soon. The reason being that i am hoping we receive earlier news regarding other opportunities mentioned in the investor presentation , while we await the decision from the NHS regarding the Elective Recovery Funding,  with Bleepa being the only serious contender and already integrated in the NHS systems and completed trials etc, i think we stand a good chance of being funding for a national rollout. also sometime soon i get the feeling form the presentation that they hope to release some earlier news such as ... GP Connect ( Bleepa being one of the first partners integrated into the new NHS  GP Connect - so now any GP practice can be added across the UK). or, The New Partner ( not named) - Elective Recovery Opportunity - they stated  in Q&A  will update as progress, have potential customers already ! AWS interested in UK Opportunity, apparently They have a near term opportunity according to presentation with a Private Care Provider ( could be one of the larger ones) Positive news from QVH who are continuing to trial ( paid for by NHS)  and create multiple new pathways = BIG Pilot, could lead to larger contract than just one individual hospital. News from Vertex in South Africa or middle East who are now using Bleepa as an add on to their own products - so customers already on board Tom did state that  BLEEPA was in fact CHOSEN as a Digital solution ready for National Rollout by the ERS funding mechanism , but this opportunity disappeared due to the  elections ...see RNS , shares doubled shortly after....so IMO it sound like FDBK had this opportunity in the bag, and it was lost due to the elections - so this is their second attempt, but with a years behind the scenes progress . As far as the spending review funding Tom did state it could be available anytime up until beginning of next tax year - April 26   - so a small chance of earlier news. Plus someone seems to buying the shares in numbers. So , i thought i would start to add again as the sp has dropped considerably and 12 weeks is nothing compared to some of the timelines i have had to wait with other shares.  GL Vas",

This is where it gets even more interesting which leads me to think something is likely to happen sooner rather than later. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12118570/officers It looks as if Feedback Medical have another subsiduary called Brickshield Ltd, a dormant company with Tom Oakley made as Director in April 23.

Interesting times for sure and maybe, just maybe, we will see contract details in the not too distant future. My major concern now is competition. Whilst claims made by TO would suggest that there is no competitive offering likely to replace Bleepa in those NHS solution areas for which we are bidding, the slow pace of decision making has given competition time to develop and promote an alternative. In particular, I am concerned about the Chinese who are particularly adept at copying IP and positioning cheaper alternatives. The UK Govt and Whitehall, are, unfortunately, prone to adopting Chinese solutions no matter how risky from a security standpoint. I would imagine the Chinese would love to infiltrate the NHS",

          "content": "So I cut and paste your post into Gemini AI: This is a sophisticated observation of corporate maneuvering, and the timing of these appointments\u2014specifically November 10, 2025\u2014is highly suggestive of a strategic shift at Feedback PLC (FDBK). When a dormant or \"sleeping\" subsidiary suddenly has a seasoned former director appointed alongside the current CEO, it typically points to one of three corporate actions: a divestment/spin-off, a joint venture, or a ring-fencing of specific intellectual property (IP). Here is an analysis of why Dr. Rory Shaw\u2019s return to these specific entities is significant: 1. The \"Clean Break\" or Spin-Off Theory Dr. Rory Shaw was the Medical Director of Feedback PLC during its earlier growth phase (resigning in 2018). His reappointment to Bleepa Ltd and Brickshield Ltd on the same day that the group's CFO (Anesh Patel) officially stepped down (Nov 10, 2025) suggests a coordinated reshuffle. * Why Rory Shaw? He has \"legacy\" credibility. If Feedback is looking to sell off or spin out the Bleepa platform as a standalone entity to a private equity firm or a larger health-tech player, having a veteran clinical leader like Shaw on the subsidiary board provides stability and continuity that a \"new\" hire wouldn't offer. * The \"Brickshield\" Mystery: Brickshield has historically been a dormant vehicle. Its reactivation suggests it may be used to house a specific piece of IP or a new contract that the parent company wants to keep legally separate from the main PLC balance sheet\u2014potentially to make it \"deal-ready.\" 2. Strategic \"Ring-Fencing\" for Funding Feedback's recent 2025 presentations emphasized a \"digital-first\" NHS and the expansion of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs). * By activating Bleepa Ltd (the namesake of their flagship product) as a functional subsidiary rather than just a brand name within \"Feedback Medical Ltd,\" they may be preparing to take on project-specific investment. * If a partner (like a Tier 1 medical imaging company) wanted to invest specifically in the Bleepa technology without buying into the entire PLC, appointing Shaw\u2014who understands the clinical architecture\u2014would be a move to satisfy due diligence requirements. 3. The Takeover Protection & Valuation Angle As of November 2025, Feedback PLC confirmed it is subject to the UK Takeover Code. When a company is \"in play\" or expecting an approach: * They often tidy up their corporate structure. * Moving key assets (like the Bleepa trademark and operations) into a dedicated subsidiary like Bleepa Ltd makes the company easier to value for a potential suitor. * Shaw\u2019s appointment could be as a \"Safe Pair of Hands\" to oversee this transition, allowing CEO Tom Oakley to focus on the high-level PLC management and investor relations during a sale process. Why the 10th of November is the \"Smoking Gun\" The fact that these appointments happened on the exact day the new CFO (Emma Oswick) took over and the old CFO departed is n",

It marks the start of a \"New Era\" for the company. \u200bSummary of the likely \"Something Occurring\": \u200bBleepa Ltd: Likely becoming the primary operational vehicle for the Bleepa platform, possibly to prepare for a sale or separate funding round. \u200bBrickshield Ltd: Likely being repurposed to hold \"Shield\" or security-related IP, or perhaps a specific NHS contract that requires a clean corporate vehicle. \u200bDr. Rory Shaw: His return is a signal of Clinical Governance. It tells the market (and potential buyers) that the medical integrity of the platform is being overseen by someone who helped build the company's foundation. \u200bConclusion: You are likely correct that \"something is occurring.\" The activation of dormant subsidiaries following a period of poor share price performance and a CFO change is a classic precursor to a structural reorganization or a formal sale process.

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

As posted before the other three are TPP, FoT  and  Medicus , as far as i can see.

TPP was the first supplier to achieve a full national rollout for some GP Connect capabilities. Medicus Health: A smaller, newer provider that has also achieved full rollout approval for several GP Connect services.

Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

This sector ( GP Connect) is heating up, and is a small, niche area, with limited competition imo.  the value in Optum is the recently ( 18 months ago)  bought company EMIS that is only one of only four company's in UK NHS  that  provides the software for , and link up GP Connect.   As posted before the other three are TPP, FoT  and  Medicus , as far as i can see. We know FDBK are working with Optum and if this deal does go through , and Optum is sold to TPG -  this could open up doors in USA one day. TPG could get access to both GP Connect and possibly neighbourhood Health services in UK. Things seem to be moving along faster these days.....",

It is a robust clinical record system integrated with the GP Connect APIs. TPP SystmOne: Used by most of the remaining practices, it has a single central record store across all GPs using the system. TPP was the first supplier to achieve a full national rollout for some GP Connect capabilities. Medicus Health: A smaller, newer provider that has also achieved full rollout approval for several GP Connect services. If in the future FDBK do win to supply nationally, then any early work , trials with Optum would mean thatFDBK would also need to be included in the other providers such as TPP, I guess.",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

The key phrase imo is\u2026 \u201c Hospitals across Sussex are preparing for a major digital upgrade designed to improve patient safety and provide more joined-up care. University Hospitals Sussex (UHSussex) has selected a supplier to deliver a new electronic patient record (EPR) system across all of its hospitals, marking a key milestone in the Trust\u2019s long-term Excellent Care Everywhere strategy.\u201d Note\u2026.\u201c to deliver a EPR system across All of its hospitals\u201d As we know QVH  along with FDBK medical is continuing their work and extending the Bleepa reach and pathway's to community and other hospitals, possibly.  This was discussed at the Sept 25 Q&A\u2026..It could be used as a  blueprint for  national rollout possibly,  but NHS wanted more connections and pathways . The seven NHS provider partners in the Sussex Health and Care system are: University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Hard to imagine that FDBK not involved at some point. Providers can use more than one EPR as long as they are interoperable\u2026FDBK will hopefully provide the glue to allow them to securely communicate with each other. https://www.sussex.ics.nhs.uk/about-sussex-health-and-care/who-we-are/ Alcidion is the EPR company that has been selected as preferred EPR supplier by University Hospitals Sussex https://hospitaltimes.co.uk/alcidion-selected-as-preferred-epr-supplier-by-university-hospitals-sussex/",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

The key phrase imo is\u2026 \u201c Hospitals across Sussex are preparing for a major digital upgrade designed to improve patient safety and provide more joined-up care. University Hospitals Sussex (UHSussex) has selected a supplier to deliver a new electronic patient record (EPR) system across all of its hospitals, marking a key milestone in the Trust\u2019s long-term Excellent Care Everywhere strategy.\u201d Note\u2026.\u201c to deliver a EPR system across All of its hospitals\u201d As we know QVH  along with FDBK medical is continuing their work and extending the Bleepa reach and pathway's to community and other hospitals, possibly.  This was discussed at the Sept 25 Q&A\u2026..It could be used as a  blueprint for  national rollout possibly,  but NHS wanted more connections and pathways . The seven NHS provider partners in the Sussex Health and Care system are: University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Hard to imagine that FDBK not involved at some point. Providers can use more than one EPR as long as they are interoperable\u2026FDBK will hopefully provide the glue to allow them to securely communicate with each other. https://www.sussex.ics.nhs.uk/about-sussex-health-and-care/who-we-are/ Alcidion is the EPR company that has been selected as preferred EPR supplier by University Hospitals Sussex https://hospitaltimes.co.uk/alcidion-selected-as-preferred-epr-supplier-by-university-hospitals-sussex/",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

It marks the start of a \"New Era\" for the company. \u200bSummary of the likely \"Something Occurring\": \u200bBleepa Ltd: Likely becoming the primary operational vehicle for the Bleepa platform, possibly to prepare for a sale or separate funding round. \u200bBrickshield Ltd: Likely being repurposed to hold \"Shield\" or security-related IP, or perhaps a specific NHS contract that requires a clean corporate vehicle. \u200bDr. Rory Shaw: His return is a signal of Clinical Governance. It tells the market (and potential buyers) that the medical integrity of the platform is being overseen by someone who helped build the company's foundation. \u200bConclusion: You are likely correct that \"something is occurring.\" The activation of dormant subsidiaries following a period of poor share price performance and a CFO change is a classic precursor to a structural reorganization or a formal sale process.

          "content": "So I cut and paste your post into Gemini AI: This is a sophisticated observation of corporate maneuvering, and the timing of these appointments\u2014specifically November 10, 2025\u2014is highly suggestive of a strategic shift at Feedback PLC (FDBK). When a dormant or \"sleeping\" subsidiary suddenly has a seasoned former director appointed alongside the current CEO, it typically points to one of three corporate actions: a divestment/spin-off, a joint venture, or a ring-fencing of specific intellectual property (IP). Here is an analysis of why Dr. Rory Shaw\u2019s return to these specific entities is significant: 1. The \"Clean Break\" or Spin-Off Theory Dr. Rory Shaw was the Medical Director of Feedback PLC during its earlier growth phase (resigning in 2018). His reappointment to Bleepa Ltd and Brickshield Ltd on the same day that the group's CFO (Anesh Patel) officially stepped down (Nov 10, 2025) suggests a coordinated reshuffle. * Why Rory Shaw? He has \"legacy\" credibility. If Feedback is looking to sell off or spin out the Bleepa platform as a standalone entity to a private equity firm or a larger health-tech player, having a veteran clinical leader like Shaw on the subsidiary board provides stability and continuity that a \"new\" hire wouldn't offer. * The \"Brickshield\" Mystery: Brickshield has historically been a dormant vehicle. Its reactivation suggests it may be used to house a specific piece of IP or a new contract that the parent company wants to keep legally separate from the main PLC balance sheet\u2014potentially to make it \"deal-ready.\" 2. Strategic \"Ring-Fencing\" for Funding Feedback's recent 2025 presentations emphasized a \"digital-first\" NHS and the expansion of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs). * By activating Bleepa Ltd (the namesake of their flagship product) as a functional subsidiary rather than just a brand name within \"Feedback Medical Ltd,\" they may be preparing to take on project-specific investment. * If a partner (like a Tier 1 medical imaging company) wanted to invest specifically in the Bleepa technology without buying into the entire PLC, appointing Shaw\u2014who understands the clinical architecture\u2014would be a move to satisfy due diligence requirements. 3. The Takeover Protection & Valuation Angle As of November 2025, Feedback PLC confirmed it is subject to the UK Takeover Code. When a company is \"in play\" or expecting an approach: * They often tidy up their corporate structure. * Moving key assets (like the Bleepa trademark and operations) into a dedicated subsidiary like Bleepa Ltd makes the company easier to value for a potential suitor. * Shaw\u2019s appointment could be as a \"Safe Pair of Hands\" to oversee this transition, allowing CEO Tom Oakley to focus on the high-level PLC management and investor relations during a sale process. Why the 10th of November is the \"Smoking Gun\" The fact that these appointments happened on the exact day the new CFO (Emma Oswick) took over and the old CFO departed is n",

Interesting times for sure and maybe, just maybe, we will see contract details in the not too distant future. My major concern now is competition. Whilst claims made by TO would suggest that there is no competitive offering likely to replace Bleepa in those NHS solution areas for which we are bidding, the slow pace of decision making has given competition time to develop and promote an alternative. In particular, I am concerned about the Chinese who are particularly adept at copying IP and positioning cheaper alternatives. The UK Govt and Whitehall, are, unfortunately, prone to adopting Chinese solutions no matter how risky from a security standpoint. I would imagine the Chinese would love to infiltrate the NHS",

          "content": "Hi Private, I cut my holding by half at last presentation and will add probably quite soon. The reason being that i am hoping we receive earlier news regarding other opportunities mentioned in the investor presentation , while we await the decision from the NHS regarding the Elective Recovery Funding,  with Bleepa being the only serious contender and already integrated in the NHS systems and completed trials etc, i think we stand a good chance of being funding for a national rollout. also sometime soon i get the feeling form the presentation that they hope to release some earlier news such as ... GP Connect ( Bleepa being one of the first partners integrated into the new NHS  GP Connect - so now any GP practice can be added across the UK). or, The New Partner ( not named) - Elective Recovery Opportunity - they stated  in Q&A  will update as progress, have potential customers already ! AWS interested in UK Opportunity, apparently They have a near term opportunity according to presentation with a Private Care Provider ( could be one of the larger ones) Positive news from QVH who are continuing to trial ( paid for by NHS)  and create multiple new pathways = BIG Pilot, could lead to larger contract than just one individual hospital. News from Vertex in South Africa or middle East who are now using Bleepa as an add on to their own products - so customers already on board Tom did state that  BLEEPA was in fact CHOSEN as a Digital solution ready for National Rollout by the ERS funding mechanism , but this opportunity disappeared due to the  elections ...see RNS , shares doubled shortly after....so IMO it sound like FDBK had this opportunity in the bag, and it was lost due to the elections - so this is their second attempt, but with a years behind the scenes progress . As far as the spending review funding Tom did state it could be available anytime up until beginning of next tax year - April 26   - so a small chance of earlier news. Plus someone seems to buying the shares in numbers. So , i thought i would start to add again as the sp has dropped considerably and 12 weeks is nothing compared to some of the timelines i have had to wait with other shares.  GL Vas",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

This sector ( GP Connect) is heating up, and is a small, niche area, with limited competition imo.  the value in Optum is the recently ( 18 months ago)  bought company EMIS that is only one of only four company's in UK NHS  that  provides the software for , and link up GP Connect.   As posted before the other three are TPP, FoT  and  Medicus , as far as i can see. We know FDBK are working with Optum and if this deal does go through , and Optum is sold to TPG -  this could open up doors in USA one day. TPG could get access to both GP Connect and possibly neighbourhood Health services in UK. Things seem to be moving along faster these days.....",

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

          "content": "So I cut and paste your post into Gemini AI: This is a sophisticated observation of corporate maneuvering, and the timing of these appointments\u2014specifically November 10, 2025\u2014is highly suggestive of a strategic shift at Feedback PLC (FDBK). When a dormant or \"sleeping\" subsidiary suddenly has a seasoned former director appointed alongside the current CEO, it typically points to one of three corporate actions: a divestment/spin-off, a joint venture, or a ring-fencing of specific intellectual property (IP). Here is an analysis of why Dr. Rory Shaw\u2019s return to these specific entities is significant: 1. The \"Clean Break\" or Spin-Off Theory Dr. Rory Shaw was the Medical Director of Feedback PLC during its earlier growth phase (resigning in 2018). His reappointment to Bleepa Ltd and Brickshield Ltd on the same day that the group's CFO (Anesh Patel) officially stepped down (Nov 10, 2025) suggests a coordinated reshuffle. * Why Rory Shaw? He has \"legacy\" credibility. If Feedback is looking to sell off or spin out the Bleepa platform as a standalone entity to a private equity firm or a larger health-tech player, having a veteran clinical leader like Shaw on the subsidiary board provides stability and continuity that a \"new\" hire wouldn't offer. * The \"Brickshield\" Mystery: Brickshield has historically been a dormant vehicle. Its reactivation suggests it may be used to house a specific piece of IP or a new contract that the parent company wants to keep legally separate from the main PLC balance sheet\u2014potentially to make it \"deal-ready.\" 2. Strategic \"Ring-Fencing\" for Funding Feedback's recent 2025 presentations emphasized a \"digital-first\" NHS and the expansion of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs). * By activating Bleepa Ltd (the namesake of their flagship product) as a functional subsidiary rather than just a brand name within \"Feedback Medical Ltd,\" they may be preparing to take on project-specific investment. * If a partner (like a Tier 1 medical imaging company) wanted to invest specifically in the Bleepa technology without buying into the entire PLC, appointing Shaw\u2014who understands the clinical architecture\u2014would be a move to satisfy due diligence requirements. 3. The Takeover Protection & Valuation Angle As of November 2025, Feedback PLC confirmed it is subject to the UK Takeover Code. When a company is \"in play\" or expecting an approach: * They often tidy up their corporate structure. * Moving key assets (like the Bleepa trademark and operations) into a dedicated subsidiary like Bleepa Ltd makes the company easier to value for a potential suitor. * Shaw\u2019s appointment could be as a \"Safe Pair of Hands\" to oversee this transition, allowing CEO Tom Oakley to focus on the high-level PLC management and investor relations during a sale process. Why the 10th of November is the \"Smoking Gun\" The fact that these appointments happened on the exact day the new CFO (Emma Oswick) took over and the old CFO departed is n",

Interesting times for sure and maybe, just maybe, we will see contract details in the not too distant future. My major concern now is competition. Whilst claims made by TO would suggest that there is no competitive offering likely to replace Bleepa in those NHS solution areas for which we are bidding, the slow pace of decision making has given competition time to develop and promote an alternative. In particular, I am concerned about the Chinese who are particularly adept at copying IP and positioning cheaper alternatives. The UK Govt and Whitehall, are, unfortunately, prone to adopting Chinese solutions no matter how risky from a security standpoint. I would imagine the Chinese would love to infiltrate the NHS",

Bleepa, for example, is a mobile radiology solution on AWS that allows clinicians to review imaging investigations, such as CT and MRI scans, on their mobile device and receive advice from a radiologist wherever they are.

          "content": "Hi Private, I cut my holding by half at last presentation and will add probably quite soon. The reason being that i am hoping we receive earlier news regarding other opportunities mentioned in the investor presentation , while we await the decision from the NHS regarding the Elective Recovery Funding,  with Bleepa being the only serious contender and already integrated in the NHS systems and completed trials etc, i think we stand a good chance of being funding for a national rollout. also sometime soon i get the feeling form the presentation that they hope to release some earlier news such as ... GP Connect ( Bleepa being one of the first partners integrated into the new NHS  GP Connect - so now any GP practice can be added across the UK). or, The New Partner ( not named) - Elective Recovery Opportunity - they stated  in Q&A  will update as progress, have potential customers already ! AWS interested in UK Opportunity, apparently They have a near term opportunity according to presentation with a Private Care Provider ( could be one of the larger ones) Positive news from QVH who are continuing to trial ( paid for by NHS)  and create multiple new pathways = BIG Pilot, could lead to larger contract than just one individual hospital. News from Vertex in South Africa or middle East who are now using Bleepa as an add on to their own products - so customers already on board Tom did state that  BLEEPA was in fact CHOSEN as a Digital solution ready for National Rollout by the ERS funding mechanism , but this opportunity disappeared due to the  elections ...see RNS , shares doubled shortly after....so IMO it sound like FDBK had this opportunity in the bag, and it was lost due to the elections - so this is their second attempt, but with a years behind the scenes progress . As far as the spending review funding Tom did state it could be available anytime up until beginning of next tax year - April 26   - so a small chance of earlier news. Plus someone seems to buying the shares in numbers. So , i thought i would start to add again as the sp has dropped considerably and 12 weeks is nothing compared to some of the timelines i have had to wait with other shares.  GL Vas",

The key phrase imo is\u2026 \u201c Hospitals across Sussex are preparing for a major digital upgrade designed to improve patient safety and provide more joined-up care. University Hospitals Sussex (UHSussex) has selected a supplier to deliver a new electronic patient record (EPR) system across all of its hospitals, marking a key milestone in the Trust\u2019s long-term Excellent Care Everywhere strategy.\u201d Note\u2026.\u201c to deliver a EPR system across All of its hospitals\u201d As we know QVH  along with FDBK medical is continuing their work and extending the Bleepa reach and pathway's to community and other hospitals, possibly.  This was discussed at the Sept 25 Q&A\u2026..It could be used as a  blueprint for  national rollout possibly,  but NHS wanted more connections and pathways . The seven NHS provider partners in the Sussex Health and Care system are: University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Hard to imagine that FDBK not involved at some point. Providers can use more than one EPR as long as they are interoperable\u2026FDBK will hopefully provide the glue to allow them to securely communicate with each other. https://www.sussex.ics.nhs.uk/about-sussex-health-and-care/who-we-are/ Alcidion is the EPR company that has been selected as preferred EPR supplier by University Hospitals Sussex https://hospitaltimes.co.uk/alcidion-selected-as-preferred-epr-supplier-by-university-hospitals-sussex/",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

It is a robust clinical record system integrated with the GP Connect APIs. TPP SystmOne: Used by most of the remaining practices, it has a single central record store across all GPs using the system. TPP was the first supplier to achieve a full national rollout for some GP Connect capabilities. Medicus Health: A smaller, newer provider that has also achieved full rollout approval for several GP Connect services. If in the future FDBK do win to supply nationally, then any early work , trials with Optum would mean thatFDBK would also need to be included in the other providers such as TPP, I guess.",

This sector ( GP Connect) is heating up, and is a small, niche area, with limited competition imo.  the value in Optum is the recently ( 18 months ago)  bought company EMIS that is only one of only four company's in UK NHS  that  provides the software for , and link up GP Connect.   As posted before the other three are TPP, FoT  and  Medicus , as far as i can see. We know FDBK are working with Optum and if this deal does go through , and Optum is sold to TPG -  this could open up doors in USA one day. TPG could get access to both GP Connect and possibly neighbourhood Health services in UK. Things seem to be moving along faster these days.....",

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

          "content": "So I cut and paste your post into Gemini AI: This is a sophisticated observation of corporate maneuvering, and the timing of these appointments\u2014specifically November 10, 2025\u2014is highly suggestive of a strategic shift at Feedback PLC (FDBK). When a dormant or \"sleeping\" subsidiary suddenly has a seasoned former director appointed alongside the current CEO, it typically points to one of three corporate actions: a divestment/spin-off, a joint venture, or a ring-fencing of specific intellectual property (IP). Here is an analysis of why Dr. Rory Shaw\u2019s return to these specific entities is significant: 1. The \"Clean Break\" or Spin-Off Theory Dr. Rory Shaw was the Medical Director of Feedback PLC during its earlier growth phase (resigning in 2018). His reappointment to Bleepa Ltd and Brickshield Ltd on the same day that the group's CFO (Anesh Patel) officially stepped down (Nov 10, 2025) suggests a coordinated reshuffle. * Why Rory Shaw? He has \"legacy\" credibility. If Feedback is looking to sell off or spin out the Bleepa platform as a standalone entity to a private equity firm or a larger health-tech player, having a veteran clinical leader like Shaw on the subsidiary board provides stability and continuity that a \"new\" hire wouldn't offer. * The \"Brickshield\" Mystery: Brickshield has historically been a dormant vehicle. Its reactivation suggests it may be used to house a specific piece of IP or a new contract that the parent company wants to keep legally separate from the main PLC balance sheet\u2014potentially to make it \"deal-ready.\" 2. Strategic \"Ring-Fencing\" for Funding Feedback's recent 2025 presentations emphasized a \"digital-first\" NHS and the expansion of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs). * By activating Bleepa Ltd (the namesake of their flagship product) as a functional subsidiary rather than just a brand name within \"Feedback Medical Ltd,\" they may be preparing to take on project-specific investment. * If a partner (like a Tier 1 medical imaging company) wanted to invest specifically in the Bleepa technology without buying into the entire PLC, appointing Shaw\u2014who understands the clinical architecture\u2014would be a move to satisfy due diligence requirements. 3. The Takeover Protection & Valuation Angle As of November 2025, Feedback PLC confirmed it is subject to the UK Takeover Code. When a company is \"in play\" or expecting an approach: * They often tidy up their corporate structure. * Moving key assets (like the Bleepa trademark and operations) into a dedicated subsidiary like Bleepa Ltd makes the company easier to value for a potential suitor. * Shaw\u2019s appointment could be as a \"Safe Pair of Hands\" to oversee this transition, allowing CEO Tom Oakley to focus on the high-level PLC management and investor relations during a sale process. Why the 10th of November is the \"Smoking Gun\" The fact that these appointments happened on the exact day the new CFO (Emma Oswick) took over and the old CFO departed is n",

Interesting times for sure and maybe, just maybe, we will see contract details in the not too distant future. My major concern now is competition. Whilst claims made by TO would suggest that there is no competitive offering likely to replace Bleepa in those NHS solution areas for which we are bidding, the slow pace of decision making has given competition time to develop and promote an alternative. In particular, I am concerned about the Chinese who are particularly adept at copying IP and positioning cheaper alternatives. The UK Govt and Whitehall, are, unfortunately, prone to adopting Chinese solutions no matter how risky from a security standpoint. I would imagine the Chinese would love to infiltrate the NHS",

However, on 10th Nov. 25 Dr Rory James SHAW was appointed as Director, the same person who resigned from FDBK medical in 2018! So why appoint a previous director to a sleeping subsidiary ? This is where it gets even more interesting which leads me to think something is likely to happen sooner rather than later. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/12118570/officers It looks as if Feedback Medical have another subsiduary called Brickshield Ltd, a dormant company with Tom Oakley made as Director in April 23.  But again, Dr Rory James Shaw, ex director of FDBK  was made Director on the same date, as Bleepa Ltd above on the 10th Nov 25. https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06514313/officers Just for clarity these appointments in the FDBK subsidiaries have both been made after the September 25 investor presentations\u2026.something occurring!

GP Connect ( Bleepa being one of the first partners integrated into the new NHS  GP Connect - so now any GP practice can be added across the UK). or, The New Partner ( not named) - Elective Recovery Opportunity - they stated  in Q&A  will update as progress, have potential customers already ! AWS interested in UK Opportunity, apparently They have a near term opportunity according to presentation with a Private Care Provider ( could be one of the larger ones) Positive news from QVH who are continuing to trial ( paid for by NHS)  and create multiple new pathways = BIG Pilot, could lead to larger contract than just one individual hospital. News from Vertex in South Africa or middle East who are now using Bleepa as an add on to their own products - so customers already on board Tom did state that  BLEEPA was in fact CHOSEN as a Digital solution ready for National Rollout by the ERS funding mechanism , but this opportunity disappeared due to the  elections ...see RNS , shares doubled shortly after....so IMO it sound like FDBK had this opportunity in the bag, and it was lost due to the elections - so this is their second attempt, but with a years behind the scenes progress . As far as the spending review funding Tom did state it could be available anytime up until beginning of next tax year - April 26   - so a small chance of earlier news. Plus someone seems to buying the shares in numbers. So , i thought i would start to add again as the sp has dropped considerably and 12 weeks is nothing compared to some of the timelines i have had to wait with other shares.  GL Vas",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

          "content": "So I cut and paste your post into Gemini AI: This is a sophisticated observation of corporate maneuvering, and the timing of these appointments\u2014specifically November 10, 2025\u2014is highly suggestive of a strategic shift at Feedback PLC (FDBK). When a dormant or \"sleeping\" subsidiary suddenly has a seasoned former director appointed alongside the current CEO, it typically points to one of three corporate actions: a divestment/spin-off, a joint venture, or a ring-fencing of specific intellectual property (IP). Here is an analysis of why Dr. Rory Shaw\u2019s return to these specific entities is significant: 1. The \"Clean Break\" or Spin-Off Theory Dr. Rory Shaw was the Medical Director of Feedback PLC during its earlier growth phase (resigning in 2018). His reappointment to Bleepa Ltd and Brickshield Ltd on the same day that the group's CFO (Anesh Patel) officially stepped down (Nov 10, 2025) suggests a coordinated reshuffle. * Why Rory Shaw? He has \"legacy\" credibility. If Feedback is looking to sell off or spin out the Bleepa platform as a standalone entity to a private equity firm or a larger health-tech player, having a veteran clinical leader like Shaw on the subsidiary board provides stability and continuity that a \"new\" hire wouldn't offer. * The \"Brickshield\" Mystery: Brickshield has historically been a dormant vehicle. Its reactivation suggests it may be used to house a specific piece of IP or a new contract that the parent company wants to keep legally separate from the main PLC balance sheet\u2014potentially to make it \"deal-ready.\" 2. Strategic \"Ring-Fencing\" for Funding Feedback's recent 2025 presentations emphasized a \"digital-first\" NHS and the expansion of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs). * By activating Bleepa Ltd (the namesake of their flagship product) as a functional subsidiary rather than just a brand name within \"Feedback Medical Ltd,\" they may be preparing to take on project-specific investment. * If a partner (like a Tier 1 medical imaging company) wanted to invest specifically in the Bleepa technology without buying into the entire PLC, appointing Shaw\u2014who understands the clinical architecture\u2014would be a move to satisfy due diligence requirements. 3. The Takeover Protection & Valuation Angle As of November 2025, Feedback PLC confirmed it is subject to the UK Takeover Code. When a company is \"in play\" or expecting an approach: * They often tidy up their corporate structure. * Moving key assets (like the Bleepa trademark and operations) into a dedicated subsidiary like Bleepa Ltd makes the company easier to value for a potential suitor. * Shaw\u2019s appointment could be as a \"Safe Pair of Hands\" to oversee this transition, allowing CEO Tom Oakley to focus on the high-level PLC management and investor relations during a sale process. Why the 10th of November is the \"Smoking Gun\" The fact that these appointments happened on the exact day the new CFO (Emma Oswick) took over and the old CFO departed is n",

Interesting times for sure and maybe, just maybe, we will see contract details in the not too distant future. My major concern now is competition. Whilst claims made by TO would suggest that there is no competitive offering likely to replace Bleepa in those NHS solution areas for which we are bidding, the slow pace of decision making has given competition time to develop and promote an alternative. In particular, I am concerned about the Chinese who are particularly adept at copying IP and positioning cheaper alternatives. The UK Govt and Whitehall, are, unfortunately, prone to adopting Chinese solutions no matter how risky from a security standpoint. I would imagine the Chinese would love to infiltrate the NHS",

          "content": "Hi Private, I cut my holding by half at last presentation and will add probably quite soon. The reason being that i am hoping we receive earlier news regarding other opportunities mentioned in the investor presentation , while we await the decision from the NHS regarding the Elective Recovery Funding,  with Bleepa being the only serious contender and already integrated in the NHS systems and completed trials etc, i think we stand a good chance of being funding for a national rollout. also sometime soon i get the feeling form the presentation that they hope to release some earlier news such as ... GP Connect ( Bleepa being one of the first partners integrated into the new NHS  GP Connect - so now any GP practice can be added across the UK). or, The New Partner ( not named) - Elective Recovery Opportunity - they stated  in Q&A  will update as progress, have potential customers already ! AWS interested in UK Opportunity, apparently They have a near term opportunity according to presentation with a Private Care Provider ( could be one of the larger ones) Positive news from QVH who are continuing to trial ( paid for by NHS)  and create multiple new pathways = BIG Pilot, could lead to larger contract than just one individual hospital. News from Vertex in South Africa or middle East who are now using Bleepa as an add on to their own products - so customers already on board Tom did state that  BLEEPA was in fact CHOSEN as a Digital solution ready for National Rollout by the ERS funding mechanism , but this opportunity disappeared due to the  elections ...see RNS , shares doubled shortly after....so IMO it sound like FDBK had this opportunity in the bag, and it was lost due to the elections - so this is their second attempt, but with a years behind the scenes progress . As far as the spending review funding Tom did state it could be available anytime up until beginning of next tax year - April 26   - so a small chance of earlier news. Plus someone seems to buying the shares in numbers. So , i thought i would start to add again as the sp has dropped considerably and 12 weeks is nothing compared to some of the timelines i have had to wait with other shares.  GL Vas",

The key phrase imo is\u2026 \u201c Hospitals across Sussex are preparing for a major digital upgrade designed to improve patient safety and provide more joined-up care. University Hospitals Sussex (UHSussex) has selected a supplier to deliver a new electronic patient record (EPR) system across all of its hospitals, marking a key milestone in the Trust\u2019s long-term Excellent Care Everywhere strategy.\u201d Note\u2026.\u201c to deliver a EPR system across All of its hospitals\u201d As we know QVH  along with FDBK medical is continuing their work and extending the Bleepa reach and pathway's to community and other hospitals, possibly.  This was discussed at the Sept 25 Q&A\u2026..It could be used as a  blueprint for  national rollout possibly,  but NHS wanted more connections and pathways . The seven NHS provider partners in the Sussex Health and Care system are: University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Hard to imagine that FDBK not involved at some point. Providers can use more than one EPR as long as they are interoperable\u2026FDBK will hopefully provide the glue to allow them to securely communicate with each other. https://www.sussex.ics.nhs.uk/about-sussex-health-and-care/who-we-are/ Alcidion is the EPR company that has been selected as preferred EPR supplier by University Hospitals Sussex https://hospitaltimes.co.uk/alcidion-selected-as-preferred-epr-supplier-by-university-hospitals-sussex/",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

TPP was the first supplier to achieve a full national rollout for some GP Connect capabilities.

This sector ( GP Connect) is heating up, and is a small, niche area, with limited competition imo.  the value in Optum is the recently ( 18 months ago)  bought company EMIS that is only one of only four company's in UK NHS  that  provides the software for , and link up GP Connect.   As posted before the other three are TPP, FoT  and  Medicus , as far as i can see. We know FDBK are working with Optum and if this deal does go through , and Optum is sold to TPG -  this could open up doors in USA one day. TPG could get access to both GP Connect and possibly neighbourhood Health services in UK. Things seem to be moving along faster these days.....",

On the 16 th oct FDBK announced \u201c that the Diagnostic Enhanced Advice and Guidance diversions achieved through the Bleepa platform are now eligible for reimbursement under the Elective Recovery Fund (\"ERF\") and that any Integrated Care Board (\"ICB\") or hospital in England will, with immediate effect be able to utilise this funding, by local agreement, to reimburse expenditure on the Bleepa technology.\u201d This announcement meant that Bleepa had been chosen as an NHS supplier and was available nationally , funded locally, and reimbursed to hospital or PCT. The share price rose to 60 p. This award / mechanism was subsequently scrapped awaiting the elections and the SP dived, and has not recovered since. IMO this was not FDBKs fault and out of their control. I am confident that Bleepa , which was selected as a national solution for communication between primary and secondary care  in Oct 2024 , can do the same again, procured centrally this time . We continue to be reassured by Tom that Bleepa  still has no competition. Therefore the opportunity remains. If and when Bleepa is selected the SP should react in a similar way and possibly way beyond as the rollout progresses.  If Bleepa can nail this \u2026..the opportunities in UK could be just the beginning as digitalisation of health is happening across the world and will have the same effects as how digitalisation changed banking , retail and entertainment industry\u2019s. Just need that first positive announcement and this share will be off like a rocket.GL vas",

          "content": "So I cut and paste your post into Gemini AI: This is a sophisticated observation of corporate maneuvering, and the timing of these appointments\u2014specifically November 10, 2025\u2014is highly suggestive of a strategic shift at Feedback PLC (FDBK). When a dormant or \"sleeping\" subsidiary suddenly has a seasoned former director appointed alongside the current CEO, it typically points to one of three corporate actions: a divestment/spin-off, a joint venture, or a ring-fencing of specific intellectual property (IP). Here is an analysis of why Dr. Rory Shaw\u2019s return to these specific entities is significant: 1. The \"Clean Break\" or Spin-Off Theory Dr. Rory Shaw was the Medical Director of Feedback PLC during its earlier growth phase (resigning in 2018). His reappointment to Bleepa Ltd and Brickshield Ltd on the same day that the group's CFO (Anesh Patel) officially stepped down (Nov 10, 2025) suggests a coordinated reshuffle. * Why Rory Shaw? He has \"legacy\" credibility. If Feedback is looking to sell off or spin out the Bleepa platform as a standalone entity to a private equity firm or a larger health-tech player, having a veteran clinical leader like Shaw on the subsidiary board provides stability and continuity that a \"new\" hire wouldn't offer. * The \"Brickshield\" Mystery: Brickshield has historically been a dormant vehicle. Its reactivation suggests it may be used to house a specific piece of IP or a new contract that the parent company wants to keep legally separate from the main PLC balance sheet\u2014potentially to make it \"deal-ready.\" 2. Strategic \"Ring-Fencing\" for Funding Feedback's recent 2025 presentations emphasized a \"digital-first\" NHS and the expansion of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs). * By activating Bleepa Ltd (the namesake of their flagship product) as a functional subsidiary rather than just a brand name within \"Feedback Medical Ltd,\" they may be preparing to take on project-specific investment. * If a partner (like a Tier 1 medical imaging company) wanted to invest specifically in the Bleepa technology without buying into the entire PLC, appointing Shaw\u2014who understands the clinical architecture\u2014would be a move to satisfy due diligence requirements. 3. The Takeover Protection & Valuation Angle As of November 2025, Feedback PLC confirmed it is subject to the UK Takeover Code. When a company is \"in play\" or expecting an approach: * They often tidy up their corporate structure. * Moving key assets (like the Bleepa trademark and operations) into a dedicated subsidiary like Bleepa Ltd makes the company easier to value for a potential suitor. * Shaw\u2019s appointment could be as a \"Safe Pair of Hands\" to oversee this transition, allowing CEO Tom Oakley to focus on the high-level PLC management and investor relations during a sale process. Why the 10th of November is the \"Smoking Gun\" The fact that these appointments happened on the exact day the new CFO (Emma Oswick) took over and the old CFO departed is n",

Interesting times for sure and maybe, just maybe, we will see contract details in the not too distant future. My major concern now is competition. Whilst claims made by TO would suggest that there is no competitive offering likely to replace Bleepa in those NHS solution areas for which we are bidding, the slow pace of decision making has given competition time to develop and promote an alternative. In particular, I am concerned about the Chinese who are particularly adept at copying IP and positioning cheaper alternatives. The UK Govt and Whitehall, are, unfortunately, prone to adopting Chinese solutions no matter how risky from a security standpoint. I would imagine the Chinese would love to infiltrate the NHS",

          "content": "Hi Private, I cut my holding by half at last presentation and will add probably quite soon. The reason being that i am hoping we receive earlier news regarding other opportunities mentioned in the investor presentation , while we await the decision from the NHS regarding the Elective Recovery Funding,  with Bleepa being the only serious contender and already integrated in the NHS systems and completed trials etc, i think we stand a good chance of being funding for a national rollout. also sometime soon i get the feeling form the presentation that they hope to release some earlier news such as ... GP Connect ( Bleepa being one of the first partners integrated into the new NHS  GP Connect - so now any GP practice can be added across the UK). or, The New Partner ( not named) - Elective Recovery Opportunity - they stated  in Q&A  will update as progress, have potential customers already ! AWS interested in UK Opportunity, apparently They have a near term opportunity according to presentation with a Private Care Provider ( could be one of the larger ones) Positive news from QVH who are continuing to trial ( paid for by NHS)  and create multiple new pathways = BIG Pilot, could lead to larger contract than just one individual hospital. News from Vertex in South Africa or middle East who are now using Bleepa as an add on to their own products - so customers already on board Tom did state that  BLEEPA was in fact CHOSEN as a Digital solution ready for National Rollout by the ERS funding mechanism , but this opportunity disappeared due to the  elections ...see RNS , shares doubled shortly after....so IMO it sound like FDBK had this opportunity in the bag, and it was lost due to the elections - so this is their second attempt, but with a years behind the scenes progress . As far as the spending review funding Tom did state it could be available anytime up until beginning of next tax year - April 26   - so a small chance of earlier news. Plus someone seems to buying the shares in numbers. So , i thought i would start to add again as the sp has dropped considerably and 12 weeks is nothing compared to some of the timelines i have had to wait with other shares.  GL Vas",

Alcidion's solutions, such as Miya Results, Miya Observations, and Miya Precision, are software-based platforms used by clinicians for tasks like tracking test results, recording vital signs, and managing patient flow. \u201c To me Bleepa and Myra etc products are different, achieve different objectives and registered differently. iMO This modular system is a build it as you go , where Bleepa or other interoperable solutions can be added at any stage when required.",

The key phrase imo is\u2026 \u201c Hospitals across Sussex are preparing for a major digital upgrade designed to improve patient safety and provide more joined-up care. University Hospitals Sussex (UHSussex) has selected a supplier to deliver a new electronic patient record (EPR) system across all of its hospitals, marking a key milestone in the Trust\u2019s long-term Excellent Care Everywhere strategy.\u201d Note\u2026.\u201c to deliver a EPR system across All of its hospitals\u201d As we know QVH  along with FDBK medical is continuing their work and extending the Bleepa reach and pathway's to community and other hospitals, possibly.  This was discussed at the Sept 25 Q&A\u2026..It could be used as a  blueprint for  national rollout possibly,  but NHS wanted more connections and pathways . The seven NHS provider partners in the Sussex Health and Care system are: University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Queen Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust Hard to imagine that FDBK not involved at some point. Providers can use more than one EPR as long as they are interoperable\u2026FDBK will hopefully provide the glue to allow them to securely communicate with each other. https://www.sussex.ics.nhs.uk/about-sussex-health-and-care/who-we-are/ Alcidion is the EPR company that has been selected as preferred EPR supplier by University Hospitals Sussex https://hospitaltimes.co.uk/alcidion-selected-as-preferred-epr-supplier-by-university-hospitals-sussex/",

Read on for their predictions and expectations for the year ahead: \u201cShaun O\u2019Hanlon, chief executive, Optum (UK) \u201cTechnology will be the engine driving delivery of the NHS 10 year health plan, enabling care to move beyond hospital walls through interoperability, care coordination, and data-driven patient pathways. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a revolution in diagnostics and elective care, with intelligent, out-of-hospital pathways tackling waiting lists at their source in a more patient-centric and cost-conscious way. \u201cCommunity pharmacies will increasingly function as local health hubs, integrated into care pathways and empowering independent prescriber pharmacists to help balance demand. \u201cUnderpinning all of this will be next-generation AI \u2014 safer, transparent, and supported by strong governance and human oversight \u2014 driving productivity and better patient outcomes. 2026 will see technology delivering measurable impact, reshaping care delivery at scale.\u201d Also interesting comments from Sentra\u2026 \u201c Chris Scarisbrick, deputy UK managing director, Sectra \u201cImaging will be the pressure point in 2026. Pervasive workforce shortages and capacity challenges means it is an imperative to make imaging faster, more connected, and more intelligent. \u201cAI will accelerate this transformation in part, but only if NHS systems and networks can confidently embrace fast-paced and at-scale deployment, learning from regions that have already excelled. \u201cBut real progress goes beyond sprinkling algorithms into radiologists\u2019 workflows, especially at a time when diagnostic modernisation will be the make-or-break factor in NHS reform. \u201cThis demands a step change in diagnostic maturity, inter-disciplinary connectivity, and a willingness to modernise the underlying platforms that bind everything together. \u201cThe UK is already seeing impact where integrated diagnostics has been adopted in earnest: productivity jumps, clinical collaboration strengthens, and patient pathways speed up. In 2026, the organisations that break remaining silos will be the ones that move the needle.\u201d https://www.digitalhealth.net/2026/01/2026-predictions-health-tech-suppliers-have-their-say/",

It is a robust clinical record system integrated with the GP Connect APIs. TPP SystmOne: Used by most of the remaining practices, it has a single central record store across all GPs using the system. TPP was the first supplier to achieve a full national rollout for some GP Connect capabilities. Medicus Health: A smaller, newer provider that has also achieved full rollout approval for several GP Connect services. If in the future FDBK do win to supply nationally, then any early work , trials with Optum would mean thatFDBK would also need to be included in the other providers such as TPP, I guess.",

This sector ( GP Connect) is heating up, and is a small, niche area, with limited competition imo.  the value in Optum is the recently ( 18 months ago)  bought company EMIS that is only one of only four company's in UK NHS  that  provides the software for , and link up GP Connect.   As posted before the other three are TPP, FoT  and  Medicus , as far as i can see. We know FDBK are working with Optum and if this deal does go through , and Optum is sold to TPG -  this could open up doors in USA one day. TPG could get access to both GP Connect and possibly neighbourhood Health services in UK. Things seem to be moving along faster these days.....",
