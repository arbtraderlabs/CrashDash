We design products that enhance clinician access to patient data and to their colleagues. Our unique approach centres around individual patient episodes, into which we pull relevant clinical data from hospital systems and around which we build remote clinical teams for collaboration. As a result, we produce a digital infrastructure that makes patient data available to clinicians in multiple settings, in a format that enables them to meaningfully interact with it, providing flexibility to clinicians and free movement of patients between provider settings - clinicians can practice from anywhere and patients can attend any care provider for treatment, with greater connectivity across organisations.\nOur products Bleepa\u00ae and CareLocker\u00ae work together to deliver unparalleled value to our customers. Bleepa\u00ae is our application layer and sits on top of CareLocker\u00ae as our data layer. Bleepa\u00ae is a clinician facing platform that displays clinical results from a patient's CareLocker\u00ae at a certified and regulated quality, that is suitable for clinical use and enables dialogue on a patient-by-patient basis with colleagues through a secure, auditable chat interface that links back to the patient medical record. The CareLocker\u00ae data storage model is built around the patient. Our vision is one where relevant clinical data is always available to the patient as well as to any care setting that they may attend - a federated data architecture with the patient as the tenant.\nThe Company has a number of growth opportunities domestically and internationally across a range of markets including the NHS and private healthcare providers and its highly scalable Software as a Service (\"SaaS\")-based model is expected to provide increasing levels of revenue visibility as the Company grows its customer base.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

With the publication of this announcement, this information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFeedback plc\nTrading Update\nFeedback plc (AIM: FDBK, \"Feedback\" or the \"Company\"), the clinical infrastructure specialist, announces a trading update for the financial year ended 31 May 2024 (\"FY2024\") (the \"Period\").\nFY2024 revenue is expected to be around \u00a31.2m, approximately 15% higher than the prior year. The EBITDA loss for FY2024 is expected to improve in comparison to market expectations, despite the slower than anticipated revenue growth in FY2024, as the Company continues to optimise its cost base. As such, the Company's FY2024 closing cash position is expected to be at least in line with market expectations.\nThe Company's cash balance as at 30 April 2024 was \u00a34.3m.\nNHS procurement processes are more protracted for novel technologies such as Bleepa compared to the replacement of existing similar services where NHS procurement and funding is relatively more straightforward.\nThe Company has been nurturing a number of commercial opportunities with national and regional NHS organisations which we had hoped to convert during the Period; unfortunately, the financial and operational pressures facing the NHS have delayed a number of these strategic conversations and consequently, the Board now believes that these larger NHS opportunities are likely to mature during the upcoming financial year.\nDr Tom Oakley, CEO commented:\n\"Despite a delay in some of our larger national and regional NHS opportunities we have delivered revenue growth in FY2024 and optimised our cost base.\n\"B\nased on information currently available to us\nwe anticipate that new funding streams will land in the system that will enable us to progress with our wider pipeline of opportunity and build on the fantastic foundation that we have built to date, and we are therefore expecting these opportunities to convert to contract and be recognised within FY2025 revenue.\n\"In the meantime, this has given us an opportunity to continue pursuing our international opportunities and we are making promising progress in India around TB screening and other upcoming opportunities that have been unlocked by our in-country MD, Rohit Singh, having established the right to sell Bleepa as a medical device.\"\n--Ends--\nEnquiries:\nFeedback plc\nTom Oakley, CEO\nAnesh Patel, CFO\n+44 (0) 20 3997 7634\nIR@fbk.com\nPanmure Gordon (UK) Limited (NOMAD and Broker)\nEmma Earl/Freddy Crossley (Corporate Finance)\nRupert Dearden (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0)20 7886 2500\nWalbrook PR Ltd;\nTel: 020 7933 8780 or\nfeedbackplc@walbrookpr.com\nNick Rome/Joe Walker\n07748 325 236 or 07407 020 470\nAbout Feedback\nFeedback plc helps clinical teams to make better decisions faster for patients.
