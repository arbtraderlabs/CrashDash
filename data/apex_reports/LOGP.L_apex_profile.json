Upon the publication of this announcement via Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nIf you have any queries on this, then please contact Steve Boldy, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (responsible for arranging release of this announcement).\n22 December 2025\nLansdowne Oil & Gas plc\n(\"Lansdowne\" or the \"Company\")\nFunding Secured for Energy Charter Treaty Arbitration Claim\nLansdowne Oil & Gas is pleased to announce that it has signed an Engagement Letter (\"EL\") with Diamond McCarthy LLP to pursue its Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\") arbitration claim against Ireland for the refusal to award a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe Oil and Gas field. The EL provides for Lansdowne's expected costs associated with the claim, to be fully funded by Diamond McCarthy LLP, on a non-recourse basis. The compensation claim is expected to be a minimum of US$100 million plus interest.\nBackground\nAn application for a Lease Undertaking was submitted in April 2021, as a follow-on authorisation to Lansdowne's Exploration Licence SEL1/11, in which it held a 20% interest, through its 100% owned subsidiary, Lansdowne Celtic Sea Limited.\nUnder the terms of the SEL1/11 Licence the licencees had the right to progress to a Lease Undertaking.\nAfter considerable delay, in May 2023 the application for a Lease Undertaking was refused by the Irish Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.\nIn June 2023 Lansdowne gave Ireland notice that a dispute existed under the ECT.\nEngagement with Diamond McCarthy LLP\nThe EL provides sufficient funds, on a non-recourse basis, to cover legal fees and costs associated with pursuing the claim through to resolution. Diamond McCarthy is a U.S. law firm with decades of experience in cross-border litigation and international arbitration.\nTo date, Lansdowne has been advised on its claim by Mantle Law, a London and United Arab Emirates based international arbitration law firm with a focus on energy, construction, and infrastructure disputes. Mantle Law and Diamond McCarthy will co-counsel to progress the claim to conclusion.\nThe gross compensation claim is expected to be at least $100 million plus interest. In the event of a successful award in an amount of approximately $100 million, Lansdowne's share of the proceeds is expected to be between 60% and 70%.\nFurther updates will be provided as and when appropriate.\nReverse Take Over (\"RTO\") Update and Readmission to AIM\nThe documentation required to complete the RTO is in near final form and completion of this process is now expected to take place in Q1 2026.\nTrading in the Company's shares remains suspended awaiting a successful conclusion to the planned RTO.\nStephen Boldy, CEO of Lansdowne commented:\n\"On behalf of Lansdowne and all our shareholders, I would like to thank the legal teams that have worked on our case to reach this substantial funding agreement, which will allow us to proceed to seek just compensation for the loss of our Barryroe asset.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nLansdowne Oil & Gas plc\nSteve Boldy\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nStuart Gledhill\nRichard Hail\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3192 1739\nJoint Broker\nOliver Stansfield\nNotes to editors:\nAbout Lansdowne\nLansdowne Oil & Gas (LOGP.LN) is an, oil and gas exploration and appraisal company quoted on the AIM market, that was previously focused on the North Celtic Sea.\nIn May 2023 the application for a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe oil and gas field, in which Lansdowne held a 20% interest, was refused by the Irish Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.\nIn June 2023 Lansdowne announced the commencement of action under the Arbitration Process of the Energy Charter Treaty.\nOn 20 September 2023, Lansdowne announced that, under AIM Rule 15, the Company had been designated to be a cash shell. Accordingly, the shares of the Company were suspended from trading on AIM as at 07.30am on 21 March 2024.\nFor more information on Lansdowne, please refer to\nwww.lansdowneoilandgas.com\n.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Basis of Presentation\nAccounting Policies\nThe interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 has been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies which were adopted in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts and IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\".\nThe interim financial information does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The results for the six months to 30 June 2025 and the interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (UK IASs). Those 2024 financial statements have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and include an auditor's report which was unqualified and did not contain a statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. It did, however, include a material uncertainty related to going concern.\n2. Going concern\nThe Directors have prepared the interim financial information on the going concern basis which assumes that the Group and Company and its subsidiaries will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nAs outlined in the 2024 Annual Report, following the refusal of the Irish Minister for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to award a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe oil and gas field, the \u00a316.4 million intangible asset value was written off.\nLansdowne, however, is continuing to pursue compensation for loss via the Energy Charter Treaty.\nIn the most recent Competent Persons Report (CPR) produced by RPS in 2022 on the Barryroe oil and gas field Phase 1 development, and solely based upon the Basal Wealden Oil reservoir, P50 gross recoverable oil volumes of 81.2 million barrels were estimated (16.24 million barrels net to Lansdowne), from a Best Estimate of 278 million barrels of oil in place (STOIIP).\nAn economic evaluation based upon the above 2C resources case, delivered an NPV10% for Lansdowne's 20% share of $104 million (\u00a377 million) under a Brent Oil Price assumption of $68 - $70/barrel.\nThe Company has joined with other qualifying investors in the Barryroe project to pursue compensation and work continued on the ECT claim throughout the first half of the year.\nA great deal of information has been provided to a potential third party litigation funder, that has expressed interest in funding the claim and a final decision is expected in the near future.\nWhilst the Company remains confident of the merits of the claim, there can be no guarantee of a favourable outcome to the litigation funding.\nThrough the first half of the year a great deal of work was also carried out on progressing a Reverse Take Over (RTO) to acquire a new asset and all documents are now at an advanced stage.\nA fund-raising is planned to accompany the Reverse Take Over and the process of re-admission of the Company's shares to trading on AIM. This is now expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nThe ability of the Group and Company to continue as a going concern, relies upon successful future equity fund-raising and continued support from the holder of the Company's Loan Note.\nThe Directors have considered the matters set out above and have concluded that a material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt on the ability of the Group and Company to continue as a going concern.\nNevertheless, after making enquiries considering the uncertainties described above, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. These financial statements do not include any adjustment that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.\n3. Loss per share\nThe loss for the period was wholly from continuing operations.\nUnaudited6 monthsended30 June '25\nUnaudited6 monthsended30 June '24\nAuditedYearended31 Dec. '24\n\u00a3000s\n\u00a3000s\n\u00a3000s\nLoss per share arising from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the Company\n- basic and diluted (in pence)\n(0.02)\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\nThe calculations were based on the following information:\nLoss attributable to equity holders of the Company\n(337)\n(138)\n(336)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\nIn issue - basic and diluted\n1,393,618,337\n1,393,618,337\n1,393,179,981\nFor diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares - share options. As a loss was recorded for all periods reported, the issue of new shares would have been anti-dilutive.\n4. Convertible Loan Notes\nIn January 2025 and March 2025, the Company announced the completion of a further Convertible Loan Agreement with existing shareholders, for \u00a345,000 and \u00a350,000 respectively. These Convertible Loan Notes were arranged by Tavira Financial Limited, the Company's joint broker, with Directors of the Company and a number of existing shareholders.\nThe Loans are unsecured, carry no interest, have no maturity date and shall be converted into new ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\") at time of completing a reverse takeover and subject to shareholder approval for the extension of share issuance authorities. The conversion price will be the lower of 0.1 pence (being the share price at the time of suspension on 21 March 2024), or a 20% discount price to the issue price at the time of any issuance of shares alongside a future reverse takeover. As at the date of publication of these interim accounts, the takeover is expected to take place around December 2025.\nThe net proceeds received \u00a395,000 (after deductible transaction costs of \u00a3Nil) from the issue of the convertible loan notes and as per IAS 32 have been split between the equity host element and derivative liability component.\nDerivative Financial Liability\nGiven that the conversion price is defined as the lower of 0.1p per share or a 20% discount to the Reverse Takeover (RTO) issue price, the conversion feature fails the 'fixed-for-fixed' condition under IAS 32.16b(ii). This is because the number of shares to be delivered will vary depending on the RTO issue price and whether it falls below 0.1p at the time the conversion is triggered. On this basis, the conversion feature is a derivative financial liability (DFL).\nInitial recognition and measurement\nAt the initial recognition, the DFL is measured at fair value. The fair value of the DFL at the date of issuance of the convertible loans has been determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which considered multiple variables, including:\n\u00b7\nExpected share price volatility\n\u00b7\nRisk-free interest rate\n\u00b7\nExpected life of the instrument\n\u00b7\nConversion probabilities and potential share price performance\n\u00b7\nSubsequent measurement\nSubsequent to initial recognition, the DFL is remeasured at fair value at each conversion event and at each reporting date, with any changes in fair value recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nAs at 30 June 2025, the fair value of the DFL was as follows:\nGroup and Company\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 January 2024\n-\nCLNs issued during the year\n37\nFair value through income statement\n(10)\nAt 31 December 2024\n27\nCLNs issued during the period\n38\nFair value through income statement\n(10)\nAt 30 June 2025\n55\nEquity Host Contract\nThe principal (host contract) was issued with the intention for it to be converted into equity upon completion of the RTO. Until that point, both parties intend for the CLNs to remain outstanding indefinitely. The parties do not intend for the principal to be repaid in cash, and therefore the principal is an equity host contract.\nInitial recognition and measurement\nThe value of the host contract is determined as the difference between the proceeds received (net of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of the instrument) and the fair value of the embedded derivative.\nThe equity component is not remeasured and remains within equity unless the instrument is modified or converted.\nGroup and Company\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 January 2024\n-\nCLNs issued during the year\n48\nAllocated transaction costs\n(3)\nAt 31 December 2024\n45\nCLNs issued during the period\n58\nAllocated transaction costs\n-\nAt 30 June 2025\n103\n5. Post Balance Sheet Events\nIn July 2025 the Company announced the completion of further Convertible Loan Agreement for \u00a350,000 on the same terms as those issued in September 2024, January 2025 and March 2025.\n6. Shareholder loan\nThe shareholder loan of \u00a31.110 million (31 December 2024: \u00a31.085 million) relates to a senior secured loan note issued in 2015 to LC Capital Master Fund Limited at a coupon rate of 5%.\n7.

The Company will convene its Annual General Meeting once an application is made for re-admission to trading on AIM.\nCopies of the 2024 Annual Report & Accounts will shortly be available to download from the Company's website,\nwww.lansdowneoilandgas.com\nOperational highlights\n\u00b7\nThe Company continued to engage with potential litigation funders to provide finance to take forward the Barryroe ECT claim.\n\u00b7\nLansdowne has joined with other qualifying investors to progress the claim.\n\u00b7\nA great deal of information has been provided to a potential third-party litigation funder, which has indicated interest in funding such a claim.\n\u00b7\nLansdowne and its co-claimants are progressing the necessary legal agreements to put third-party funding in place.\n\u00b7\nAn outcome is expected in the third quarter of 2025.

A number of opportunities were reviewed and a suitable candidate selected.\n\u00b7\nThis work entailed a great deal of necessary documentation, required for application to re-admission to trading on AIM.

Accordingly, the shares of the Company were suspended from trading on AIM as at 07.30 am on 21 March 2024 (\"Suspension\").\nFor more information on Lansdowne, please refer to\nwww.lansdowneoilandgas.com\n.\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nIntroduction\nDuring the first half of 2024 the Company focused upon progressing its Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\") claim against Ireland for the failure to award a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe oil and gas field.\nLansdowne's external lawyers produced briefing materials and contacted a wide range of potential litigation funders.\nOne of the consequences of the loss of the Company's interest in the Barryroe Licence, was that as of 20 September 2023, Lansdowne was designated a \"Cash Shell\", under AIM Rule 15. A cash shell company is required to undertake either an acquisition or a reverse takeover to comply with listing requirements.\nAs no such acquisition or reverse takeover had been completed within the six month period, as of 21 March 2024 Lansdowne's shares were suspended from trading on AIM.\nAlso in March 2024, the Company announced that it would \"Record Date\" the Registered Shareholders of the Company from 21 March 2024 in order to ensure that these shareholders would be protected to receive all or a substantial proportion of any proceeds received from a successful ECT claim.\nIn the second half of the year attention turned to seeking a suitable target for acquisition, which would constitute a Reverse Take Over. A number of opportunities were reviewed and a suitable candidate selected.\nThis work entailed a great deal of necessary documentation, which was progressed in parallel with continued dialogue regarding third party litigation funding.\nFinancial Results\nThe Group recorded an after tax loss of \u00a30.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2024 compared to a loss of \u00a316.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nGroup operating expenses for the year were \u00a30.3 million, compared to \u00a316.8 million in 2023. Net finance expense for the year was \u00a352,000 (2023: \u00a354,000). Cash balances of \u00a30.01 million (2023: \u00a30.02 million) were held at the end of the financial year.\nThe spend incurred on the Barryroe licence area for the year totalled NIL (2023: \u00a359,770 ).\nTotal net liability as at the year end attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Group was \u00a3(1.27) million as at 31 December 2024 (\u00a3(1.11) million as at 31 December 2023).\nIn December 2023, the Company placed 40,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each, to raise \u00a340,000 before costs; and a second tranche of 160,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each to raise \u00a3160,000, conditional on the passing of resolutions at a General Meeting of the Company's shareholders held on 29 December 2023.These resolutions were duly passed. The issuance and trading of the shares took place on 2 January 2024.\nIn association with the Placing, 10,000,000 warrants were granted to the broker Tavira Financial Limited, with an exercise price of 0.1p per ordinary share. The Broker Warrants will be exercisable up until the third anniversary of admission of the Conditional Placing Shares to trading on AIM.\nAlso in December 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with LC Capital Master Fund to extend the repayment date of its outstanding loan which was due for repayment on 31 December 2023 to 30 June 2024.Following this, a further extension was approved after June 2024, and discussions regarding the loan repayment terms are still ongoing with company management and a renewed agreement has not been signed as of the date of signing the accounts. The amount of the Loan on 31 December 2024 was \u00a31,084,849 (2023 : \u00a31,033,189).\nFurther, as part of LC Capital's agreement to the Loan Extension, the Company has agreed to certain amendments to the LC Warrant Instrument.\nThe foregoing arrangements provide that:\n-\nthe exercise period for all of the warrants granted under the LC Warrant Instrument (including the LC Warrants) has been extended to now expire on 30 June 2024 , in line with the Loan Extension; and\n- as a result of the Maturity Date being extended, the provisions of the LC Warrant Instrument, which provided for the warrants granted under the LC Warrant Instrument being adjusted in the event of the Company completing any equity fundraising(s) prior to 31 December 2023 will apply in respect of any Equity Fundraising completed prior to 30 June 2024.\nIn September 2024, Lansdowne announced that it had entered into a Convertible Loan Agreement for \u00a395,000 (the \"Loan\"), arranged by Tavira Financial Limited, the Company's joint broker, with Directors of the Company and a number of existing shareholders. \u00a310,000 of this total has yet to be finalised, although the Company still expects to receive it in due course.\nThe Loan is unsecured, carries no interest, and shall be converted into new ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\") at the time of completing a reverse takeover and subject to shareholder approval for the extension of share issuance authorities. The conversion price will be the lower of 0.1 pence (being the share price at the time of suspension on 21 March 2024) or a 20% discount to the issue price at the time of any share issuance alongside a future reverse takeover. As at the date of signing these accounts, the reverse takeover is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2025.\nIn February 2025, the Company announced the completion of a further Convertible Loan Agreement with existing shareholders for \u00a345,000, on the same terms.\nThis loan is structured similarly to the Convertible Loan Notes issued in September 2024. The Loan is unsecured, carries no interest, and shall be converted into New Ordinary Shares at the time of completing a reverse takeover, subject to shareholder approval for the extension of share issuance authorities. The conversion price remains the lower of 0.1 pence or a 20% discount to the share issue price at the time of the reverse takeover. As above, at the date of signing these accounts, the reverse takeover is expected to take place in the third quarter of 2025.\nOn 30 July 2025, the Company announced the issuance of a further \u00a3100,000 of Convertible Loan Notes, made under the same terms as the previous issues in September 2024 and February 2025.\nLansdowne used the funds to provide working capital while discussions continue with potential funders for Lansdowne's Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) claim against Ireland, and work progresses toward a potential reverse takeover.\nTrading in the Company's shares on AIM remains suspended while progress continues on the potential reverse takeover.\nOutlook for the Group\nThe Company is continuing to progress the reverse takeover, with the intention to complete this in the third quarter of 2025.\nRegarding the ECT claim, a substantial amount of information has been provided to a potential third-party litigation funder, which has indicated interest in funding the claim. This is also expected to come to fruition in the third quarter. However, there can be no guarantee that such funding will be secured.\nOn behalf of the CEO and myself, I wish to express our sincere appreciation to the shareholders for their continued support.\nOn behalf of the board\nMr J D Auld\nChairman\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nThis Strategic Report has been prepared to inform shareholders and help them to assess how the Directors have performed their duty to promote the success of Lansdowne Oil & Gas plc (\"the Company\") and its subsidiaries (together \"the Group\").\nPrincipal activities\nThe Group was founded as an upstream oil and gas entity, focused on exploration and appraisal opportunities offshore Ireland. The Group targeted shallow water (less than 100 metres)areas of the Irish shelf as these provided lower cost drilling opportunities, which combined with the favourable fiscal terms, had the potential to deliver high value oil and gas reserves.\nFollowing the loss of the Barryroe Asset, the Group work has concentrated on seeking compensation through the Energy Charter Treaty.\nWork has also advanced to acquire a new asset by way of a Reverse Take Over, in order to seek re-admission to trading on AIM.\nReview of the business\nDetails of the Group's activities during the year and its position at the end of the year are given in the Chairman's Statement.\nThe Group and Company Statements of Financial Position as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 are shown on pages 20 and 21 respectively. Group net liabilities at 31 December 2024 were \u00a3 (1.27) million (2023: \u00a3(1.11) million). At 31 December 2023, the Group held \u00a30.01 million (2023: \u00a30.02 million) as cash or short-term deposits.\nThe Group had intangible assets totalling \u00a3 NIL (2023: NIL) at the reporting date. These assets related to the Group's exploration licences in the Celtic Sea and their associated work programmes. The intangible assets held through a subsidiary were fully impaired in 2023 by the management in light of events in relation to refusal of the lease undertaking by the Irish Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (\"DECC\").\nDuring the year, the Group had one full-time Executive Director, with administration and accounting support provided by PJT & Co under a service agreement. These costs, together with the costs associated with the Company's listed status and general overheads, accounted for the administrative expenses of \u00a3 0.3 million (2023: \u00a316.8 million). The Total operating expenses of \u00a316.8 million in 2023 included a full impairment charge of \u00a316.4 million related to the capitalisation of the Barryroe intangible assets.\nA loss after tax of \u00a30.3 million (2023: \u00a316.3 million) was recorded in the year and the basic and diluted loss per share for the year was 0.02p (2023: 1.53p).\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nThe principal risk facing the Group is the potential failure to secure compensation through legal proceedings for its investment in the Barryroe oil and gas project.\nThe value of compensation being sought is linked to the pricing of both oil and gas.\nThe Brent Oil Price averaged around c.$80/bbl in 2023 and since then has mostly remained above $70/bbl, where it lies today.\nThe Irish gas price is linked to the UK gas price as the majority of Ireland's gas supply flows through the interconnector from the UK. UK prices rose rapidly as a result of the war in Ukraine and in 2023 averaged above 100p/therm. Prices remain high and are currently c. 90p/therm.\nPrevious Independent Competent Persons Reports have demonstrated that the Barryroe project delivers robust returns at these current oil and gas price levels, which will support Lansdowne's claim for compensation.\nAs a participant in the upstream oil & gas industry, the Group is exposed to a wide range of risks in the conduct of its operations.\nThese risks include:\nFinancial risks:\n\u2022 Ability to raise finance to pursue litigation\n\u2022 Cost inflation\n\u2022 Oil and gas price movements\n\u2022 Adverse taxation legislative changes\n\u2022 Third party counterparty credit risk\n\u2022 Adverse foreign exchange movements\n\u2022 Changes in government policy\nOperational risks:\n\u2022 Loss of key employees\n\u2022 Delay and cost overrun on projects, including weather related delay\n\u2022 HSE incidents\n\u2022 Poor reservoir performance\n\u2022 Exploration and appraisal well failures\nStrategic and external risks:\n\u2022 Failure of third party services\n\u2022 Deterioration of capital markets, inhibiting efficient equity and/or debt raising for developments\n\u2022 Commercial misalignment with co-venturers\n\u2022 Material fall in oil or gas prices\nMarket risks:\nThe key risk facing the Group is failure to be granted compensation for the loss of the Barryroe asset, which is being persued under the Terms of the Energy Charter Treaty.\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These are discussed in Note 21. In the normal course of business, the Group also faces certain other non-financial or nonquantifiable risks. To the extent that the Group's oil and gas assets can be successfully developed, the Group's assets, revenues and cash flows may become dominated by Dollar or Euro-based oil and gas operations. Accordingly, the Sterling/Dollar and Sterling/ Euro exchange rates are important to the Sterling prices of the Shares traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe tables below sets forth, for the periods and dates indicated, the exchange rate for the Dollar against Sterling and for the Euro against Sterling.\nDollar/Sterling Exchange Rates (Dollar per Pound Sterling)\nAt end of year\nAverage Rate\nHigh\nLow\n2023\n1.25\n1.24\n1.29\n1.2\n2024\n1.27\n1.27\n1.32\n1.17\nEuro/Sterling Exchange Rates (Euro per Pound Sterling)\nAt end of year\nAverage Rate\nHigh\nLow\n2023\n1.15\n1.15\n1.17\n1.12\n2024\n1.20\n1.19\n1.26\n1.16\n* The average rates are calculated based on the last business day of each full month during the relevant year.\nDetails of how the Group manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks are set out in Note 21.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Group has no ongoing exploration or development activities, and all previously capitalised intangible assets were fully impaired as at 30 June 2023. Accordingly, exposure to risks associated with hydrocarbon commodity price volatility is currently minimal. Nevertheless, the Group remains exposed to a number of residual strategic and financial risks.\nThe Group operates within a highly competitive sector, where larger and better-capitalised companies are often better positioned to secure new opportunities. The ability to reinitiate or expand operations in the future may be adversely affected by regulatory developments, including changes in environmental and climate-related legislation, which could increase compliance costs or render certain activities economically unviable. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, including potential economic downturns and rising interest rates, may limit the availability of investment capital and increase the cost of financing.\nThere is no guarantee that the Group will be successful in obtaining required financing going forward.\nThe risks set out are not exhaustive and additional risks and uncertainties may arise or become material in the future. Any of the risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties discussed in this document, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nKey performance indicators\nThe Group is not yet producing oil and gas and so has no income. Consequently, the Group is not expected to report profits until it disposes of or is able to profitably develop or otherwise turn to account its exploration projects. The Board monitors the activities and performance of the Group on a regular basis and uses both financial and non-financial indicators to assess the Group's performance.\nFollowing the loss of the company's principal asset, its 20% interest in Barryroe Field, the key performance indicator is to be awarded compensation for this loss, as is being pursued through arbitration under Energy Charter Treaty.\nOther information and explanations\nOil and Gas Interests\nThe Group has interests in the following Licence in Irish waters:\nLicense\nInterest\nOperator\nHelvick Lease Undertaking\n9%\nBarryroe Offshore Energy PLC\nBarryroe exploration licence\nThe Group no longer holds interest in the Barryroe exploration licence due to the refusal of the lease undertaking.\nOn 19 May 2023, Barryroe Offshore Energy received a letter from the Irish Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (\"DECC\") advising that Eamon Ryan, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (the \"Minister\") was unwilling to grant the Lease Undertaking, as sought, on grounds of financial capability. DECC also confirmed in the letter that the application was satisfactory from a technical perspective.\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group fully impaired the intangible assets and released the related decommissioning provision associated with the Barryroe exploration licence.\nNotes\nIrish Licensing regime:\nLicensing Option\nGives the holder an exclusive right to apply for an Exploration Licence:\n(a)\nfor a defined period\n(b)\nin return for undertaking an agreed work programme\nExploration Licence\nA \"Standard\" licence covers an agreed work programme in water less than 200metres deep. The work programme usually includes an exploration well. The licence period is six years.\nLease Undertaking\nGives the holder an exclusive right to apply for an Petroleum Lease:\n(a)\nfor a defined period\n(b)\nin return for undertaking an agreed work programme\nSection 172 Statement\nThe board of directors is collectively responsible for the Company's strategy and confirms that during 2024 and subsequently, it has acted in accordance with section 172 (1) of the 2006 Companies Act, which requires the board to promote the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of shareholders.\nSome of the key decisions taken by the directors during the year under review included:\n\u00b7\nContinuing to work with legal advisers to pursue compensation from Ireland for the refusal to award a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe Field, as catered for under the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\u00b7\nCorresponding with the Irish authorities to give notice of the ECTArbitration process.\n\u00b7\nThe purpose of this process is to seek fair value for our shareholders for the loss of the Barryroe asset.\n\u00b7\nA number of potential targets for a reverse takeover were reviewed. A suitable target was selected. The reverse takeover proposal is designed to introduce a new asset into the Company and enhance shareholder value.\nThe Company has continued to maintain and strengthen positive relationships with its joint venture partners, suppliers, and service providers, all of whom remain committed to continuing the business relationship.\nAt all times the Company has worked to minimise any impact of its activities upon the environment and over the years has spent considerable time and effort working with the communities impacted by its operations off the south coast of Ireland.\nThe Company prides itself on its high standards of business conduct and continued to uphold these standards throughout 2024, with no adverse media coverage or significant complaints from shareholders, customers, or suppliers.\nGiven the small nature of the Company's team, with one employee and two other Directors, any issues arising between members are dealt with quickly and fairly.\nDr S A R Boldy\nDirector\nDIRECTORS' REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nThe directors present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe corporate governance statement set out on pages 11 to 13 forms part of this report.\nResults and dividends\nThe results for the year are set out on page 20.\nNo dividends were declared or paid for the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: \u00a3NIL). The directors do not recommend payment of a further dividend.\nDirectors\nThe directors who held office during the year and up to the date of signature of the financial statements were as follows:\nMr J D Auld\nDr S A R Boldy\nMr J D H McKeown\nDirectors\nIn accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, Directors retire and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Stephen Boldy has a service contract with an unexpired notice period of one year. Details of the remuneration of the Directors and the interests of the Directors in the share capital and share options of the Company are disclosed in the Remuneration Report included on pages 14 to 15.\nDetails of executive director and company secretary\nDr Stephen Boldy (Chief Executive Officer),\naged 69, joined Ramco Energy plc in March 2003, becoming CEO of Lansdowne in April 2006. From 1980 to 1984, Dr Boldy worked as a petroleum geologist for the Petroleum Affairs Division of the Department of Energy in Dublin and then spent almost 19 years with Amerada Hess Corporation, where his appointments included UK Exploration Manager and International Exploration Manager. Dr Boldy has extensive experience of working Irish offshore basins and the basins west of Britain and earned his PhD in geology from Trinity College Dublin.\nDetails of non executive directors\nJeffrey Auld*\u2020 (Non-Executive Chaiman), aged 59, has more than 35 years of financial and commercial experience in upstream oil and gas development and production. He is currently the President and CEO of Serinus Energy Limited, a private oil and gas company. His career has involved periods working for exploration and production companies - Premier Oil, PetroKazakhstan and Equator Exploration; as well as periods spent in financial institutions - Goldman Sachs, Canaccord Genuity and Macquarie. He was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Lansdowne Oil & Gas plc in September 2013 and took over as Chairman in 2021.\nDaniel McKeown*\u2020 (Non-Executive Director), aged 43, graduated with a BA Economics & Political Science from the University of Dublin, Trinity College and a Dipl\u00f4me de Grande Ecole (Commerce), Msc. in Management Science and Diplom-Kaufmann from ESCP Europe, Paris. He has more than 20 years of financial, commercial and operational experience in upstream oil and gas, corporate financing and principal investing. Daniel is a Senior Partner at Jordan Associates, having worked for Goldman Sachs, Perella Weinberg, Egerton Energy and Azinam Ltd. He was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Lansdowne Oil & Gas plc in September 2021.\n* A member of the Audit Committee\n\u2020 A member of the Remuneration Committee\nPolitical donations\nNo political donations or expenditure were incurred during 2024.\nFinancial instruments\nRisk exposures and financial risk management policies and objectives are discussed in note 21 to the financial statements.\nResearch and development\nThe company was not involved in any research and development work in 2024.\nEmployee involvement\nThe company has only one employee, who is also the Chief Executive Officer and is thus fully engaged in all of the Company's activities.\nPost reporting date events\nThe Directors are not aware of any event or circumstance which has not been dealt with in note 30 to the financial statements.\nFuture developments\nThe Group's future outlook is described in the Chairman's Statement on pages 1 to 2\nThe Group's main prospect is in the appraisal stage and does not contain any proven reserves.\nThe Group continues to raise funds through placings to finance legal costs associated with arbitration claims following the refusal of the lease undertaking for the Barryroe field. The Company is also progressing towards completing a reverse takeover and securing admission to AIM.\nAuditor\nIn accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the appointment of PKF Littlejohn LLP as auditor of the Group is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\nCorporate governance\nThe Company's statement on corporate governance can be found in the corporate governance report of these financial statements on pages 11 to 13 . The corporate governance report forms part of this director's report and is incorporated into it by cross-reference.\nStreamlined energy and carbon reporting (\"SECR\")\nThe Company operates within the oil and gas appraisal and exploration sector in the Celtic Sea region. During the reporting period, the Company did not operate any physical plant or undertake activities that would result in significant direct environmental emissions.\nEnergy consumption for the year remained well below the 40,000 kWh threshold, and the Company's operations were limited to office-based activities and preliminary exploration assessments. As such, Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are considered to be minimal, and Scope 3 emissions, where applicable, are similarly negligible.\nGiven the limited scale and nature of its operations, the environmental impact of the Company's activities is expected to be minimal and significantly under the thresholds requiring formal carbon reporting or alignment with specific disclosure frameworks.\nStatement of directors' responsibilities\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors must prepare the group and company financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International accounting Standards and\n\u00b7\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n\u00b7\nstate whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nmake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and\n\u00b7\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and company will continue in business.\nThe directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group's and company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006.\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nStatement of disclosure to auditor\nThe directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to access the group and company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\nEach of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Directors' Report section of the annual report, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\u00b7\nThe group and company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the group; and\n\u00b7\nThe Directors' report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group and company, together with description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\nIn the case of each director in office at the date the Directors' report is approved:\n\u00b7\nso far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the group's and company's auditors are unaware; and\n\u00b7\nThey have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the group and the company's auditors are aware of that information.\nThis confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have considered the various matters and have concluded that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and Company to continue as a going concern. These uncertainties relate to the ability to secure compensation for the loss of the Barryroe asset through the ECT process and the ability to complete the planned Reverse Take Over and associated fund-raising.\nNevertheless, after making enquiries and considering the uncertainties, the Directors consider that it is appropriate to adopt a going concern assumption in preparing these financial statements for the reasons outlined in note 1.3 to the financial statements.\nSubstantial shareholders\nThe Directors have been notified of the following interests in 3 per cent or more of the Company's issued share capital at 31 December 2024 and 28 July 2025:\n31-Dec-24\n28-Jul-25\nNo. of Shares\n% of Capital\nNo. of Shares\n% of Capital\nLampe Conway & Co./ LC Capital Master Fund Limited\n171,241,938\n12.29%\n171,241,938\n12.29%\nSpreadex\n145,856,227\n10.47%\n145,856,227\n10.47%\nBrandon Hill Capital\n100,671,158\n7.22%\n100,671,158\n7.22%\nCantor Fitzgerald Europe\n65,090,894\n4.67%\n65,090,894\n4.67%\nBrian McMaster\n56,000,000\n4.02%\n56,000,000\n4.02%\nOliver Stansfield\n55,000,000\n3.95%\n55,000,000\n3.95%\nMr Mark Ward\n49,894,794\n3.58%\n49,894,794\n3.58%\nThe Directors are not aware of any other holding of 3% or more of the share capital of the Company.\nOn behalf of the board\nMr J D Auld\nDirector\nDr S A R Boldy\nDirector\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nIntroduction:\nThe directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance. The Company has adopted the QCA Code, which the directors consider appropriate for a company of its size and nature. The QCA takes key elements of good governance and allows companies to apply them in a manner which is appropriate for the differing needs of small companies. The \"Comply or Explain\" maxim allows companies to inform shareholders where policies differ from the norm and why. The details of the Company's policies in this respect are set out in its AIM Notice 50 Statement, which can be downloaded from the Company's website at www.lansdowneoilandgas.com/company/corporate-governance/.\nDirectors\nAt 31 December 2024, the Board comprised of one Non-Executive Chairman, one Executive Director and one Non-Executive Director. Biographies of the Directors are presented on pages 7 to 10. Jeffrey Auld is the senior Non- Executive Director and Chairman.\nBoard Meeting Attendance Record\n2024\n2024 Eligible Attended\n2023\n2023 Eligible Attended\nS A R Boldy\n06\n06\n17\n17\nJ Auld\n06\n06\n17\n17\nD McKeown\n06\n06\n17\n17\nThe Board is responsible for setting overall Group strategy, policy, monitoring Group performance and authorising significant transactions.\nThe Board meets not less than four times a year and has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. All Directors have full and timely access to information and may take independent professional advice at the Group's expense.\nThe Board has two standing committees with terms of reference as follows:\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee comprises Jeffrey Auld (Chairman) and Daniel McKeown. It determines the terms of engagement of the Group's auditors and, in consultation with the auditors, the scope of the audit. The Audit Committee receives and reviews reports from management and the Group's auditors relating to the interim and annual financial statements and the accounting and internal control systems in the Group. The Audit Committee has unrestricted access to, and oversees, the relationship with the Group's auditors, PKF Littlejohn LLP (\"PKF\"). The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and meets with the Group's auditors at least once a year. Other directors may attend by invitation.\nThe Audit Committee approved the reappointment of PKF Littlejohn LLP (\"PKF\") as the Group's external auditor.\nThe independent auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the financial statements. They review and test the systems of internal financial control and data contained in the financial statements to the extent necessary to express their audit opinion. They discuss with management the reporting of operational results and the financial position of the Group and present their findings to the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee reviews the independence and objectivity of the independent auditors. The Committee reviews the nature and amount of non-audit work undertaken by PKF each year to satisfy itself that there is no effect on their independence. Details of this year's fees are given in note 6 to the accounts. The Committee is satisfied that PKF is independent.\nThe Group does not have an internal audit function but the need for such a function is reviewed at least annually. It is the current view of the Board that an internal audit function is not required given the size and nature of the operations of the Group.\nRemuneration Committee\nThe Remuneration Committee comprises Jeffrey Auld (Chairman), Daniel McKeown. It reviews the scale and structure of the Executive Directors' remuneration and the terms of their service or employment contracts, including share option schemes and other bonus arrangements. The remuneration and terms and conditions of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the entire Board. No Director or manager of the Group may participate in any meeting at which discussion or any decision regarding their own remuneration takes place. The Remuneration Committee also administers any share option schemes or other employee incentive schemes adopted by the Company from time to time.\nThe Remuneration Report is presented on pages 14 to 15 and contains a statement of remuneration policy and details of the remuneration of each Director.\nRisk management and internal control\nThe Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. Management identify risks, the likelihood of those risks occurring, the impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to manage and mitigate those risks to an acceptable level. This process is reviewed by the Board annually and accords with guidance on internal control. It has been in place throughout the year under review and up to the date of this report.\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal financial control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets. Such a system can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and correctly recorded, and that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be detected within a timely period. The system, which has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of this report, comprises the following main elements, all of which are reviewed by the Board:\n\u2022 An organisation structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority.\n\u2022 Appointment of employees of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities.\n\u2022 Established procedures for budgeting and capital expenditure.\n\u2022 Monthly reporting of actual performance compared to budget, reviewed by the Board quarterly.\n\u2022 Rolling monthly forecasts for the financial year.\n\u2022 The Group reports to shareholders on a half-yearly basis to ensure timely reporting of financial results.\nInvestor relations\nCommunications with investors are given high priority. The Group keeps its institutional shareholders up to date with its business and objectives, and obtains their views on the Group, by means of periodic presentations. Additionally, the Group is ready to respond appropriately to particular issues or questions that may be raised by investors. All shareholders are sent the Annual Report and financial statements, the Interim Report and can also elect to receive all press releases, many choosing to receive this information by e-mail.\nThe Group has a website, www.lansdowneoilandgas.com, which is regularly updated and contains a wide range of information about the Group including the previous Annual Reports and press releases. The Board views the AGM as an opportunity to communicate with private investors and encourages them to attend. The Board aims to ensure that the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions. Shareholders are invited to ask questions and are given the opportunity to meet the Directors informally following the meeting. The Company complies with best practice in ensuring that the Notice of the AGM is dispatched to shareholders at least 21 days ahead of the meeting.\nOn behalf of the board\nDr S A R Boldy\nDirector\nREMUNERATION REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nIntroduction\nThe following report details how the Company's remuneration committee determines Directors' remuneration packages through the application of the Company's remuneration policy.\nRemuneration Committee\nThe members of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) are Jeffrey Auld (Chairman) and Daniel McKeown, who are Non-Executive Directors of the Company.\nThe Committee, which meets at least twice each year, is responsible to the Board for determining the terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors and their remuneration packages (including pension rights and any compensation payments) and oversees the operation of the Company's Employee Share Option Scheme.\nThe Committee has access to external independent professional advice, at the Company's expense, as the Committee sees fit. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided by the Committee or any conflicts arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.\nRemuneration Policy\nThe Group operates in the international oil and gas industry and aims to attract, reward, motivate and retain top executives in a manner appropriate to that industry and with the objective of long term accumulation of value for shareholders. The remuneration packages currently being offered are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of performance related and non-performance related remuneration designed to incentivise Directors. The packages are in line with industry norms.\nDirectors' Service Contracts\nStephen A R Boldy has a service contract with the Company with a rolling notice period of one year.\nThe remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board after consideration of appropriate external comparisons and the responsibilities and time involvement of individual Directors. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.\nDirectors' Remuneration Package\nThe executive Directors' remuneration package, which is reviewed annually, consist of annual salary, performance related bonuses, health and other benefits, pension contributions and share options.\nStephen A R Boldy is entitled to an annual bonus equal to 2 per cent of the audited consolidated after tax profits of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to a cap equal to his annual salary during the relevant financial year. He is also entitled to bonus payments on the entering into of binding agreements with third parties in respect of any farm-out arrangements relating to the Group's assets, with a requirement to utilise any such bonus payments to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of the Company.\nDirectors' Detailed Emoluments\nSalary and Fees\nPerformance related bonus\nBenefits\nPension Contributions\n2024 Total\n2023 Total\nExecutive Directors\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nS A R Boldy\n64\n-\n-\n-\n64\n62\nNon-Executive Directors\nD McKeown\n21\n-\n-\n-\n21\n18\nJ Auld\n16\n-\n-\n-\n16\n25\nas at 31 Dec 2024\n101\n-\n-\n-\n101\nas at 31 Dec 2023\n105\n-\n-\n-\n105\nInterests in Shares\nThe beneficial interests of the Directors who held office at 31 December 2024 in the ordinary shares of the Company are as follows:\nAt 31 Dec 2024\nAt 31 Dec 2023\nS A R Boldy\n6,400,660\n6,400,660\nJ Auld\n3,828,619\n3,828,619\nTotal\n10,229,279\n10,229,279\nOn behalf of the board\nMr J D Auld\nDirector\nDr S A R Boldy\nDirector\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT\nTO THE MEMBERS OF LANSDOWNE OIL & GAS PLC\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of Lansdowne Oil & Gas Plc (the 'parent company') for the year ended 31 December 2024 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Company Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nIn our opinion:\n\u2022 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2024 and of group's loss for the year then ended;\n\u2022 the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards; and\n\u2022 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 1.3 in the financial statements, which indicates that the Group incurred a net loss of \u00a3336k during the year ended 31 December 2024, and as of that date, the Group was in a net liability position of \u00a31.274 million. As stated in note 1.3, following the refusal of the Irish Minister at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to award a Lease Undertaking for the Barryoe oil and gas field, the Company is pursuing compensation via the Energy Charter Treaty. Discussions between the Company's legal advisors and third-party litigation funders have been ongoing but there can be no guarantee that an agreement will be reached. The Company has been working since the second half of 2024 on a Reverse Take Over to acquire a new asset that has the potential to create additional value. A fund-raising is planned to accompany the completion of the Reverse Take Over. The ability of the Group and Company to continue as a going concern, therefore relies upon successful future equity fund-raising and continued support from the holder of the Company's loan note. As stated in note 29, several convertible loan notes were issued to various individuals post year end 31 December 2024 with the intention of funding the Group's operations for the forthcoming 12 months. These events and conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following audit procedures:\n\u2022 reviewing cashflow forecasts and budgets provided by management covering a period up to December 2026 as well as challenging the accompanying key assumptions;\n\u2022 evaluating management's plans for future actions in relation to its going concern assessment and determining whether the management's plans are feasible in the circumstances;\n\u2022 reviewing sensitised cash flow forecasts provided by the management which depict the management's plans for expenditures in the event of no additional fund raising being completed during the forecast period;\n\u2022 reviewing post year-end spend and ascertaining the latest financial position; and\n\u2022 considering the adequacy of the disclosures and accounting policies in the financial statements.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOur application of materiality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. The quantitative and qualitative thresholds for materiality determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures. Group materiality was set at \u00a36,000 based on 2% of total expenses (2023: Group materiality set at \u00a322,000 based on 5% of adjusted loss). Group performance materiality was set at 50% of overall materiality (2023: 60% of overall materiality). Performance materiality of the parent company was set at \u00a32,850 (2023: \u00a312,130). Performance materiality of the parent company was capped at 95% (2023: 93%) of group performance materiality to ensure adequate audit evidence was obtained over the parent company financial statements in relation to the Group.\nThe Group remains in the pre-production phase for oil and gas, with no income generated and continuous losses incurred. Following the historical recognition of impairment losses on intangible assets related to Barryroe exploration costs, gross assets or net assets benchmarks are deemed inappropriate. Given the ongoing losses, we believe that total expenses is the most relevant benchmark for assessing materiality.\nWe agreed with the audit committee that we would report all audit differences identified during our audit in excess of \u00a3300 (2023: \u00a31,100) as well as those that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\nOur approach to the audit\nIn designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Our audit is risk based and is designed to focus our efforts on the areas at greatest risk of material misstatement, aspects subject to significant management judgement as well as greatest complexity, risk and size. An audit of the financial information of the Group's material components which, for the year ended 31 December 2024, were located in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Following our materiality and risk assessments, we concluded that one component was significant enough to warrant a full scope audit of their financial information. Instead, analytical procedures were performed at the Group level for two components.\nKey audit matters\nExcept for the matter described in the material uncertainty related to going concern section, we have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u2022\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u2022\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u2022 adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u2022 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or \u2022 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u2022 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n\u2022 We obtained an understanding of the group and parent company and the sector in which they operate to identify laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the financial statements. We obtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with management, as well as the application of cumulative audit knowledge and experience of the sector.\n\u2022 We determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to the group and parent company in this regard to be those arising from the Companies Act 2006, UK adopted international accounting standards, AIM regulations, General Data Protection Regulations.\n\u2022 We designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit team considered whether there were any indications of non-compliance by the group and the parent company with those laws and regulations. These procedures included, but were not limited to specific enquiries of management, reviewing board minutes, reviewing Regulatory News Service (RNS) announcements and any legal or regulatory compliance correspondence.\n\u2022 We also identified the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. We considered, in addition to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of controls, whether key accounting estimates and judgements could include management bias. We addressed these risks by challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management when auditing significant accounting estimates. Critical judgements in the financial statements included the key assumptions within the going concern assessment.\n\u2022 As with all of our audits, we addressed the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit procedures which included but were not limited to: the testing of journals and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business, as well as discussions with management where relevant.\n\u2022 In our audit procedures, we have considered matters with non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud at group and component levels. We have performed audit procedures on all material components within the group.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nWendy Liang (Senior Statutory Auditor) For and on behalf of PKF Littlejohn LLP\nStatutory Auditor\n15 Westferry Circus Canary Wharf London E14 4HD\nGROUP STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n2024\n2024\n2023\n2023\nNotes\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nEmployee benefits expense\n8\n101\n105\nImpairment charge\n13\n-\n16,396\nOther operating expenses\n193\n300\nTotal operating expenses\n(294)\n(16,801)\nOperating loss\n(294)\n(16,801)\nFinance costs\n9\n(52)\n(54)\nOther gains and losses\n10\n10\n512\nLoss before taxation\n(336)\n(16,343)\nIncome tax expense\n11\n-\n-\nLoss and total comprehensive expense\nfor the year\n(336)\n(16,343)\nLoss per share 12 Pence per share\nBasic/Diluted loss per ordinary share (0.02p)\n(1.53p)\nLoss for the financial year is all attributable to the owners of the parent company.\nTotal comprehensive expense for the year is all attributable to the owners of the parent company.\n(Company registration number 05662495, England and Wales)\nGROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2024\n2024\n2023\nas restated\nASSETS\nNotes\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n16\n-\n5\nCash and cash equivalents\n11\n24\n11\n29\nTotal Assets\n11\n29\nEQUITY\nCalled up Share capital\n25\n9,175\n9,159\nShare premium account (as restated)\n26\n31,899\n31,787\nWarrants Reserve\n28\n115\n115\nConvertible Loan Reserve\n27\n45\n-\nRetained earnings\n(42,508)\n(42,172)\nTotal Equity\n(1,274)\n(1,111)\nLIABILITIES\nNon-Current liabilities\nDerivative Financial Liability\n29\n27\n-\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n22\n173\n107\nBorrowings\n18\n1,085\n1,033\n(1,258)\n(1,140)\nTotal Liabilities\n1,285\n1,140\nTotal equity and Liabilities\n11\n29\nThe financial statements were approved by the board of directors and authorised for issue and are signed on its behalf by:\nMr J D Auld\nDirector\nDr S A R Boldy\nDirector\nCOMPANY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2024\n2024\n2023\nas restated\nASSETS\nNotes\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n16\n-\n5\nCash and cash equivalents\n11\n24\n11\n29\nTotal Assets\n11\n29\nEQUITY\nCalled up Share capital\n25\n9,175\n9,159\nShare premium account (as restated)\n26\n31,899\n31,787\nWarrants Reserve\n28\n115\n115\nConvertible Loan Reserve\n27\n45\n-\nRetained earnings\n(42,508)\n(42,172)\nTotal Equity\n(1,274)\n(1,111)\nLIABILITIES\nNon-Current liabilities\nDerivative Financial Liability\n29\n27\n-\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n22\n173\n107\nBorrowings\n18\n1,085\n1,033\n(1,258)\n(1,140)\nTotal Liabilities\n1,285\n1,140\nTotal equity and Liabilities\n11\n29\nAs permitted by s408 Companies Act 2006, the company has not presented its own income statement and related notes.

The registered office is C/O Pinsent Masons Llp, 30 Crown Place, London, EC2A 4ES. The company's principal activities and nature of its operations are disclosed in the directors' report.\nThe group consists of Lansdowne Oil and Gas Plc and all of its subsidiaries.\nThe Company's shares are quoted on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.\n1.1\nAccounting convention\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK International Accounting Standards (UK IASs) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, except as otherwise stated. A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.\nThe financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the group. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousands.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as otherwise stated. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.\n1.2\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the results of Lansdowne Oil & Gas plc and its subsidiary undertakings, made up to 31 December each year. No separate income statement is presented for the parent company, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Lansdowne Oil & Gas plc. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. This control is normally evidenced when Lansdowne Oil & Gas plc owns, either directly or indirectly, more than 50 per cent of the voting rights or potential voting rights of a company's share capital. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full.\nJoint arrangements\nThe Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties. A joint arrangement is classified as a joint operation or as a joint venture, depending on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.\nThe classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group's share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Group's investment and share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement respectively.\n1.3\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have carried out a detailed assessment of the Group's current and prospective activities, its relationship with the holder of its loan note, and have prepared cash flow projections for the period up to 31 December 2026. The following represent the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections. The Company is pursuing two value creating opportunities:\nBarryroe Oil and Gas field - Compensation claim\nAs has been explained, following the refusal of the Irish Minister at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to award a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe oil and gas field, Lansdowne is pursuing compensation via the Energy Charter Treaty.\nThe results of the Competent Person Report carried out by RPS (\"RPS CPR\") announced in February 2022, addressing simply the first phase of a Barryroe development and solely the Basal Wealden Oil reservoir, concluded that the P50 volumes were estimated at 81.2 million barrels of oil recoverable gross (16.24 million barrels net to Lansdowne) from a Best Estimate of 278 million barrels of oil in place (STOIIP).\nAn economic evaluation, documented in the RPS CPR, covering the Phase 1 development and in the 2C oil resources case, delivers an NPV10% for Lansdowne's 20% share of $104 million (\u00a377.6 million at current exchange rate) under a Brent Oil Price assumption of US$68 per barrel in 2027, rising to $70/bbl in 2028 and 2029 and inflated at 2% per annum thereafter. The price of Brent Oil stands currently at c. $65/bbl, broadly in line with that modelled.\nThe RPS CPR has only addressed the oil in the Basal Wealden A Sand, which allows it to be correlated to the earlier work carried out by Netherland Sewell and Associates Inc.\nGas was proven in the Basal Wealden C Sand reservoir in the 48/24-10z well that overlays the oil reservoir and this has previously been estimated to hold a potential gas resource of c 400 BCF GIIP. Lansdowne believes this significant gas resource could make a vitally important contribution to Ireland's energy mix as it transitions to a zero net carbon economy and it is anticipated that any future phased development programme will include consideration of this important gas resource.\nGiven the above, the quantum of the Company's claim is well in excess of $100 million (\u00a375 million).\nThe Company has appointed legal advisers to proceed with this claim, and it is likely that the matter will be brought before an international court of arbitration.\nThe Directors believe that the outcome of the legal proceedings is likely to be favourable, based on legal advice received and the merits of the Company's claim.\nThe Company's legal advisers are in dialogue with potential third-party litigation funders, who are being sought to provide the bulk of the necessary legal costs. These discussions are at an advanced stage, but there can be no guarantee that an agreement will be reached.\nReverse Take Over\nOne of the critical path items for progressing the Reverse Take Over is for the Company to complete the audit of its 2023 and 2024 Annual Accounts.\nThe 2023 Accounts were signed off on 11 June 2025 and the 2024 Accounts are presented here.\nAll the other documents to compete the Reverse Take Over are at an advanced stage.\nA fund-raising is planned to accompany the completion of the Reverse Take Over and the process of re-admission of the Company's shares to trading on AIM and this is expected to take place in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe ability of the Group and the Company to continue as a going concern, therefore relies upon successful future equity fund-raising and continued support from the holder of the Company's loan note.\nAdditional funds of \u00a3180,000 have been raised in late 2024 and in 2025 through Convertible Loan Notes to support the company whilst pursuing the above opportunities and the Company's broker, Tavira Securities, is in the process of putting in place additional Convertible Loan Notes.\nThe Directors have considered the matters set out above and have concluded that a material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt on the ability of the Group and Company to continue as a going concern.\nNevertheless, after making enquiries and considering the uncertainties described above, The Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. These financial statements do not include any adjustment that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.\n1.4\nIntangible assets other than goodwill\nOil and gas intangible exploration/appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment - development/ producing assets\nAll expenditure relating to oil and gas activities is capitalised in accordance with the \"successful efforts\" method of accounting, as described in IFRS 6. The Group's policy for oil and gas assets is also compliant with IFRS 6 \"Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources\". Under this standard, the Group's exploration and appraisal activities are capitalised as intangible assets and its development and production activities are capitalised within \"Property, plant and equipment\".\nAll costs incurred prior to the acquisition of licences are expensed immediately to the income statement.\nLicence acquisition costs, geological and geophysical costs and the direct costs of exploration and appraisal are initially capitalised as intangible assets, pending determination of the existence of commercial reserves in the licence area. Such costs are classified as intangible assets based on the nature of the underlying asset, which does not yet have any proven physical substance. Exploration and appraisal costs are held, un-depleted, until such a time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered. If commercial reserves are determined to exist and the technical feasibility of extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration/appraisal costs are first subjected to an impairment test (see below) and the resulting carrying value is transferred to the development and producing assets category within property, plant and equipment. If no commercial reserves exist, then that particular exploration/appraisal effort was \"unsuccessful\" and the costs are written off to the income statement in the period in which the evaluation is made. The success or failure of each exploration/appraisal effort is judged on a field by field basis.\nAll costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development/producing assets on a field by field basis. Development expenditure comprises all costs incurred in bringing a field to commercial production, including financing costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset.\nNet proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs. Any surplus proceeds are credited to the income statement. Net proceeds from any disposal of exploration assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost. A gain or loss on disposal of an exploration asset is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.\nUpon commencement of production, capitalised costs will be amortised on a unit of production basis which is calculated to write off the expected cost of each asset over its life in line with the depletion of proved and probable reserves.\nAssets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net realisable value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. These cash-generating units (\"CGUs\") are aligned to the business unit and sub-business unit structure the Group uses to manage its business. Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use.\n1.5\nNon-current investments\nInterests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The investments are assessed for impairment at each reporting date and any impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the parent company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\nAn associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, in which the group holds a long-term interest and has significant influence. The group considers that it has significant influence where it has the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the associate.\nEntities in which the group has a long term interest and shares control under a contractual arrangement are classified as jointly controlled entities.\nShares in Group undertakings are held at cost less impairment provisions. Impairments occur where the recoverable value of the investment is less than its carrying value. The recoverable value of the investment is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash flows of the investee.\n1.6\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.\n1.7\nFinancial Instruments\nNon-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. Interest- bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n1.8\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are recognised in the group's statement of financial position when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are classified into specified categories, depending on the nature and purpose of the financial assets.\nAt initial recognition, financial assets classified as fair value through profit and loss are measured at fair value and any transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets not classified as fair value through profit and loss are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs.\nFinancial assets held at amortised cost\nFinancial instruments are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. They arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers (eg trade receivables). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment where necessary.\nImpairment of financial assets\nFinancial assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.\nThe expected credit losses associated with these assets are estimated on a forward-looking basis. A broad range of information is considered when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument.\nDerecognition of financial assets\nFinancial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n1.9\nFinancial liabilities\nThe group recognises financial debt when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. Financial liabilities are classified as either 'financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss' or 'other financial liabilities'.\nOther financial liabilities\nOther financial liabilities, including borrowings, trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of the financial liability. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For the purposes of each financial liability, interest expense includes initial transaction costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the group's obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.\n1.10 Equity instruments\nEquity instruments issued by the parent company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs,allocated between share capital and share premium. Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer payable at the discretion of the company.\nConvertible Loan Note\nInitial Recognition\nThe convertible loan note is initially recognised by separating it into the host contract and the embedded derivative. The embedded derivative is measured at fair value at initial recognition. The value of the host contract is determined as the difference between the proceeds received (net of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of the instrument) and the fair value of the embedded derivative\n.\nSubsequent Measurement\n\u2022 Equity Component (Host Contract):\nAfter initial recognition, the equity component of the convertible loan is measured at the residual amount of the transaction price less the fair value of the conversion feature. The host contract is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates.\n\u2022 Embedded Derivative Liability:\nThe embedded derivative is measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo-based option pricing model. Changes in fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss, and the derivative is remeasured at each reporting date.\nConversion\n\u2022 Equity Component (Host Contract):\nUpon conversion, the carrying amount of the equity component is transferred to share capital and share premium, as applicable.\n\u2022 Embedded Derivative Liability:\nThe fair value of the embedded derivative at the date of conversion is transferred to equity, assuming the shares are issued. Any difference between the carrying amount of the derivative and the fair value of the shares issued (number of shares \u00d7 share price at the conversion date) is recognised in profit or loss.\n1.11 Taxation\nCurrent Tax\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n\u00b7\nIn respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will\n\u00b7\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.\nIncome tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.\n1.12 Provisions\nProvision is made for the cost of decommissioning oil and gas wells and other oil field facilities. The cost of decommissioning is determined through discounting the amounts expected to be payable to their present value at the date the provision is recorded and this calculation is re-assessed at each reporting date. This amount is included within development and production assets by licence area and the liability is included in provisions. The cost will be depleted over the life of the licence area on a unit of production basis and charged to the Income Statement. The unwinding of the discount is reflected as a finance cost in the income statement over the expected remaining life of the well.\n1.13 Foreign Currency\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the Company's functional currency. The assessment of functional currency has been based on the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates and in which its costs arise. These financial statements have been presented in Sterling.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All exchange gains and losses are taken to the income statement.\n1.14 Warrants\nThe Group classifies instruments issued as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms of the instruments. The warrants issued (as outlined in note 28) are derivative in nature and are classified as equity.\n1.15 Operating segments\nThe Chief Executive monitors the operating results of its operating segment for the purposes of making decisions and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is reviewed consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Because the Group does not engage yet in business activities from which it may earn revenue, and as all its developmental activities are currently located in one geographical area, no reportable segment has been identified nor disclosed in these financial statements.\n1.16 Finance income and expenses\nInterest income and interest payable is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Finance expenses comprise interest on leased assets, unwinding of any discount on provisions, fair value movement of warrants, and foreign exchange movements in the retranslation of non-sterling denominated liabilities.\n2\nAdoption of new and revised standards and changes in accounting policies\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\").\nThe IFRSs applied by the company in the preparation of these financial statements are those that were effective on or before 31 December 2024.\nThe following standards, amendments and interpretations which became effective from 1 January 2024 are of relevance to the company:\n\u00b7\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nStandards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the company:\n\u00b7\nLack of Exchangeability - Amendments to IAS 21\n(The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)\nThe effective date for all the above being 1 January 2025.\nIn the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group and Company did not early adopt any new or amended standards and do not plan to early adopt any of the standards issued but not yet effective.\nThere would not have been a material impact on the financial statements if these standards had been applied in the current year.\n3\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nIn the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nThe estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are outlined below.\nCritical judgements\nGoing concern (policy (1.3) above)\nAddition to critical accounting estimates and judgments note 3\nJudgement Applied in Classification of Derivative as Equity or Liability\nThe Group issues convertible loans (CLNs) with embedded derivative features, which necessitates significant judgement in determining the classification of the derivative as either equity or a financial liability. This judgement considers the contractual terms of the conversion option, assessing whether the derivative meets the criteria for classification as equity. Where classified as a derivative financial liability (DFL), it is held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), whereas derivatives classified as equity are not remeasured after initial recognition.\nEstimation Applied in Valuation of Derivative Financial Liability\nFor CLNs classified as containing a DFL held at FVTPL, the Group uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the DFL on initial recognition, at each reporting date, and upon conversion events. This approach is deemed appropriate due to the simulation's ability to model a range of possible outcomes, capturing the inherent variability in conversion terms and share price volatility. Key inputs in the Monte Carlo model include the Company's share price, share price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and assumptions regarding the timing and probability of conversion.\nChanges in any of these assumptions may significantly impact the fair value of the derivative liability, potentially resulting in profit or loss variations. Management regularly reassesses these inputs, utilising historical data and market-based assumptions to ensure that the fair value estimation reflects the economic substance of the convertible instrument.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nDeferred tax asset\nDeferred tax assets have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can use the benefits therefrom.\nFurther details of the assumptions used can be found in this statement of accounting policies and in the notes to these financial statements\n4\nRevenue\nThe Group has one reportable operating and geographic segment, which is the exploration for oil and gas reserves in Ireland.

In December\n2023, LC Capital Master Fund Ltd has agreed to extend the term of the loan to 30 June 2024.

The Board approves the use of financial products to manage the Group's exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\na) Credit risk\nCredit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks. The Group's policy is to deposit cash with banks with an 'A' rating or better where possible. 100 per cent of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2024 was held with such banks.\nOther than fully written down impairment of NIL (2023: \u00a3 59,770 ) recognised in respect of receivables from its subsidiaries, the Company has no credit risk associated with its other receivables. See note 31.\nThere are no financial assets which are past due but not impaired at the end of the reporting period.\nThe maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying values as at the reporting date.\nThe group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover this credit risk.\nb) Liquidity risk management\nThe Board regularly reviews rolling cash flow forecasts for the Group and Company.\nFinancial and costs obligations related to the Group and Company's licences will be financed by either reducing its equity interest through new participants farming in, by the raising of new capital, through shareholder loans, or a combination of all three.\nIn December 2023, an extension was granted for the repayment of the LC Capital loan (Note 18), with a new due date of 30 June 2024. Following this, a further extension was approved after June 2024, and discussions regarding the loan repayment terms are still ongoing with company management and a renewed agreement has not been signed as of the date of signing the accounts.\nBased on current forecasts, the Group and Company will need to raise further capital to meet its future obligations. This is reliant upon the assumptions outlined in the Statement of Accounting Policies.\nThere is no difference between the carrying value and the contractually undiscounted cash flows for financial liabilities. At 31 December 2024, all trade and other payables and shareholder loans were due within one year.\nc) Market risk management\nForeign exchange risk\nAlthough the Group reports in Sterling, certain transactions are conducted in Euro. Given the low level of business conducted in Euro during the year, foreign exchange rate fluctuations had an immaterial effect on the result for the year.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises from cash deposits and interest bearing liabilities.\nGiven the low level of average cash balances held by the Group during the year, a 10 per cent increase or decrease in average interest rates would have had an immaterial effect on the loss for the year and impact to interest bearing liabilities.\nd) Capital risk management\nThe group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group defines capital as equity plus shareholder loans.\nThe Group's objective when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for the shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.\nThe Group regularly reviews its capital structure on the basis of its expected capital requirements in order to achieve the defined strategic objectives and manages its capital accordingly.\nThe Group is committed to fully complying with the terms of the loan agreement with LC Capital Master Fund Limited, in order to maintain good cash liquidity a strong relationship with the shareholder.\nThe Group's and Company's financial instruments comprise cash, other receivables and trade payables and shareholder loans due within one year and therefore, management believes that the carrying values of those financial instruments approximate fair value.\ne) Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities\nThe Group's and Company's financial instruments comprise cash, other receivables and trade payables and shareholder loans due within one year and therefore, management believes that the carrying values of those financial instruments approximate fair value.\n22\nTrade and other payables - Groups\nCurrent\n2024\n2023\nNon-\ncurrent\n2024\n2023\nAmounts falling due within one\nyear:\n\u00a3'000\nas\nrestated\n\u00a3'000\nas\nrestated\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTrade\npayables\n71\n44\n-\n-\nAccruals\n74\n55\n-\n-\nSocial security and other taxation Derivative financial liability\n28\n-\n8\n-\n-\n-\n27\n-\n173\n107\n27\n-\n23\nTrade and other payables -\nCompany\nCurrent\nNon-\ncurrent\nAmounts falling due within one\nyear:\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n2023\nas\nrestated\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n2023\nas\nrestated\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTrade\npayables\n71\n44\n-\n-\nAccruals\n74\n55\n-\n-\nSocial security and other taxation Derivative financial liability\n28\n-\n8\n-\n-\n-\n27\n-\n173\n107\n27\n-\n24\nProvisions\nConsequent to the correspondence received from DECC on 19 May 2023, the Group no longer expects to be required to fund the abandonment costs of the Barryroe well .

As a result the fair value of warrant transactions above from (a) to (c) remains NIL as at 31 December 2024.\n29 Convertible loan notes\nAs at 31 December 2024, the fair value of the DFL was as follows:\nGroup and Company\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 January 2024\n-\nInitial recognition\n37\nFair value through income statement\n10\nAt 31 December 2024\n27\nEquity Host Contract\nThe principal (host contract) was issued with the intention for it to be converted into equity upon completion of the RTO. Until that point, both parties intend for the CLNs to remain outstanding indefinitely. The parties do not intend for the principal to be repaid in cash, and therefore the principal is an equity host contract.\nInitial recognition and measurement\nThe value of the host contract is determined as the difference between the proceeds received (net of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of the instrument) and the fair value of the embedded derivative.\nThe equity component is not remeasured and remains within equity unless the instrument is modified or converted.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the fair value of the equity host contract was as follows:\nGroup and Company\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 January 2024\n-\nInitial recognition\n48\nAllocated transaction costs\n(3)\nAt 31 December 2024\n45\n30\nEvents after the reporting date\nIn February 2025 the Company announced the issuing of a further \u00a345,000 of Convertible Loan Notes, arranged by Tavira Financial Limited, the Company's joint broker, to a number of existing shareholders.\nThe Loan terms are the same as those previously entered into and announced on 20 September 2024. The Loan is unsecured, carries no interest and shall be converted into new ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\") at the time of completing a reverse takeover and subject to shareholder approval for the extension of share issuance authorities. The conversion price will be the lower of 0.1 pence (being the share price at the time of suspension on 21 March 2024), or a 20% discount price to the issue price at the time of any issuance of shares alongside a future reverse takeover. At the date of signing of these accounts, the reverse takeover is expected to take place in the third quarter of 2025.\nOn 30 July 2025, the Company announced the issued of a further \u00a3100,000 of Convertible Loan Notes, made under the same terms as the previous issues in September 2024 and February 2025.\nLansdowne used the funds to provide working capital whilst discussions continue with potential funders for Lansdowne's Energy Charter Treaty claim against Ireland and work progresses toward a potential reverse takeover.\nTrading in the Company's shares on AIM remained suspended. Regarding the ECT claim, a large amount of information has been provided to a potential third-party litigation funder that has indicated interest in funding the claim. Again, this is expected to come to fruition in the third quarter 2025. There can however, be no guarantee that such funding will be forthcoming.\nOn 24 July 2025, a financial commitment of approximately \u00a315,000 (USD $20,000) was made to a U.S.-based law firm to progress legal agreements with a prospective third-party litigation funder. The associated costs are being shared among the claimants, with the Company's portion amounting to the above commitment. While there is no certainty of a successful conclusion, the Company is encouraged by this development.\n31\nRelated party transactions\nRemuneration of key management personnel\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nShort-term employee benefits (Salaries)\n101\n105\nOther transactions with related parties\nTransactions with LC Capital Master Fund Ltd\nThe Company has a loan agreement with LC Capital Master Fund Limited, a major shareholder. Warrants were granted to LC Capital Targeted Opportunities Fund. Details of the loan agreement are given in Note 18.\nAmounts due by subsidiaries\nAt 31 December 2024, amounts owed to the Company by its subsidiaries totalled \u00a322 million (2023: \u00a322 million). These amounts have been provided in full in the Company's financial statements as there is no immediate prospect of repayment. Amounts due to the Company are unsecured, non-interest bearing and have no fixed repayment terms.\n32\nPrior period adjustment\nDuring the preparation of the 2024 statutory accounts, the Group management undertook a reconciliation of the share issue costs brought forward from prior year.\nThe reconciliation identified that the share premium in 2023 was overstated by \u00a38k and trade creditors understated by the same amount as a result of the late receipt of invoices.\nManagement resolved to correct the opening share premium account against the prior year's share premium balance. This adjustment ensures that both the share premium and trade creditor balances are appropriately stated in the Company and Group accounts.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company is also nearing completion of its accounts for the full year to 31 December 2024 and these will be announced imminently.\nTrading in the Company's shares on AIM will remain suspended\nuntil the completion of a reverse takeover, which requires the publication of an admission document and the approval of such a transaction at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, or the Company is readmitted to trading on AIM as an investing company.\nLoan terms\nThe Loan terms are the same as those previously entered into and announced on 20 September 2024 and 10 February 2025. The Loans are unsecured, carry no interest and shall be converted into new ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\") at the time of completing a reverse takeover and subject to shareholder approval for the extension of share issuance authorities. The conversion price will be the lower of 0.1 pence (being the share price at the time of suspension on 21 March 2024), or a 20% discount price to the issue price at the time of any issuance of shares alongside a future reverse takeover.\nFor further information please contact:\nLansdowne Oil & Gas plc\nSteve Boldy\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nStuart Gledhill\nCharlie Bouverat\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3192 1739\nJoint Broker\nOliver Stansfield\nNotes to editors:\nAbout Lansdowne\nLansdowne Oil & Gas (LOGP.LN) is an oil and gas exploration and appraisal company focused on the North Celtic Sea and quoted on the AIM market and head quartered in Dublin.\nIn May 2023 the application for a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe Field, in which Lansdowne held a 20% interest, was refused by the Irish Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.\nIn June 2023 Lansdowne announced the commencement of action under the Arbitration Process of the Energy Charter Treaty.\nOn 20 September 2023, Lansdowne announced that, under AIM Rule 15, the Company had been designated to be a cash shell. Accordingly, the shares of the Company were suspended from trading on AIM as at 07.30 am on 21 March 2024 (\"Suspension\").\nFor more information on Lansdowne, please refer to\nwww.lansdowneoilandgas.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
