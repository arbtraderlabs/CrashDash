If you have any queries on this, then please contact Steve Boldy, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (responsible for arranging release of this announcement).\n8 March 2024\nLansdowne Oil & Gas plc\n(\"Lansdowne\" or the \"Company\")\nEnergy Charter Treaty Claim Distribution Plan\n\u00b7\nRecord date of Registered Shareholders of the Company expected to be set as 21 March 2024 (date of Suspension)\n\u00b7\nRegistered Shareholders at the record date planned to be protected beneficiaries of the outcome of the Arbitration process\nFurther to the update provided on 26 February 2024, the Company is focused upon progressing its Energy Charter Treaty claim (\"ECT Claim\") against Ireland following the refusal to award a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe oil and gas field (\"Barryroe\").\nOn 20 September 2023 Lansdowne announced that, under Rule 15 of the AIM Rules for Companies (\"AIM Rules\"), the Company had been designated to be a cash shell. Accordingly, given that the Company does not expect to undertake acquisition, or acquisitions, which constitutes a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules (\"Reverse Takeover\") ahead of the six-month suspension window, the Company's shares will be suspended from trading on AIM as at 7.30 am on 21 March 2024 (\"Suspension\").\nIt is the intention of the Board of Directors that, in the event of a successful ECT claim outcome against Ireland by the Company and/or its subsidiary Lansdowne Celtic Sea Limited (together the \"Claimants\"), arrangements will be put in place in advance to ensure that qualifying shareholders will receive an economic benefit relating to their shareholding at the date of Suspension, ensuring that should there be any future changes in the capital structure of the Company, the impact on such shareholders vis a vis as beneficiaries of a successful ECT Claim, will be ring fenced.\nThe Board of Directors intend that such arrangements will account for all or a proportion of the net proceeds of a successful ECT Claim outcome (after deduction of the reasonable legal and ancillary costs associated with the ECT claim), including the use by the Company of potential proceeds from the ECT Claim as an asset\n, which may prove valuable for any future transactions including a Reverse Takeover. If the Company does complete a Reverse Takeover during the six-month period following Suspension, this would lead to the lifting of the Suspension.\nIt should be cautioned that there is no guarantee that the Claimants will be successful in the ECT Claim. Moreover, in the event the Barryroe licence is reinstated, potentially leading to the ECT Claim being subsequently withdrawn, the Company's full economic interest in Barryroe will remain with the Company.\nThe Company is taking further tax, legal and regulatory advice and will make further announcements as appropriate.\nSteve Boldy, CEO of Lansdowne, commented:\n'We believe the actions of the Irish Government are wholly inappropriate and the Company is therefore electing to preserve its interests under the Energy Charter Treaty. We believe it is only right for existing shareholders who have been disadvantaged by these actions from Ireland to have their position protected in the event of a successful outcome under the ECT Claim, notwithstanding the Suspension of trading in the Company's shares on AIM.\n'In the meantime, Shareholders will also continue to benefit from the Company's interest in the potential outcome of the ECT Claim and we believe this, along with our AIM listing, will provide significant value for discussions with interested parties looking to undertake a Reverse Takeover.\n'With a market capitalisation of less than \u00a31 million and a likely claim under the ECT in excess of US$100 million, we believe the Company's interest in the outcome of the ECT Claim potentially offers shareholders a multiple increase in the current valuation in any discussions over future assets vended into the Company and constituting a Reverse Takeover which, in turn, would also see a lifting in the suspension of our shares on AIM.'\nFor further information please contact:\nLansdowne Oil & Gas plc\n+353 1 963 1760\nSteve Boldy\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nStuart Gledhill\nRichard Hail\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3192 1739\nJoint Broker\nOliver Stansfield\nNotes to editors:\nAbout Lansdowne\nLansdowne Oil & Gas (LOGP.LN) is an oil and gas exploration and appraisal company focused on the North Celtic Sea and quoted on the AIM market and head quartered in Dublin.\nIn May 2023 the application for a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe Field, in which Lansdowne held a 20% interest, was refused by the Irish Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.\nIn June 2023 Lansdowne announced the commencement of action under the Arbitration Process of the Energy Charter Treaty.\nSince 20 September 2023, Lansdowne has been designated a \"Cash-Shell\" under AIM Rule 15.\nFor more information on Lansdowne, please refer to\nwww.lansdowneoilandgas.com\n.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In 2022, 82% of Ireland's energy needs came from imports. 48% of energy used in 2022 was from imported oil and nearly 31% from natural gas. 74% of Ireland's natural gas came from imports through two interconnectors from the UK.\n\u00b7\nA disruption of gas supplies from the UK, for whatever reason, would have a significant impact on Ireland's economic and social wellbeing.\nDemand side risks:\n\u00b7\nThe dependence of the electricity system on natural gas is expected to increase in the short to medium-term, particularly at times of very low wind. In addition, the peak day demand for natural gas is expected to increase. This means the electricity system will continue to rely on natural gas as a fuel source as it transitions to a majority-renewables system and phases out natural gas in the medium term.\nIntroduction of a Strategic Gas Emergency Reserve:\n\u00b7\nIt is anticipated that a floating reserve (FSRU) will best meet the criteria set by the Government.\n\u00b7\nThe costs of this state-owned enterprise will be paid for by an additional levy on the consumer, as applies for NORA (National Oil Reserves Agency)\nThe Oil Sector\n\u00b7\nIreland relies heavily on imports to meet its oil requirements as it does not produce crude oil and is a net importer of refined products.\nGiven all of the above, it is extraordinary that Eamon Ryan Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport blocked the progress of the Barryroe oil and gas field, that contains abundant supplies of both fuels, especially given the application was also noted as being satisfactory from a technical standpoint.\nThe development of Barryroe would ensure secure indigenous supplies of both oil and gas, with lower emissions/carbon footprint, compared with imports. A study commissioned by Europa Oil and Gas (Holdings) plc and announced on 7th March 2023, found that the Emission Intensity (EI) from the indigenous Corrib Field at 5 kgCO2e/boe is 14% of the EI of imported gas from the UK and 3.5% of the EI of LNG imported from the US.\nOffshore Wind\nMinister Ryan is placing all his faith in developing offshore wind at scale and at pace. As recognised in the McCarthy Report on the Security of Electricity Supply, \"The ambition to decarbonise has not been matched by sufficient management of the project delivery risks, with evidence of an underestimation of risk in the sector.\"\nA recent article on Offshore Wind in the Guardian newspaper (27 October 2023) commented on the headwinds facing the industry. Siemens Energy had encountered problems with the turbines it manufactures and was in rescue talks with the German Government to secure ?15 billion to shore up its balance sheet.\nVatenfall AB had stopped work on a windfarm project off the coast of Norfolk as the recent 40% rise in costs meant it was no longer profitable.\nThe Danish windfarm giant \u00d8rsted A/S announced a near \u00a32 billion asset write-down due to delays in windfarm projects offshore the U.S.\nOn 4th January 2024 Equinor ASA and BP Plc announced the termination of the Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate (OREC) Agreement for the Empire 2 project offshore the U.S.A. recognising that \"\ncommercial conditions driven by inflation, interest rates and supply chain disruptions that prevented Empire Wind 2's existing OREC agreement from being viable.\"\nConclusion:\nIt is the Company's view that the long delayed report on Ireland's Energy Security has taken a blinkered approach, driven entirely by environmental dogma, and will ensure that Ireland's energy insecurity will persist to 2030 and beyond and that the Irish consumer, already paying some of the highest electricity prices in Europe, will face additional cost burden. Energy insecurity of this nature will be magnified many times over in the event that global disruptions occur thus also multiplying the costs to the Irish consumer. Domestic energy supply can help to alleviate this multiplier effect.\nThere is an obvious alternative pathway, to allow the development of already discovered oil and gas resources in the Barryroe field, delivering greater security at lower cost and with lower associated emissions. There is no reliable forecast which shows an elimination of oil and gas imports to Ireland. Domestic oil and gas can provide energy security and be provided at a much lower emissions cost than imported oil and gas.\nThe Company remains willing to engage in any worthwhile or pragmatic discussion with the Irish Government, however all attempts to engage in such conversations at an appropriate level have been ignored by the Irish government. Without an ability to engage in a respectful and frank conversation the Company has no alternative other than to pursue its arbitration efforts under the Energy Charter Treaty.\nFor further information please contact:\nLansdowne Oil & Gas plc\n+353 1 963 1760\nSteve Boldy\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nStuart Gledhill\nRichard Hail\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 3192 1739\nJoint Broker\nOliver Stansfield\nNotes to editors:\nAbout Lansdowne\nLansdowne Oil & Gas (LOGP.LN) is an oil and gas exploration and appraisal company focused on the North Celtic Sea and quoted on the AIM market and head quartered in Dublin.\nIn May 2023 the application for a Lease Undertaking for the Barryroe Field, in which Lansdowne held a 20% interest, was refused by the Irish Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.\nIn June 2023 Lansdowne announced the commencement of action under the Arbitration Process of the Energy Charter Treaty.\nSince 20 September 2023, Lansdowne has been designated a \"Cash-Shell\" under AIM Rule 15.\nFor more information on Lansdowne, please refer to\nwww.lansdowneoilandgas.com\n.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
