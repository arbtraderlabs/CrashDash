On June 29, 2025 the Company received the settlement amount.\nCommenting on the results, executive director Ron Hadassi said:\n\"The Company continues to take all necessary steps regarding the Casa Radio Project. It has submitted a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") against Romania, seeking compensation for losses arising from the Romanian authorities' failure to cooperate, negotiate, and amend the PPP agreement.

(\nwww.plazacenters.com\n) is listed on the Main Board of the London Stock Exchange, as of 19 October 2007, on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (LSE: \"PLAZ\", WSE: \"PLZ/PLAZACNTR\") and, on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements with respect to Plaza Centers N.V. future (financial) performance and position. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections of Plaza Centers N.V. and information currently available to the company. Plaza Centers N.V. cautions readers that such statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and therefore it should be understood that many factors can cause actual performance and position to differ materially from these statements.\nMANAGEMENT STATEMENT\nDuring first half of 2025 the Company also continued cost reductions in administrative expenses and costs of operations.\nIn connection with Casa Radio Project, as stated above, the Company issued a Notice of Dispute and Acceptance of Offer and Consent to Arbitrate to Romania with respect to the Project and we hope this will help us to unblock the current status of the Project.\nIn addition, on December 5, 2024 the Company and AFI Europe N.V. (\"AFI Europe\") agreed to extend the Long Stop Date, which is the date on which the parties will execute a share purchase agreement, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent (the \"SPA\"), until December 31, 2025.\nDue to the board and management estimation that the Company is unable to serve its entire debt according to the current redemption date (January 1, 2026) in its current liquidity position, the Company intends to request from the bondholders of both series (Series A and Series B) postponement of the repayment of the remaining balance of the bonds.\nResults\nDuring the first half of the year, Plaza recorded a \u20ac3.5 million loss attributable to the shareholders of the Company (30 June 2024: \u20ac8.9 million). Total result of operations excluding finance income and finance cost was a loss of \u20ac0 in 2025 compared to reported loss of \u20ac0.9 million in the first half of 2024. The results were mainly due to administrative expenses and arbitration costs\nand additional income of \u20ac0.4 million which offset the expenses.\nLiquidity & Financing\nPlaza ended the period with a consolidated c\nash position of circa \u20ac2.2 million, compared to \u20ac2.6 million at the end of 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Group's outstanding obligation to bondholders (including accrued interests) are app. \u20ac162.7 million.\nAs disclosed in Note 6(d) below the Company was not able to meet its final redemption obligation to its (Series A and Series B) bondholders, due on July 1, 2025, and the bondholders approved to postpone the final redemption date to January 1, 2026.\nDue to the board and management estimation that the Company is unable to serve its entire debt according to the current bond's repayment schedule in its current liquidity position, the Company intends to request the bondholders of both series to postpone the repayment of the remaining balance of the bonds. However, there is an uncertainty if the bondholders will approve the request. In the case that the bondholders would declare their remaining claims to become immediately due and payable, the Company would not be in a position to settle those claims and would need to enter into an additional debt restructuring or might cease to be a going concern.\nStrategy and Outlook\nThe Company's priorities are focused on efforts to sign definitive sale agreement of Casa Radio project. The Company also intends to seek for bondholders' approval for postponement of the repayment of the bonds. In addition, the Company intends to continue the cost-cutting of its operational cost.\nOPERATIONAL REVIEW\nThe Company's current assets are summarised in the table below (as of balance sheet date):\nAsset/ Project\nLocation\nNature of asset\nSize\nsqm (GLA)\nPlaza's effective ownership\n%\nStatus\nCasa Radio\nBucharest, Romania\nMixed-use retail, hotel and leisure plus office scheme\n467,000 (GBA including parking spaces)\n75\nPre-sale agreement signed\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nResults\nIn the first half of 2025, administrative expenses amounted to \u20ac0.3 million, compared to the first half of 2024, primarily reflecting lower legal expenses. In both periods, administrative expenses include legal costs related to the arbitration proceedings initiated by the Company in Romania in connection with the Casa Radio Project, as described above.\nNet finance result changed from \u20ac8 million loss in the first 6 months of 2024 to \u20ac3.5 million loss in the first 6 months of 2025. The main components of net finance incomes were foreign currency gain on bonds (including inflation) and interests' expenses accrued on the debentures which includes also penalty interest calculated on the deferred principal.\nAs a result, the loss for the period amounted to circa \u20ac3.5 million in the first 6 months of 2025, representing a basic and diluted loss per share for the period of \u20ac0.51 (H1 2024: \u20ac1.30 loss).\nBalance sheet and cash flow\nThe balance sheet as of 30 June 2025 showed total assets of \u20ac2.3 million compared to total assets of \u20ac2.6 million at the end of 2024\n, mainly as a result of\nadministrative expenses and costs of operations\n.\nThe consolidated cash position (cash on standalone basis as well as fully owned subsidiaries) as of 30 June 2025 decreased to \u20ac2.2 million (31 December 2024: \u20ac2.6 million).\nAs of 30 June 2025, the Company has a balance sheet liability of \u20ac102 million from issuing bonds on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Additionally, the Company recorded provision for interests on bonds as of June 30, 2025, in an amount of \u20ac60.7 million (31 December 2024: \u20ac55.1 million).\nDisclosure in accordance with Regulation 10(B)14 of the Israeli Securities Regulations (periodic and immediate reports), 5730-1970\n1.\nGeneral Background\nAccording to the abovementioned regulation, upon existence of warning signs as defined in the regulation, the Company is obliged to attach its report's projected cash flow for a period of two years, commencing with the date of approval of the reports (\"Projected Cash Flow\").\nThe material uncertainty related to going concern was included in Note 1(b).\nIn light of the material uncertainty that the SPA between the Company and AFI Europe N.V. will eventually be executed and/or that the transaction will be consummated as presented above or at all (refer to Note 5), the board and management estimates that the Company is unable to serve its entire debt according to the due date the bondholders approved to postpone the final redemption date. Accordingly, it is expected that the Company will not be able to meet its entire contractual obligations in the following 12 months.\nWith such warning signs, the Company is providing projected cash flow for the period of 24 months following for the coming two years.\n2.\nProjected cash flow\nThe Company has implemented the restructuring plan that was approved by the Dutch court on July 9, 2014 (the \"Restructuring Plan\"). Under the Restructuring Plan, principal payments under the bonds issued by the Company and originally due in the years 2013 to 2015 were deferred for a period of four and a half years, and principal payments originally due in 2016 and 2017 were deferred for a period of one year. During first three months of 2017, the Company paid to its bondholders a total amount of NIS 191.7 million (EUR 49.2 million) as an early redemption. Upon such payments, the Company complied with the Early Prepayment Term (early redemption at the total sum of at least NIS 382 million) and thus obtained a deferral of one year for the remaining contractual obligations of the bonds.\nIn January 2018, a settlement agreement was signed by and among the Company and the two Israeli Series of Bonds.\nOn November 22, 2018 the Company announced based on its current forecasts, that the Company expected to pay the accrued interest on Series A and Series B Bonds on December 31, 2018, in accordance with the repayment schedule determined in the Company's Restructuring Plan and Settlement Agreement with Series A and Series B Bondholders from 11 January 2018 (the \"Settlement Agreement\"). The Company noted that it will not meet its principal repayment due on December 31, 2018 as provided for in the Settlement Agreement. On February 18, 2019 the Company paid principal of circa EUR 250,000 and Penalty interest on arrears of EUR 150,000 following the bondholder's approval to defer principal repayment to July 1, 2019.\nIn addition, during June 2019 the bondholders approved the deferral of the full payment of principal due on July 1, 2019 and of 58% (\"deferred interest amount\") of the sum of interest (consisting of the total interest accrued for the outstanding balance of the principal, including interest for part of the principal payment which was deferred as of February 18, 2019, plus interest arrears for part of the principal which was fixed on February 18, 2019 and was not paid by the Company and all in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed; \"the full amount of interest\"), the effective date of which is June 19, 2019, and the payment date was fixed as of July 1, 2019. The company paid on the said date a total amount of circa EUR 1.17 million, which is only 42% of the full amount of interest.\nOn July 11, 2019, the Company announced that its Romanian subsidiary had signed a binding agreement to sell land in Romania (refer to Note 5(3)(f) of the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020), and that the Company would use part of the proceeds now received by it EUR 0.75 million (hereinafter: \"the amount payable\"), in order to make a partial interest payment to the bondholders (Series A) and (Series B) issued by the Company. The payment required changes in the repayment schedule and amendments of the trust deeds which was approved unanimously by the Bondholders. The amount payable was paid on August 14, 2019 and reflects 30% of accrued interest as of that date.\nOn November 17, 2019, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved a deferral of all the scheduled Principal payment and app. 87% of deferral of the scheduled Interest payment, both, as of December 31, 2019 to July 1, 2020.\nOn May 4, 2020, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved: (i) to postpone the final redemption date to January 1, 2021 of all the scheduled Principal; (ii) that on July 1, 2020 the Company will pay to its bondholders a partial interest payment in the total amount of EUR 250,000 and to deferral all other unpaid scheduled Interest payment.\nFollowing receiving the Settlement Amount related to the final price adjustment of the sale of Belgrade Plaza and in light of the potential negative impact of the Covid-19 on the possibility to receive future proceeds from the Company's plots in India, the Company decided to increase the amount to be paid to the bondholders on July 1, 2020, from EUR 250,000 to EUR 500,000. The amount reflected 6.74% of accrued interest as of that date.\nOn November 12, 2020, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved: (i) to postpone the final redemption date to July 1, 2021 of all the scheduled Principal; that on January 1, 2021 the Company will pay to its bondholders a partial interest payment in the total amount of EUR 200,000 and to deferral all other unpaid interest. The amount reflected 1.84% of accrued interest as of that date.\nOn April 12, 2021, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved: (i) to postpone the final redemption date to January 1, 2022; (ii) that on July 1, 2021 the Company will pay to its bondholders a partial interest payment in the total amount of EUR 125,000 and to deferral all other unpaid interest. The amount reflected 0.84% of accrued interest as of that date.\nOn November 25, 2021, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved: (i) to postpone the final redemption date to July 1, 2022; (ii) that on January 1, 2022 the Company will pay to its bondholders a partial interest payment in the total amount of EUR 125,000 and to deferral all other unpaid interest. The amount reflected 0.92% of accrued interest as of that date.\nOn June 16, 2022, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved to postpone the final redemption date to January 1, 2023.\nOn November 8, 2022, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved: (i) to postpone the final redemption date to July 1, 2023; (ii) that on January 1, 2023 the Company will pay to its bondholders a partial interest payment in the total amount of EUR 2,000,000 and to deferral all other unpaid interest. The amount reflected 6.08% of accrued interest as of that date.\nFurther, in 2023 the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved: (i) to postpone the final redemption date to January 1, 2024; (ii) that on July 1, 2023 the Company will pay to its bondholders a partial interest payment in the total amount of EUR 750,000 and to deferral all other unpaid interest. The amount reflected 6.08% of accrued interest as of that date.\nOn November 11, 2023, the bondholders of Series A and Series B approved: (i) to postpone the final redemption date to July 1, 2024; (ii) that on January 1, 2024 the Company will pay to its bondholders a partial interest payment in the total amount of EUR 200,000 and to defer all other unpaid interest.

Therefore, delays in the realisation of the Company's assets and investments or realisation at a lower price than expected by the Company, as well as any other deviation from the Company's assumptions (such as additional expenses due to suspension of trading, delay in submitting the statutory reports etc.), could have an adverse effect on the Company's cash flow and the Company's ability to service its indebtedness in a timely manner.\nIn \u20ac millions\n7-12/2025\n2026\nCash - Opening Balance (2)\n2.20\n1.7\nProceeds from other income (3)\n-\n-\nTotal Sources\n2.20\n1.7\nDebentures - principal\n-\n-\nDebentures - interest (4)\n-\n-\nOther operational costs (5)\n0.2\n0.5\nG&A expenses (including property maintenance) (6)\n0.3\n0.8\nTotal Uses\n0.5\n1.3\nCash - Closing Balance (2)\n1.7\n0.4\n1.

Plaza Centers N.V. (\"the Company\"\nand together with its subsidiaries, \"the Group\"\n) was incorporated and is registered in the Netherlands. The Company's registered office is at Tolstraat 112, 1074 VK\n, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In the past the Company\nconducted its activities in the field of establishing, operating and selling of shopping and entertainment centres, as well as other mixed-use projects (retail, office, residential) in Central and Eastern Europe (starting 1996) and India (from 2006). Following debt restructuring plan approved in 2014 the Group's main focus is to reduce corporate debt by early repayments following sale of assets and to continue with efficiency measures and cost reduction where possible.\nThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the \"Group\") and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities.\nThe Company is listed on the premium segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (\"LSE\"), the Warsaw Stock Exchange (\"WSE\") and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (\"TASE\").\nb.\nGoing concern and liquidity position of the Company\n:\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company's outstanding obligations to bondholders (including accrued interests) are app. EUR 162.7 million due date of which was postponed to January 1, 2026 (the \"\nCurrent Due date\n\") (please refer to Note 6(d)).\nDue to the above the Company's primary need is for liquidity. The Company's current and future resources include the following:\n1. Cash and cash equivalents (including the cash of fully owned subsidiaries) of approximately EUR 2.2 million.\n2. The Company and AFI Europe N.V. (\"AFI Europe\") entered into an addendum to the pre-sale agreement entered into between the Parties in connection with the sale of its subsidiary (the \"SPV\") which holds 75% in the Casa Radio Project (the \"Project\") (the \"Addendum\" and the \"Agreement\", respectively) pursuant to which the Parties agreed to extend the Long Stop Date, which is the date on which the parties will execute a share purchase agreement, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent (the \"SPA\"), until December 31, 2025. There can be no certainty that the SPA will eventually be executed and/or that the transaction will be consummated as presented above or at all.\n3. In addition, as detailed in note 5(2) of the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2024, the Company has submitted with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\") against Romania for compensation of losses incurred due to failure of the Romanian authorities to cooperate, negotiate and adjust the PPP agreement as described in the note 5(1)(c) of the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2024 which include the Company's investment in the Project SPV, loss of potential profit, and costs and expenses of the arbitration.\nAt this stage there is no certainty about the result of the dispute, hence no resources are expected to be available in the foreseeable future.\nNOTE 1: - CORPORATE INFORMATION (Cont.)\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company is not in compliance with the main Covenants as defined in the restructuring plan (for more details refer also to Note 8 of the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2024), hence under defaulted which could also trigger early repayment clause by the bondholders.\nDue to the abovementioned and due to the board and management estimation that the Company is unable to serve its entire debt on the Current Due Date, the Company intends to request the bondholders of both series an additional postponement of the repayment of the remaining balance of the bonds. However, there is an uncertainty if the bondholders will approve the request. In the case that the bondholders would declare their remaining claims to become immediately due and payable, the Company would not be in a position to settle those claims and would need to enter to an additional debt restructuring or might cease to be a going concern basis.\nDue to the abovementioned conditions a material uncertainty exists that casts significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able to meet the mandatory repayment obligations of its bonds and other working capital requirements.\nNOTE 2: - BASIS OF PREPARATIO\nN\na. Basis of preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial data:\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial data for the six months period ended June 30, 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 34 (\"Interim Financial Reporting\")\nas adopted by the European Union\n.\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2024.

Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nIn preparing this interim condensed consolidated financial information, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were principally the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2024, save for the changes highlighted above. Refer also to Note 1(b) above for significant estimations performed.\nNOTE\n4\n: - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCarrying amounts and fair values\nIn respect to the Company's financial instruments assets not presented at fair value, being mostly short-term market interest bearing liquid balances, the Company believes that the carrying amount approximates its fair value.

In light of the above the Company is exploring all its options in order to obtain progress, including among others its legal options. For details regarding the issuance of a notice of dispute and acceptance of offer and consent to arbitrate to Romania with respect to the \"Casa Radio\" project refer to Note 5(2) to the annual consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024. Accordingly,\nthe Tribunal's decision is expected in the end of 2025.\nDue to the above, there can be no certainty that the SPA will eventually be executed and/or that the transaction will be completed.\nc. Write-down of trading properties:\nAs detailed in\nthe annual consolidated financial statements, the value of the trading property of the Project was fully reduced (for more details refer to Note 5(2) to the annual consolidated financial statements\nas\nof December 31, 2024).\nStill, the Company believes that despite this reduction there is no change in the value of the Company's rights under the PPP Agreement.
