Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k.

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

EBITDA  - Up PBT  -  No brackets!. Cash flow - significantly up. Debt - Under control.  Debt to EBITDA ratio is c1.3x So, why does a company making \u00a318m EBITDA, and converting 90%+ of this into cash have a valuation of just \u00a352m? In my view more conventional metrics would push this north of \u00a3100m. Much of the difference between EBITDA and PBT is going on amortisation of previous acquisitions (Non-cash item), and depreciation which will unwind, albeit they have the costs of setting up Vietnam factory to digest still.  Interest charges are up, but indicators are that rates have peaked. So, the valuation should be rebalanced provided that they continue to chew through the DA, and deliver on the cash conversion, so that they can re-instate the dividend, which should bring back the demand for the stock. Real opportunity to see this double in price, and that's before any growth is factored in. One danger whilst the price is so low, is that somewhere a PE house snaps this up and takes it private at a bargain price. All IMO. - please always DYOR!.",

Yet the Market gives the company a valuation of just \u00a345m.  - Approximately 2.5x EBITDA!. Is it really down to the fact that the company has had a couple of years of flat financial performance?. If the Vietnam factory is now producing then that is one cash hungry variable which will hopefully be an engine to drive growth.  Presumably the capex for the factory is \"one-off\", which means that there will be \u00a3low millions available for the resumption of the dividend. \u00a32m back to dividends will pay 2p per share, which at todays price would be 5%!. Maybe that will bring back the investor following. FG",

HTtps://www.scsw.co.uk/issues/february-2025/inspecs/ Meta deal.......EssilorLuxottica and penned a 10-year deal with its Ray-Ban brand, which having bought Nuance Audio can incorporate hearing aids into the frame (pending FDA clearance). These look just like any other pair of spectacles but a device inside the arm of the glasses can isolate speech sounds in front of the wearer. In the UK, Essilor\u2019s \u00a340m-cap rival, Inspecs (SPEC; 41.75p), has been busy. Its Norville lens division has been working on smart glasses designed to assist workers in Amazon warehouses and even surgeons in operating rooms. Until now CEO Richard Peck has been preaching patience but the expectation is that current consultancy agreements will convert into firm orders. Established in 1988, Inspecs started its journey as a supplier of corrective eyewear frames to retailers, like Specsavers. For years, it sourced acetate frames from China but evolved, shifting from low-margin, own-label products to high-margin branded frames. By licensing popular brands, such as Caterpillar, Barbour and O\u2019Neill, Inspecs found a way to add more value to its product offerings. But the real game-changer came with the acquisition of Eschenbach, a German wholesaler that gave Inspecs access to 80% of independent opticians in Germany and 40% in the US. Eschenbach added Titanflex (No.1 brand in Germany) as well as the new Optaro smartphone lens attachment/App to enlarge text by up to 15x, offering assistance for users with visual impairments. The company has turned to vertical integration, which will push gross margin and ebitda margin up from the present 51.4% and 8.7%. In\u2008FY24, the frame factory in Vietnam was completed (nameplate of 12m frames) and it has begun to shift production in-house, initially acetate frame manufacturing from third-party suppliers in China. Not only do factory workers earn 60% less than Chinese counterparts but Vietnam also isn't impacted by Trump\u2019s tariffs, a point not lost on US buyers. With 45,000 optical stores in the US versus 5,000 in the UK and 6,500 in Germany, Peck says FY25 has started well. Peel Hunt forecasts EPS of 6p rising to 7.3p next year, dropping the PE to 5.7",

At 55.5p the market cap\u2019s around \u00a357m, with net debt of ~\u00a325m, so EV about \u00a382m. For a global eyewear group turning over ~\u00a3200m, that\u2019s 0.4x sales \u2013 cheap. Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

          "content": "I agree with your sentiment IP, about Opportunist investors swooping when the heavy lifting has been completed, and as others have said subsequent to your post, it is going to be down to whether or not the Board hold out for a realistic valuation as to whether or not this ends happily for us.. In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k.

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

Preparing the investors for a poor performance even when it comes to disposing of the company. \u00a317.7m EBITDA, times  a multiple of 6, which is what a PE house would bid to give them some upside, values the company at \u00a3102m. Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k. Best of luck to those of you who remain, but on this occasion ....a bird in the hand and all that.! FG",

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

EBITDA  - Up PBT  -  No brackets!. Cash flow - significantly up. Debt - Under control.  Debt to EBITDA ratio is c1.3x So, why does a company making \u00a318m EBITDA, and converting 90%+ of this into cash have a valuation of just \u00a352m? In my view more conventional metrics would push this north of \u00a3100m. Much of the difference between EBITDA and PBT is going on amortisation of previous acquisitions (Non-cash item), and depreciation which will unwind, albeit they have the costs of setting up Vietnam factory to digest still.  Interest charges are up, but indicators are that rates have peaked. So, the valuation should be rebalanced provided that they continue to chew through the DA, and deliver on the cash conversion, so that they can re-instate the dividend, which should bring back the demand for the stock. Real opportunity to see this double in price, and that's before any growth is factored in. One danger whilst the price is so low, is that somewhere a PE house snaps this up and takes it private at a bargain price. All IMO. - please always DYOR!.",

Yet the Market gives the company a valuation of just \u00a345m.  - Approximately 2.5x EBITDA!. Is it really down to the fact that the company has had a couple of years of flat financial performance?. If the Vietnam factory is now producing then that is one cash hungry variable which will hopefully be an engine to drive growth.  Presumably the capex for the factory is \"one-off\", which means that there will be \u00a3low millions available for the resumption of the dividend. \u00a32m back to dividends will pay 2p per share, which at todays price would be 5%!.

HTtps://www.scsw.co.uk/issues/february-2025/inspecs/ Meta deal.......EssilorLuxottica and penned a 10-year deal with its Ray-Ban brand, which having bought Nuance Audio can incorporate hearing aids into the frame (pending FDA clearance). These look just like any other pair of spectacles but a device inside the arm of the glasses can isolate speech sounds in front of the wearer. In the UK, Essilor\u2019s \u00a340m-cap rival, Inspecs (SPEC; 41.75p), has been busy. Its Norville lens division has been working on smart glasses designed to assist workers in Amazon warehouses and even surgeons in operating rooms. Until now CEO Richard Peck has been preaching patience but the expectation is that current consultancy agreements will convert into firm orders. Established in 1988, Inspecs started its journey as a supplier of corrective eyewear frames to retailers, like Specsavers. For years, it sourced acetate frames from China but evolved, shifting from low-margin, own-label products to high-margin branded frames. By licensing popular brands, such as Caterpillar, Barbour and O\u2019Neill, Inspecs found a way to add more value to its product offerings. But the real game-changer came with the acquisition of Eschenbach, a German wholesaler that gave Inspecs access to 80% of independent opticians in Germany and 40% in the US. Eschenbach added Titanflex (No.1 brand in Germany) as well as the new Optaro smartphone lens attachment/App to enlarge text by up to 15x, offering assistance for users with visual impairments. The company has turned to vertical integration, which will push gross margin and ebitda margin up from the present 51.4% and 8.7%. In\u2008FY24, the frame factory in Vietnam was completed (nameplate of 12m frames) and it has begun to shift production in-house, initially acetate frame manufacturing from third-party suppliers in China. Not only do factory workers earn 60% less than Chinese counterparts but Vietnam also isn't impacted by Trump\u2019s tariffs, a point not lost on US buyers. With 45,000 optical stores in the US versus 5,000 in the UK and 6,500 in Germany, Peck says FY25 has started well. Peel Hunt forecasts EPS of 6p rising to 7.3p next year, dropping the PE to 5.7",

Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k.

In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

At 55.5p the market cap\u2019s around \u00a357m, with net debt of ~\u00a325m, so EV about \u00a382m. For a global eyewear group turning over ~\u00a3200m, that\u2019s 0.4x sales \u2013 cheap. Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k.

In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

At 55.5p the market cap\u2019s around \u00a357m, with net debt of ~\u00a325m, so EV about \u00a382m. For a global eyewear group turning over ~\u00a3200m, that\u2019s 0.4x sales \u2013 cheap. Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

At 55.5p the market cap\u2019s around \u00a357m, with net debt of ~\u00a325m, so EV about \u00a382m. For a global eyewear group turning over ~\u00a3200m, that\u2019s 0.4x sales \u2013 cheap. Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k.

          "content": "I agree with your sentiment IP, about Opportunist investors swooping when the heavy lifting has been completed, and as others have said subsequent to your post, it is going to be down to whether or not the Board hold out for a realistic valuation as to whether or not this ends happily for us.. In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

At 55.5p the market cap\u2019s around \u00a357m, with net debt of ~\u00a325m, so EV about \u00a382m. For a global eyewear group turning over ~\u00a3200m, that\u2019s 0.4x sales \u2013 cheap. Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k.

          "content": "I agree with your sentiment IP, about Opportunist investors swooping when the heavy lifting has been completed, and as others have said subsequent to your post, it is going to be down to whether or not the Board hold out for a realistic valuation as to whether or not this ends happily for us.. In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

At 55.5p the market cap\u2019s around \u00a357m, with net debt of ~\u00a325m, so EV about \u00a382m. For a global eyewear group turning over ~\u00a3200m, that\u2019s 0.4x sales \u2013 cheap. Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share.

          "content": "I agree with your sentiment IP, about Opportunist investors swooping when the heavy lifting has been completed, and as others have said subsequent to your post, it is going to be down to whether or not the Board hold out for a realistic valuation as to whether or not this ends happily for us.. In that respect, having competitive bidders is definitely a good thing and will help our cause. I too have been here 3+ years, - my highest price paid of \u00a31.24 for a tranche in summer 2023, but having been able to trade some of the volatility on its way down, I now have an all-time average  of just under 55p, on a holding of c50,000 shares, and so from that point of view returning back to the black, is welcomed by me. However, if i were to be critical, in the 3 years that I have been invested, the board have continually posted trading results which have disappointed - there has always been one reason or another as to why the numbers have missed, and we have to wait another period. ...and it is this inability to manage city expectations which, in my view accounts for a lot of the downward drift in price from the \u00a31.25 highs of summer '23 to the 40s in recent weeks. After the Trump Tariffs episode,  I had got to the point where I was thinking my money could work harder for me elsewhere, and so on balance, I hope that one of these bids succeeds, but at a fair valuation. .... having said that, I too think that on balance, with the VIetnam factory now up and running, and with the business trading profitably and generating cash, as it it, then, if it is sold, I am confident that it will go for a price north of \u00a31. Adjusted EBITDA for the  current year is going to be c\u00a315m - \u00a316m, and with cash generation of c80 - 100% of this figure. So, a profitable business, - albeit troubled by the uncertainty of tariffs. - that has seemingly run out of steam / starting to go backwards. So a 5 - 6x multiple of this would be bordering on a firesale.  5 x 15m is \u00a375m. 6 x \u00a316m is \u00a396m.  Add a bit of premium for competitive bidding, and I can see \u00a3101m being paid, which equates to \u00a31 per share. The story is good. The scale is fully formed, and distribution looks fit for purpose....it has just been an underwhelming ride for the past 3 years, and therefore it is probably in the best interests of the business for another team to have a go.

At 55.5p the market cap\u2019s around \u00a357m, with net debt of ~\u00a325m, so EV about \u00a382m. For a global eyewear group turning over ~\u00a3200m, that\u2019s 0.4x sales \u2013 cheap. Most trade buyers or PE funds pay 0.6\u20130.8x sales for consumer brands with margin recovery potential. Even 0.6x gets you close to \u00a3120m EV, which after debt equates to roughly 75p a share. Inspecs also owns strong labels \u2013 Superdry, Barbour, Radley, Ted Baker, etc \u2013 plus vertical manufacturing in Vietnam. Streamlined costs and new management mean EBITDA normalising next year, so 6\u20137x forward multiple is realistic. Two credible bidders already in play and a third sniffing around assets. If either party wants exclusivity, they\u2019ll have to go north of 70p. My view: anything under that and the board will hold out. 75p looks fair value \u2013 80p possible if a strategic comes in.",

          "content": "The analysis of Inspecs Group plc (SPEC.L), a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of eyewear operating a vertically integrated platform , indicates that the company is currently priced below its intrinsic value, reflecting acute market concerns regarding revenue contraction and near-term liquidity management. The current market capitalization stands near \u00a374.2 million, translating to an Enterprise Value (EV) of approximately \u00a3110.2 million. Based on the midpoint of the company's FY2025 guidance, this implies a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 6.23x, representing a significant discount to the company\u2019s most relevant publicly traded peer, Safilo Group (median EV/EBITDA of 8.3x). The current valuation discount is rationalized by persistent net losses, two consecutive years of revenue decline, and the material disclosure of a debt covenant breach earlier in 2025. However, management\u2019s successful execution of synergy extraction and cost control, evidenced by the projected margin expansion, provides a clear pathway for valuation re-rating. Investment Conclusion Inspecs demonstrates operational resilience by improving margin quality despite macroeconomic challenges. The target intrinsic value range anticipates the market re-rating the stock as operational stability and Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation are proven. * Intrinsic Share Price Value Range: 95 pence \u2013 125 pence per share. * Mid-Point Target: 108 pence. This mid-point target represents substantial potential upside from the current price (approximately 72 pence). The realization of this value is strictly conditional upon the mitigation of material balance sheet risks and sustained delivery of the stated profitability targets. Recommendation HOLD/NEUTRAL. A BUY recommendation is inappropriate given the acute liquidity sensitivities demonstrated by the recent cash flow cover covenant breach , which increases investment risk significantly. A SELL recommendation is unwarranted given the deep discount to peers and the promising margin expansion indicated in the latest trading update. The position is maintained as neutral until firm evidence of sustained FCF generation and reduced working capital burden is provided in forthcoming results.",

Take off the debt which at year end I expect to be at circa \u00a324m, gives an enterprise value of  \u00a378m, or 76p per share. If I were a buyer, I would interpret todays RNS as a reason to chi the price, and so for that reason, having been here for 3 years, I have taken the benefit of the recent rise, and got out at an overall profit of c \u00a35k.
