The Acquisition is intended to be\nimplemented by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the\nCompanies Act although Bidco reserves the right to elect to implement the Acquisition by way of\na Takeover Offer (subject to the consent of the Panel). The scheme document in relation to the\nAcquisition was published on 15 January 2026 (\nScheme Document\n).\nBidco announces that it has today purchased a total of 19,458,611 Inspecs Shares at a price of 75\npence per Inspecs Share, representing approximately 19.1 per cent. of Inspecs' existing issued\nshare capital.\nThe Inspecs Shares so purchased includes 3,381,133 Inspecs Shares purchased from Downing\nin its capacity as manager of certain funds (\"\nDowning\n\") which were previously subject to the\nirrevocable undertaking detailed in paragraph 5 of Part X (Additional Information) of the Scheme\nDocument. The terms of this irrevocable undertaking are unchanged and continue to apply to the\nremaining 5,207,636 Inspecs Shares, representing 5.1 per cent. of Inspecs' existing issued share capital.\nIn addition, as set out in the Scheme Document, Bidco has also received irrevocable undertakings\nfrom other Inspecs Shareholders interested in a further 27,227,137 Inspecs Shares (including an irrevocable from Luke Johnson with respect of his holding of 5,959,270 Inspecs Shares).\nAccordingly, in addition to the Inspecs shares purchased today, Bidco has received irrevocable undertakings with respect to the Acquisition over Inspecs Shares representing 31.9 per cent of Inspecs' existing issued share capital (in addition to the Inspecs Shares acquired today).\nUnless otherwise defined in this announcement, capitalised words and phrases used in this announcement shall have the same meanings given to them in the Scheme Document.\nEnquiries\nBidco\nc/o Cavendish\nCavendish\n(Financial Adviser to Bidco Group and the Consortium)\nHenrik Persson\nMatt Goode\nFergus Sullivan\nFinn Gordon\n020 7220 0500\nDisclaimers\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (\nCavendish\n), which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, is acting as financial adviser exclusively for the Bidco Group and no one else in connection with the matters set out in this announcement and will not regard any other person as their client in relation to such matters and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Bidco Group for providing the protections afforded to clients of Cavendish nor for providing advice in relation to the contents of, or any matter referred to in, this announcement or any transaction or arrangement referred to herein.

The Acquisition will be implemented solely pursuant to the terms of the Scheme Document (or, if the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, the Offer Document), which will contain the full terms and conditions of the Acquisition, including details of how to vote in respect of the Acquisition. Any vote in respect of the Scheme (or the Takeover Offer, if applicable) or other response in relation to the Acquisition should be made only on the basis of the information contained in the Scheme Document (or, if the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, the Offer Document).\nThis announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the Takeover Code and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws or jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom.\nThis announcement is an advertisement and does not constitute a prospectus, prospectus equivalent document or exempted document.\nThe statements contained in this announcement are made as at the date of this announcement, unless some other time is specified in relation to them, and publication of this announcement shall not give rise to any implication that there has been no change in the facts set forth in this announcement since such date.\nThis announcement contains inside information in relation to Inspecs for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation.\nOverseas Shareholders\nThe release, publication or distribution of this announcement in or into jurisdictions other than the UK may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the law of any jurisdiction other than the UK should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. This announcement has been prepared in accordance with and for the purpose of complying with English law, the Takeover Code, the AIM Rules, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and Wales.\nThe availability of the Acquisition to Inspecs Shareholders who are not resident in and citizens of the UK may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located or of which they are citizens. Persons who are not resident in the UK should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements of their jurisdictions. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom to vote their Inspecs Shares with respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to appoint another person as proxy to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. Further details in relation to Overseas Shareholders will be contained in the Scheme Document.\nUnless otherwise determined by Bidco\nor required by the Takeover Code, and permitted by applicable law and regulation, the Acquisition will not be made available, directly or indirectly, in, into, from, or by the use of mails or any means or instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction and no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by any such use, means, instrumentality, or from within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Copies of this announcement and any formal documentation relating to the Acquisition are not being, and may not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including, without limitation, agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) may not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send the same in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. Doing so may render invalid any related purported vote in respect of the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), the Takeover Offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in, into, from, or by the use of mails or any means or instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Takeover Offer may not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities.\nThe availability of the Alternative Offer pursuant to the Acquisition to Inspecs Shareholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the ability of those persons to hold such shares may be affected by the laws or regulatory requirements of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are resident. Persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Inspecs Shareholders who are in any doubt about such matters should consult an appropriate independent professional adviser in the relevant jurisdiction without delay.\nFurther details in relation to Overseas Shareholders will be contained in the Scheme Document.\nNotice to US investors\nThe Acquisition relates to the securities of a company organised under the laws of England and Wales and is proposed to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act. This announcement, the Scheme Document and certain other documents relating to the Acquisition have been or will be prepared in accordance with English law, the AIM Rules, the Takeover Code and UK disclosure requirements, and the format and style applicable to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act, all of which differ from those in the United States. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules of Section 14(e) or the proxy solicitation rules of Section 14(a) under the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Scheme is subject to the disclosure requirements of and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes of arrangement, which differ from the disclosure requirements and practices of the United States tender offer and proxy solicitation rules.\nInspecs' financial statements, and all financial information that is included in this announcement or that may be included in the Scheme Document, or any other documents relating to the Acquisition, have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom and thus may not be comparable to financial statements of companies in the United States or other companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. US generally accepted principles differ in certain respects from the UK adopted International Accounting Standards. None of the financial information in this announcement has been audited in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the US or the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the US.\nThe Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and may not be offered, sold, exercised, resold, transferred or delivered, directly or indirectly, in or into the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. The Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes\nare expected to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act provided by section 3(a)(10) thereof. Section 3(a)(10) exempts securities issued in specified exchange transactions from the registration requirement under the US Securities Act where, among other things, the fairness of the terms and conditions of the issuance and exchange of such securities have been approved by a court or governmental authority expressly authorised by law to grant such approval, after a hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions of the exchange at which all persons to whom the Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes are proposed to be issued have the right to appear and receive adequate and timely notice thereof. If the exemption afforded by section 3(a)(10) is not available to Bidco, then Bidco expects to avail itself of another available exemption to the registration requirements under the US Securities Act. If Bidco exercises its right to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer, the Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes\nwill not be offered in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to registration under the US Securities Act.\nNeither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the Alternative Offer or determined if the Scheme Document is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence.\nIn accordance with normal UK practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the US Exchange Act (to the extent applicable), Bidco, its nominees or its brokers (acting as agents) may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Inspecs Shares outside of the US, other than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the Acquisition becomes Effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made, they would be made outside of the US and would be in accordance with applicable law, including the US Exchange Act and the Takeover Code. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com.\nIt may be difficult for US holders of Inspecs Shares to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under US federal securities laws in connection with the Acquisition, since Inspecs is organised under the laws of a country other than the United States, and some or all of its officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States, and most of the assets of Inspecs are located outside of the United States. US holders of Inspecs Shares may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of US federal securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's jurisdiction or judgment.\nIf Bidco were to elect to implement the Acquisition by means of a Takeover Offer, such Takeover Offer may be made in compliance with applicable US securities laws and regulations including, to the extent applicable, Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act and Regulation 14E thereunder, and will be made in accordance with the Takeover Code. Such a Takeover Offer may be made in the United States by Bidco and no one else. Accordingly, the Acquisition may be subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those applicable under US domestic tender offer procedures and law.\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the Acquisition by an Inspecs Shareholder in the United States as consideration for the transfer of its Inspecs Shares pursuant to the Scheme will likely be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under any applicable United States state and local income tax laws. Each Inspecs Shareholder in the United States is urged to consult its independent professional tax or legal adviser immediately regarding the US federal, state and local income and non-income tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to it, as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis announcement (including information incorporated by reference in this announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by Bidco and Inspecs contain statements which are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\". Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of Bidco and Inspecs about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on Bidco and Inspecs (including their future prospects, developments and strategies), the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"prepares\", \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"is subject to\", \"budget\", \"projects\", \"synergy\", \"strategy\", \"scheduled\", \"goal\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"cost-saving\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"should\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of Bidco's, any member of the Bidco Group's, Inspecs' or any member of the Inspecs Group's operations and potential synergies resulting from the Acquisition; and (iii) the effects of global economic conditions and governmental regulation on Bidco's, Inspecs' or any member of the Bidco Group's or Inspecs Group's business.\nAlthough Bidco and Inspecs believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, Bidco and Inspecs can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, and no undue reliance should be placed on any such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to: the ability to complete the Acquisition; the ability to obtain requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals and the satisfaction of other Conditions on the proposed terms and schedule; changes in the global political, economic, business and competitive environments and in market and regulatory forces; changes in future exchange and interest rates; changes in tax rates; future business combinations or disposals; changes in general economic and business conditions; changes in the behaviour of other market participants; changes in the anticipated benefits from the proposed transaction not being realised as a result of changes in general economic and market conditions in the countries in which Bidco, the Bidco Group, Inspecs and the Inspecs Group operate, weak, volatile or illiquid capital and/or credit markets, changes in tax rates, interest rate and currency value fluctuations, the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which Bidco and Inspecs operate and changes in laws or in supervisory expectations or requirements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected in the forward-looking statements. If any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialises or if any one or more of the assumptions proves incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither Bidco nor Inspecs, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only at the date of this announcement. All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to Bidco or any member of the Wider Bidco Group or the Wider Inspecs Group, or any of their respective associates, directors, officers, employees or advisers, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations, neither Bidco nor Inspecs is under any obligation, and Bidco and Inspecs expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nOther than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations, neither Bidco nor Inspecs is under any obligation, and Bidco and Inspecs expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nDealing and Opening Position Disclosure Requirements\nUnder Rule 8.3(a) of the Takeover Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.\nUnder Rule 8.3(b) of the Takeover Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing.\nIf two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.\nOpening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).\nDetails of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel's Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.\nPublication on a website\nIn accordance with Rule 26.1 of the Takeover Code, a copy of this announcement and the documents required to be published by Rule 26 of the Takeover Code will be made available, subject to certain restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on the website of Risk Capital Partners at\nwww.riskcapitalpartners.co.uk\nand on Inspecs' website at\nwww.inspecs.com\nby no later than 12 noon (London time) on the Business Day following this announcement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the content of these websites nor of any website accessible from hyperlinks set out in this announcement is incorporated by reference or forms part of this announcement.\nNo profit forecasts, estimates or quantified financial benefits statements\nNo statement in this announcement is intended as, or is to be construed as, a profit forecast, profit estimate or quantified financial benefits statement for any period and no statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for Inspecs for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share for Inspecs.\nRounding\nCertain figures included in this announcement have been subjected to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them.\nGeneral\nBidco reserves the right to elect to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer as an alternative to the Scheme (subject to the Panel's consent and the terms of the Cooperation Agreement). In such event, save as provided in the Takeover Code, the Acquisition will be implemented on substantially the same terms, so far as applicable, and subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, as those which will apply to the Scheme, subject to appropriate amendments to reflect, among other things, the change in method of effecting the Acquisition (including, without limitation: (i) the inclusion of an acceptance condition set at 90 per cent. of the Inspecs Shares to which such Takeover Offer relates (or such other percentage as Bidco may, subject to the rules of the Takeover Code and the terms of the Cooperation Agreement and with the consent of the Panel, decide); and (ii) those required by, or deemed appropriate by, Bidco under applicable law).\nIn the event that the Acquisition is to be implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, Inspecs Shares will be acquired pursuant to the\nTakeover Offer fully paid and free from all liens, charges, equitable interests, encumbrances and rights of pre-emption and any other interests of any nature whatsoever and together with all rights attaching thereto including the right to receive and retain all dividends and distributions declared, made or paid,\nor any other return of capital (whether by way of reduction of share capital, repurchase, redemption or otherwise) made, by reference to a record date after the Effective Date.\nIf the Acquisition is effected by way of a Takeover Offer and such Takeover Offer becomes or is declared unconditional and sufficient acceptances are received, Bidco intends to: (i) request that the London Stock Exchange cancels admission of the Inspecs Shares to trading on AIM; and (ii) exercise its rights (to the extent such rights are available) to apply the provisions of Chapter 3 of Part 28 of the Companies Act to acquire compulsorily the remaining Inspecs Shares in respect of which the\nTakeover Offer has not been accepted.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Capitalised terms used but not defined in this announcement have the meanings given to them in the Scheme Document, unless the context requires otherwise.\nThe Court Meeting and the General Meeting are due to be held on Monday 9 February 2026.\nInspecs announces that it has received proxy votes in relation to the resolution to be put at the Court Meeting and the resolution to be put at the General Meeting (together, the \"\nResolutions\n\") such that, if those proxy votes are not changed at or before the Court Meeting or the General Meeting (as applicable), the Resolutions will fail. If either of the Resolutions fails, the Scheme and the Acquisition will lapse.\nThe Inspecs Directors have agreed that the chair of the Meetings will use the discretion available to him to adjourn the Meetings. At the Meetings on 9 February 2026, the only business to be dealt with will be to adjourn the Meetings.\nAccordingly, the Inspecs Directors recommend that Inspecs\nShareholders do not attend the Meetings on 9 February 2026.\nThe Court Meeting will be adjourned to Monday 23 February 2026 at 10.00 a.m. and the General Meeting will be adjourned to Monday 23 February 2026 at 10.15 a.m. (or as soon thereafter as the Court Meeting concludes or is further adjourned), respectively, at the offices of Macfarlanes LLP, 20 Cursitor Street, London EC4A 1LT.\nIn respect of each Meeting, the relevant Forms of Proxy (or electronic appointment) should be received as soon as possible and in any event no later than the relevant time set out below:\n\u00b7\nBLUE Forms of Proxy for the Court Meeting 10.00 a.m. on Thursday 19 February 2026\n\u00b7\nWHITE Forms of Proxy for the General Meeting 10.15 a.m. on Thursday 19 February 2026\nor, in the case of a further adjourned Meeting, not later than 48 hours (excluding any part of the day that is not a Business Day) before the time fixed for such further adjourned meeting.\nIf the BLUE Form of Proxy for use at the Court Meeting is not lodged so as to be received by 10.00 a.m. on 19 February 2026, it may be handed to the chair of the Court Meeting or a representative of Equiniti on behalf of the chair.

Any vote in respect of the Scheme (or the Takeover Offer, if applicable) or other response in relation to the Acquisition should be made only on the basis of the information contained in the Scheme Document (or, if the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer, the Offer Document).\nThis Announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the Takeover Code and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this Announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws or jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom.\nThis Announcement is an advertisement and does not constitute a prospectus, prospectus equivalent document or exempted document.\nOverseas Shareholders\nThe release, publication or distribution of this Announcement in or into jurisdictions other than the UK may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the law of any jurisdiction other than the UK should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Any failure to comply with such requirements may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. This Announcement has been prepared in accordance with and for the purpose of complying with English law, the Takeover Code, the AIM Rules, the Market Abuse Regulation and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside England and Wales.\nThe availability of the Acquisition (including the Alternative Offer) to Inspecs Shareholders who are not resident in and citizens of the UK may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located or of which they are citizens. Persons who are not resident in the UK should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements of their jurisdictions. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom to vote their Inspecs Shares with respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to appoint another person as proxy to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person.\nUnless otherwise determined by Bidco\nor required by the Takeover Code, and permitted by applicable law and regulation, the Acquisition will not be made available, directly or indirectly, in, into, from, or by the use of mails or any means or instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction and no person may vote in favour of the Scheme by any such use, means, instrumentality, or from within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Copies of this Announcement and any formal documentation relating to the Acquisition are not being, and may not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including, without limitation, agents, custodians, nominees and trustees) may not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send the same in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. Doing so may render invalid any related purported vote in respect of the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is implemented by way of a Takeover Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law and regulation), the Takeover Offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in, into, from, or by the use of mails or any means or instrumentality (including, but not limited to, facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or of any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Takeover Offer may not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities.\nThe availability of the Alternative Offer pursuant to the Acquisition to Inspecs Shareholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom or the ability of those persons to hold such shares may be affected by the laws or regulatory requirements of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are resident. Persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Inspecs Shareholders who are in any doubt about such matters should consult an appropriate independent professional adviser in the relevant jurisdiction without delay.\nFurther details in relation to Overseas Shareholders are contained in the Scheme Document.\nNotice to US investors\nThe Acquisition relates to the securities of a company organised under the laws of England and Wales and is proposed to be effected by means of a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act. This Announcement, the Scheme Document and certain other documents relating to the Acquisition have been or will be prepared in accordance with English law, the AIM Rules, the Takeover Code and UK disclosure requirements, and the format and style applicable to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act, all of which differ from those in the United States. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules of Section 14(e) or the proxy solicitation rules of Section 14(a) under the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Scheme is subject to the disclosure requirements of and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes of arrangement, which differ from the disclosure requirements and practices of the United States tender offer and proxy solicitation rules.\nInspecs' financial statements, and all financial information that is included in this Announcement or that may be included in the Scheme Document, or any other documents relating to the Acquisition, have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom and thus may not be comparable to financial statements of companies in the United States or other companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. US generally accepted principles differ in certain respects from the UK adopted International Accounting Standards. None of the financial information in this Announcement has been audited in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the US or the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the US.\nThe Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and may not be offered, sold, exercised, resold, transferred or delivered, directly or indirectly, in or into the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. The Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes\nare expected to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act provided by section 3(a)(10) thereof. Section 3(a)(10) exempts securities issued in specified exchange transactions from the registration requirement under the US Securities Act where, among other things, the fairness of the terms and conditions of the issuance and exchange of such securities have been approved by a court or governmental authority expressly authorised by law to grant such approval, after a hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions of the exchange at which all persons to whom the Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes are proposed to be issued have the right to appear and receive adequate and timely notice thereof. If the exemption afforded by section 3(a)(10) is not available to Bidco, then Bidco expects to avail itself of another available exemption to the registration requirements under the US Securities Act. If Bidco exercises its right to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer, the Consideration Shares and the Consideration Loan Notes\nwill not be offered in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to registration under the US Securities Act.\nNeither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any US state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the Alternative Offer or determined if the Scheme Document is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence.\nIn accordance with normal UK practice and pursuant to Rule 14e-5(b) of the US Exchange Act (to the extent applicable), Bidco, its nominees or its brokers (acting as agents) may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Inspecs Shares outside of the US, other than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the Acquisition becomes Effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. If such purchases or arrangements to purchase were to be made, they would be made outside of the US and would be in accordance with applicable law, including the US Exchange Act and the Takeover Code. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com.\nIt may be difficult for US holders of Inspecs Shares to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under US federal securities laws in connection with the Acquisition, since Inspecs is organised under the laws of a country other than the United States, and some or all of its officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States, and most of the assets of Inspecs are located outside of the United States. US holders of Inspecs Shares may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of US federal securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's jurisdiction or judgment.\nIf Bidco were to elect to implement the Acquisition by means of a Takeover Offer, such Takeover Offer may be made in compliance with applicable US securities laws and regulations including, to the extent applicable, Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act and Regulation 14E thereunder, and will be made in accordance with the Takeover Code. Such a Takeover Offer may be made in the United States by Bidco and no one else. Accordingly, the Acquisition may be subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those applicable under US domestic tender offer procedures and law.\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the Acquisition by an Inspecs Shareholder in the United States as consideration for the transfer of its Inspecs Shares pursuant to the Scheme will likely be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under any applicable United States state and local income tax laws. Each Inspecs Shareholder in the United States is urged to consult its independent professional tax or legal adviser immediately regarding the US federal, state and local income and non-income tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to it, as well as any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis Announcement (including information incorporated by reference in this Announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by Bidco and Inspecs contain statements which are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\". Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of Bidco and Inspecs about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on Bidco and Inspecs (including their future prospects, developments and strategies), the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"prepares\", \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"is subject to\", \"budget\", \"projects\", \"synergy\", \"strategy\", \"scheduled\", \"goal\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"cost-saving\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"should\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of Bidco's, any member of the Bidco Group's, Inspecs' or any member of the Inspecs Group's operations and potential synergies resulting from the Acquisition; and (iii) the effects of global economic conditions and governmental regulation on Bidco's, Inspecs' or any member of the Bidco Group's or Inspecs Group's business.\nAlthough Bidco and Inspecs believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, Bidco and Inspecs can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, and no undue reliance should be placed on any such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to: the ability to complete the Acquisition; the ability to obtain requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals and the satisfaction of other Conditions on the proposed terms and schedule; changes in the global political, economic, business and competitive environments and in market and regulatory forces; changes in future exchange and interest rates; changes in tax rates; future business combinations or disposals; changes in general economic and business conditions; changes in the behaviour of other market participants; changes in the anticipated benefits from the proposed transaction not being realised as a result of changes in general economic and market conditions in the countries in which Bidco, the Bidco Group, Inspecs and the Inspecs Group operate, weak, volatile or illiquid capital and/or credit markets, changes in tax rates, interest rate and currency value fluctuations, the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which Bidco and Inspecs operate and changes in laws or in supervisory expectations or requirements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected in the forward-looking statements. If any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialises or if any one or more of the assumptions proves incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither Bidco nor Inspecs, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this Announcement will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place any reliance on these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only at the date of this Announcement. All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to Bidco or any member of the Wider Bidco Group or the Wider Inspecs Group, or any of their respective associates, directors, officers, employees or advisers, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations, neither Bidco nor Inspecs is under any obligation, and Bidco and Inspecs expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nDealing and Opening Position Disclosure Requirements\nUnder Rule 8.3(a) of the Takeover Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.\nUnder Rule 8.3(b) of the Takeover Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing.\nIf two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.\nOpening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).\nDetails of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel's Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.\nNo profit forecasts, estimates or quantified financial benefits statements\nNo statement in this Announcement is intended as, or is to be construed as, a profit forecast, profit estimate or quantified financial benefits statement for any period and no statement in this Announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for Inspecs for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share for Inspecs.\nRequesting hard copy documents\nIn accordance with Rule 30.3 of the Takeover Code, Inspecs Shareholders and participants in the Inspecs Share Plans may request a hard copy of this Announcement, free of charge, by contacting the Company's registrar, Equiniti Limited, during business hours on +44 (0) 371 384 2050 or by submitting a request in writing to Equiniti Limited, Corporate Actions, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex, BN99 6DA, with an address to which the hard copy may be sent. Calls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. For persons who receive a copy of this Announcement in electronic form or via a website notification, a hard copy of this Announcement will not be sent unless so requested. In accordance with Rule 30.3 of the Takeover Code, such persons may also request that all future documents, announcements and information to be sent to them in relation to the Acquisition should be in hard copy form.\nElectronic communications\nPlease be aware that addresses, electronic addresses and certain other information provided by Inspecs Shareholders, persons with information rights and other relevant persons for the receipt of communications from Inspecs may be provided to Bidco during the offer period as required under Section 4 of Appendix 4 of the Takeover Code to comply with Rule 2.11(c) of the Takeover Code.\nRounding\nCertain figures included in this Announcement have been subjected to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them.\nAPPENDIX\nEXPECTED TIMETABLE OF PRINCIPAL EVENTS\nEvent\nExpected time/date\n(9)(10)\nLatest time for lodging Forms of Proxy for the:\nCourt Meeting (BLUE Forms of Proxy)\n10.00 a.m. on 19 February 2026 (1)\nGeneral Meeting (WHITE Forms of Proxy)\n10.15 a.m. on 19 February 2026 (2)\nVoting Record Time for Court Meeting and General Meeting\n6.30 p.m. on 19 February 2026 (3)\nCourt Meeting\n10.00 a.m. on 23\nFebruary 2026\nGeneral Meeting\n10.15 a.m. on 23 February 2026\n(4)\nThe following dates are indicative only and are subject to change\n(5)\nSanction Hearing to sanction the Scheme\nA date (\"\nD\n\") to be determined following satisfaction or (if applicable) waiver of the Conditions set out in Part A (\nConditions to and Certain Further Terms of the Acquisition\n) of Part III of this document\nElection Withdrawal Deadline\n1.00 p.m. on D+1 Business Day\nElection Return Time (being the latest time for lodging the GREEN Form of Election or electing for the Alternative Offer through CREST)\n1.00 p.m. on D+1 Business Day (6)\nLast day of dealings in, and for registration of transfers of, and disablement in CREST of, Inspecs Shares\nAt close of business on D+1 Business Day\nScheme Record Time\n6.00 p.m. on D+1 Business Day\nSuspension of dealings in Inspecs Shares\n7.30 a.m. on D+2 Business Days\nEffective Date\nD+2 Business Days (7)\nCancellation of admission to trading of Inspecs Shares on AIM\nBy 8.00 a.m. on D+3 Business Days\nLatest date for dispatch of cheques and for settlement through CREST or other form of payment in respect of consideration due under the Scheme\nwithin 14 calendar days of the Effective Date\nLatest date for issue of the Consideration Shares and Consideration Loan Notes\nwithin 14 calendar days of the Effective Date\nLong Stop Date\n11.59 p.m. on 30 June 2026 (8)\nNotes\n:\n(1) It is requested that BLUE Forms of Proxy for the Court Meeting be lodged no later than 48 hours (excluding any part of such 48-hour period that is not a Business Day) before the time and date set for the Court Meeting or, if the Court Meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours before the time fixed for such adjourned Court Meeting (excluding any part of such 48-hour period that is not a Business Day).
