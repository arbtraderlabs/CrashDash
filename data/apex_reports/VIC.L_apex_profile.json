The consumer, whether directly or via the trade channel, increasingly chooses Victorian Plumbing as their bathroom and tiles retailer of choice because of our fair pricing, unrivalled high-quality product range and excellent stock availability.\nSummary of operating performance\nRevenue for the year grew by 5% to \u00a3310.0m (2024: \u00a3295.7m) outperforming the wider RMI market and reflecting an increase in total orders of 6% and a slight reduction in AOV of 1%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 17% to \u00a331.8m (2024: \u00a327.2m) and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 10% (2024: 9%).\nThe trend of consumers' switching to higher margin own brand product over recent years has slowed as anticipated, with own brand sales representing 81% of total revenue, which is in line with the second half of the last financial year.\nOnline marketing continues to be more efficient and aids the continued strategic investment in the brand which, in turn, drives more marketing efficiency. The investment in brand reflects the creation of new marketing content designed to drive profitable growth following the discontinuation of Victoria Plum in November 2024, and to capitalise on the increased capacity unlocked by the finalisation of our warehouse transformation programme in December 2024.\nThis performance proves the resilience of our business model and our competitive advantage irrespective of consumer sentiment, underpinning our confidence in delivering short, medium and long-term profitable growth.\nVictorian Plumbing (LFL)\nOutperforming the wider RMI market, on a like-for-like basis (excluding the impact of Victoria Plum), we report revenue growth of 9% at \u00a3306.0m (2024: \u00a3281.0m), reflecting an increase in total orders of 11% and a decline in AOV of 2% to \u00a3288 (2024: \u00a3294). The second half of the financial year saw a 13% increase in order volume and 2% increase in AOV, resulting in a 15% increase in LFL revenue.\nThe introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility tax in April 2025, increased delivery charges and growth in trade and tiles and flooring revenues (both of which have a lower gross margin compared to the average of the wider Group) have driven a small reduction in gross margin to 49.4% (2024: 50.0%).\nOnline marketing spend as a percentage of revenue decreased from 26.2% in 2024 to 24.6% in 2025, with brand marketing spend increasing from 2.5% to 2.7% in the same period, resulting in overall marketing spend decreasing from 28.7% in 2024 to 27.3% in 2025.\nProgress on our strategic focus\u00a0areas\nWe continue to leverage our market and brand position, as well as our strong balance sheet, to deliver on our clearly defined strategic objectives, which focus on core B2C, expansion categories and trade.\nOur core market is retailing bathroom and tile products and accessories to\u202fUK consumers through our market leading online platform. As previously highlighted, there is still a considerable way to go before the consumer transition to online purchasing of bathroom products and accessories reaches maturity. We are particularly well placed to continue to gain further market share in the short-term through these structural tailwinds and by taking share from traditional physical retailers, omnichannel players and other online competitors.\nIn line with our medium-term strategy, we are considering opportunities for focused international expansion and vertical integration in our supply chain. In particular, we are already delivering an increasing amount of order volume to the Republic of Ireland through our UK domain, which could facilitate some focused and disciplined investment to better serve this growth market in the future.\nGiven our market leading position in the bathroom product and accessories market, and our firm footing in the tiles market following a year of stellar growth, we have exciting opportunities to expand our reach into additional areas, such as our planned expansion into homewares through MFI, our recently launched online furniture and homewares brand.\nDuring 2025, our trade revenue grew by 10% to \u00a373.8m (2024: \u00a367.3m), representing 24% (2024: 23%) of our total revenue, compared with an estimated 50:50 split across the wider market17. Our primary targets to date have been smaller, independent traders, and we believe we can make meaningful market share gains by broadening our marketing approach, including via targeted radio advertising, expanding the range of relevant products we offer to trade customers, and by continually improving our platforms so that they are more tailored to suit trade customers' needs. The marketing investment in sports sponsorship during the year further strengthens our brand awareness amongst tradespeople and, along with the investment in our dedicated trade team, means we are well placed to attract trade customers and drive further growth in trade revenue.\nStrengthening our competitive position\nWe are the UK's largest bathroom retailer, and during 2025 we have continued to strengthen our competitive moat by improving the customer journey through innovative technology enhancements and category expansion.\nOur investment in marketing continues to increase brand awareness and supports customer acquisition, as consumers respond positively to the bold and distinctive Victorian Plumbing brand. We have renewed our partnership with Bolton Wanderers Football Club as its title and front of shirt sponsor for a further three years. We also renewed our partnership with the World Snooker Tour as the headline sponsor of the Victorian Plumbing UK Championship 2025, part of snooker's Triple Crown Series, following our success in November 2024 which attracted over 14 million BBC TV viewers.\nOur creative offline content is complemented by our investment in increasingly targeted digital performance-based marketing. This dynamic marketing strategy, together with our bold marketing campaign 'Boss Your Bathroom', has further improved our strong brand awareness score to 70% (2024: 66%).\nAs an online retailer, we continue to benefit from the ongoing structural shift in consumer buying behaviour from offline to online. Online sales represented c.27% of total retail sales in 202518, and we expect our addressable market to grow even further in the coming years.\nA one-stop shop for bathroom products and\u202faccessories\nOffering customers a wide selection of products across a variety of\u202fprice points ensures that we are the true one-stop solution for any bathroom-related purchase. As at 30 September 2025, we have increased the number of available products to more than 37,000 from over 150 brands, ensuring there is something available, affordable and suitable for\u202feveryone.\nThe relationships that we have developed over time with well-known third party brands enable us to complement our own brand offerings, which are exclusively available on the Victorian Plumbing website. We have developed over 25 own brands using our in-house product development team, and these are increasingly popular with customers. In 2025, 81% of revenue generated came from own brand products including Stonehouse Studio, our in-house tile range (2024: 80%). This unique own brand proposition alongside established third party brands helps to ensure that profitability is maintained, irrespective of wider market conditions, and is testament to the resilience of the business model.\nA bold strategic expansion into a high-value adjacency\nIn alignment with our long-term growth strategy, we executed a soft launch of the reimagined MFI homewares e-commerce platform in the UK in July 2025. This initiative followed the acquisition of the MFI brand and its premium three-letter domain, as part of the Victoria Plum transaction in May 2024.\nMFI is positioned to deliver stylish, design-led homewares tailored to the modern online consumer. The brand targets a broader demographic, including both homeowners and renters, thereby expanding the Group's addressable market. This move marks our entry into the \u00a321 billion homewares category19 - a significant adjacency to our core business - enabling us to diversify revenue streams and mitigate concentration risk.\nThe launch leverages Victorian Plumbing's proprietary technology stack, e-commerce expertise, purchasing scale, and logistics infrastructure, ensuring operational efficiency and accelerated market entry. The revitalised MFI brand is already demonstrating conversion rates in line with Group benchmarks, validating our strategic approach.\nOperating as a digital-only business, MFI is supported by a dedicated leadership team and warehousing capabilities. The product offering includes a curated selection of textiles, home d\u00e9cor, and freestanding furniture, with a tiered pricing strategy (\"good, better, best\") designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer segments.\nAgile supply chain\nShipping costs did not change materially during 2025. The year-on-year improvement in the strength of GBP to USD, if maintained, bodes well but there remains a significant level of unpredictability in financial markets. We have not seen any improvement to gate prices from China but we continue to work with our suppliers to maximise financial performance. Third party delivery cost prices increased in the second half of the year as a result of suppliers passing on inflationary cost pressures resulting from the increase in National Living Wage and National Insurance Contributions in April 2025.\nRegardless of the macroeconomic conditions, by leveraging the positive working relationships we have with our shipping partners, as well as those built with our long-standing global suppliers, we have avoided supply chain disruption - also evidencing the benefit of scale we have achieved in recent years.\nThroughout the expansion of our categories, we also work closely with tile and flooring manufacturers, many of whom are based in Southern Europe and have worked to ensure margins are closely aligned with the existing Group margin.\nSeamless customer journey\nWe are extremely proud that we continue to be rated 'Excellent' by Trustpilot and have improved our average score in the year to 4.4 out of 5.0 from a low of 4.3 in the first half, having smoothed out some teething issues in our new warehouse infrastructure (2024: 4.6).\nWe received a record number of reviews via Trustpilot during the year and as a Group have surpassed 415,000 reviews in total, the highest of any specialist bathroom retailer on the site. The 'Excellent' rating we have across this volume of reviews is testament to the dedicated work of our colleagues.\nWe are also delighted that our newly launched brand, MFI, is rated 'Excellent' by Trustpilot with an average score in the year of 4.7 - leveraging our existing customer services know-how to deliver the best customer experience.\nDevelopment of our technology platforms\nOur growing Technology Development and Infrastructure teams work hard to facilitate the continual development of our bespoke technology platforms to ensure we remain best-in-class across online retail.\nThere has been significant work undertaken over recent years to completely re-platform the website in order to improve its functionality and scalability. We have also introduced a newly designed structure to give prominence to our expansion categories, enhanced our search functionality to include AI features, and introduced other developments, such as improved customer optionality in product selection. These strategic developments have supported an increase in user conversion from 3.8ppt in 2024 to 3.9ppt in 202520. Overall, 2% (2024: 2%) of Victorian Plumbing revenue was generated through the app.\nIn addition, the Technology Development team successfully enhanced our existing warehouse management system alongside a larger project to transform warehouse operations. By performing this work in-house, we can better control costs, improve quality, and provide more certainty over the benefits that the improved technology brings.\nThe MFI website and supporting systems were also developed by our in-house team, taking advantage of the knowledge and expertise they developed at Victorian Plumbing.\nNew distribution centre\nWe achieved legal completion on the 20-year lease of our new 544,000 square feet DC on 4 October 2023 and became fully operational, as planned and within budget, by the end of December 2024.\nESG\nTaking responsibility is one of our core values, and we are clear that every one of us has a role to play in making a positive difference to the environment and the communities in which we operate. Our ESG strategy is centred around three focus areas: environmental sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and governance and ethics.\nOur chosen charity is Liverpool Zoe's Place, which supports babies and young children who have complex illnesses or disabilities that are terminal or life limiting from birth to age five.\nOur electricity contracts remain 100% renewable, and we continue to work with suppliers to reduce the levels of plastic packaging on our products. We have installed photovoltaic panels on the new DC to ensure we are maximising the renewable energy source opportunities available to us.\nOur people\nAs a Board, we continue to be impressed by the commitment and capability of our people; collectively, their innovation and hard work have been the driving force behind the growth and success experienced by the Group over recent years. We are proud of the values-led, principles-driven culture that is deep-rooted throughout Victorian Plumbing, and it is this culture that underpins our ability to adapt and respond positively to challenges.\nRecent hires in MFI from well-established homewares businesses in the UK have added to our ever growing pool of talent and bring fresh perspectives which complement the existing culture in the Group.\nCurrent trading and outlook\nThe Group has had a positive start to the current financial year with continued revenue growth across all categories, and in line with market expectation.\nMFI continues to build its product range ahead of a full launch in 2026\nand whilst revenue is building, our expectation for MFI to incur an overall loss of between \u00a32.6m and \u00a33.4m in the current year remains unchanged.\nWe continue to focus on our long-term goals and are making good progress across our strategic growth areas. Underpinned by our market share gains in recent years, together with operational improvements, we are confident in the future financial prospects of the Group, notwithstanding that we continue to operate against a volatile consumer and economic backdrop.\nFinancial review\nIntroduction\nThe performance of the Group continued to be strong with ongoing momentum in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nChange\n%\nRevenue\n310.0\n295.7\n5%\nCost of sales\n(156.8)\n(147.9)\n(6%)\nGross profit\n153.2\n147.8\n4%\nGross profit margin (%)\n49.4%\n50.0%\n(0.6ppt)\nUnderlying Costs\n(121.4)\n(120.6)\n(1%)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n31.8\n27.2\n17%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n(%)\n10%\n9%\n1ppt\nDepreciation and amortisation\n(7.8)\n(4.7)\n(66%)\nShare-based payments (including NI)\n(1.4)\n(3.1)\n55%\nExceptional items\n(4.6)\n(8.2)\n44%\nOperating Profit\n18.0\n11.2\n61%\nNet finance (costs) / income\n(2.2)\n0.6\n(467%)\nExceptional finance costs\n(0.7)\n(2.8)\n75%\nProfit before tax\n15.1\n9.0\n68%\nAdjusted profit before tax\n21.8\n23.1\n(6%)\nRevenue\nReported revenue grew by 5% to \u00a3310.0m in 2025, from \u00a3295.7m in 2024. Order volume grew by 6% to a record 1,080,000, with AOV declining by 1% to \u00a3287 in the same period. The average number of items per basket increased to 3.3 in 2025 (2024: 3.1), driven by growth in our trade channel.\nOrder growth reflects continued market share gain in a subdued market, driven by the acquisition of Victoria Plum in May 2024 and our unrelenting approach to online marketing, as well as improved brand awareness.\nThe reduction in AOV reflects a continuation of the customer shift away from more expensive third party brands to our own brand product range, which carries a higher margin, albeit the rate of this shift slowed during the second half of the year, such that AOV in H2 was up 3% to \u00a3292 vs. H1. The revenue split between own brand and third party brands was 81% vs. 19% (2024: 80% vs. 20%). Importantly, and in contrast to our competitors which operate more expensive business models, the Group has not passed on any price increases during the year as it looked to support the consumer during a difficult and uncertain period and to ensure our pricing remains competitive.\nTrade revenue, driven by higher order volumes, grew by 10% to \u00a373.8m (2024: \u00a367.3m) and now represents 24% of total revenue (2024: 23%). Consumer revenue (including MFI) increased by 3% to \u00a3236.2m (2024: \u00a3228.4m) and represents 76% of total revenue (2024: 77%), driven by order growth following the acquisition of Victoria Plum.\nRevenue continued to grow at pace in our expansion categories as space constraints were unlocked in our new DC. Tiles and flooring revenue grew by 42% to \u00a317.6m (2024: \u00a312.4m), albeit at a slightly reduced gross margin when compared with the wider core bathroom range.\nGross profit\nWe define gross profit as revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes all direct costs incurred in purchasing products for resale along with packaging, distribution, and transaction costs (which include mark to market movements on forward currency contractual arrangements in line with our treasury policy).\nCost of sales increased by 6% to \u00a3156.8m (2024: \u00a3147.9m) in line with order volume growth.\nG\nross profit for the year increased by 4% to \u00a3153.2m (2024: \u00a3147.8m). Gross profit margin reduced by 60 basis points to 49.4% (2024: 50.0%)\nreflecting the introduction of Extended Producer Responsibility tax effective from 1 April 2025 and a change in product category and channel mix across the year.\nGross margin from own brand products was stable at 54% (2024: 54%), and gross margin from third party products reduced to 30% (2024: 32%).\nWe are proud to partner with some of the industry's leading names which, alongside our own brand offering, allows us to provide consumers with a wide range of price points. This is a compelling component of our unique ungeared operating model, protecting shareholder returns and building the foundation for future growth.\nUnderlying costs\nUnderlying costs, which we define as administrative expenses before depreciation and amortisation, exceptional items and share-based payments, increased by 1% to \u00a3121.4m (2024: \u00a3120.6m) and represents 39% of revenue (2024: 41%).\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nChange\nMarketing - online\n76.1\n78.2\n(3%)\nMarketing - brand\n8.5\n7.2\n18%\nTotal marketing\n84.6\n85.4\n(1%)\nPeople costs (excluding share-based payments)\n26.6\n24.7\n8%\nProperty & other overheads\n10.2\n10.5\n(3%)\nUnderlying costs\n121.4\n120.6\n1%\nGrowing the Victorian Plumbing brand awareness and increasing traffic to site remains a focus for the Group and we have seen a material improvement in our brand awareness score during the year to 70% (2024: 66%). Total marketing costs decreased by 1% to \u00a384.6m (2024: \u00a385.4m) and represent 27.3% (2024: 28.9%) of total revenue. Online marketing costs decreased by 3% to \u00a376.1m (2024: \u00a378.2m) representing 24.6% (2024: 26.5%) of total revenue, which we consider an excellent performance and reflects our brand strength improvement and in-house marketing expertise. Investment in brand spend, including our\ntitle sponsorship of the UK Snooker Championship\nand TV and outdoor advertising, increased to \u00a38.5m (2024: \u00a37.2m), representing 3% of total revenue (2024: 2%).\nPeople costs, excluding share-based payments but including costs relating to agency staff, increased 8% to \u00a326.6m (2024: \u00a324.7m).\nOverall average FTE decreased 2% to 712 (2024: 727).\nThis reflects well-documented inflationary cost pressures together with an investment in MFI offset, in part, by productivity improvements within our new warehouse infrastructure. Revenue per average FTE was \u00a3435,000 (2024: \u00a3407,000).\nProperty and other overhead costs reduced by 3% to \u00a310.2m (2024: \u00a310.5m), with the Group investing in dedicated warehousing for MFI in the second half of the financial year.\nProfit\nOperating profit and adjusted EBITDA\nThe Executive Leadership Team (\"ELT\") measures the overall performance of the Group by reference to adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. This adjusted profit measure is applied by the ELT to understand earnings trends and is considered an additional, useful measure under which to assess the Group's true operating performance.\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nOperating profit\n18.0\n11.2\nAmortisation of intangibles\n2.9\n3.1\nDepreciation of property, plant & equipment\n1.5\n0.5\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets\n3.4\n1.1\nShare-based payments (including NI)\n1.4\n3.1\n27.2\n19.0\nDouble running and non-recurring administrative expenses\n2.0\n5.7\nImpairment of right-of-use assets\n-\n0.8\nClosure costs: Victoria Plum\n2.4\n1.1\nProfessional fees associated with business combinations\n0.2\n0.6\n4.6\n8.2\nAdjusted EBITDA\n31.8\n27.2\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 17% to \u00a331.8m (2024: \u00a327.2m), and adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 1ppt to 10% (2024: 9%).\nAdjusted EBITDA to adjusted PBT\nThe ELT also measures the overall performance of the Group by reference to adjusted PBT, a non-GAAP measure.

In accordance with IFRS 16, a lease liability of \u00a341.7m has been recognised, with a corresponding right-of-use asset recognised in non-current assets during the prior financial year.\nFor the duration of the fit-out, the new warehouse was not generating economic benefit for the Group. Therefore, expenditure incurred during the fit-out period, together with non-recurring transformation costs such as associated professional fees, totalling \u00a32.1m (2024: \u00a35.7m) has been recognised as 'warehouse transformation costs' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Associated exceptional cash outflows of \u00a31.5m (2024: \u00a32.5m) have been incurred and recognised in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nThe imputed interest recognised against IFRS 16 lease liabilities for property considered to be non-underlying during the fit-out period have been recognised as 'double running finance costs'. Associated cash outflows of \u00a30.5m have been expended for double running finance costs during the period (2024: \u00a32.8m).\nClosure of Victoria Plum\nOn 17 May 2024, Victorian Plumbing Ltd, a subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Victoria Plum and, in August 2024, the decision was taken by the Group to cease trading Victoria Plum. The Victoria Plum website was redirected to Victorian Plumbing from November 2024. This closure activity meets the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. As such, the losses incurred together with the settlement of the balance sheet of Victoria Plum have been recognised as a \u00a39.1m cash outflow from discontinued operations in 2025. A provision of \u00a30.6m has been recognised as an exceptional item within continuing operations in the year against Victoria Plum inventory held by Victorian Plumbing.\nExceptional cash flows\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash outflow from exceptional items: warehouse transformation costs\n(1.5)\n(2.5)\nCash outflow from the closure costs\n-\n(0.8)\nCash flows from investing activities\nPurchase of intangible assets: exceptional items\n(0.1)\n(0.3)\nPurchase of property, plant and equipment: exceptional items\n(0.6)\n(20.8)\nCash flows from financing activities\nPayment of interest portion of lease liabilities: double running finance costs\n(0.5)\n(2.7)\nPayment of principal portion of lease liabilities: double running finance costs\n-\n(0.1)\nCash flows from exceptional items\n(2.7)\n(27.2)\nShare-based payments\nThe Group incurred share-based payment charges (including associated national insurance) of \u00a31.4m (2024: \u00a33.1m). Share-based payment charges for the year include \u00a30.7m (2024: \u00a31.7m) for schemes relating to the Group's IPO in June 2021, along with \u00a30.7m (2024: \u00a31.4m) for ongoing schemes put in place post IPO.\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment\nThe Group continues to invest in its platform and the development of bespoke in-house systems (including MFI), with \u00a33.9m of intangible assets capitalised during the year (2024: \u00a33.8m). Depreciation and amortisation increased by \u00a33.1m to \u00a37.8m (2024: \u00a34.7m) to reflect the additional expense of the fit-out of the new warehouse together with the associated right of use expense.\nNet finance costs\nFinance income of \u00a30.7m during the year compares to a finance income of \u00a31.0m for 2024 due to,\ninter alia\n, cash being placed on deposit to take advantage of deposit rates. Finance costs (excluding exceptional items) increased to \u00a32.9m (2024: \u00a30.4m) to reflect the additional interest on the 20-year lease associated with the new warehouse.\nTaxation\nThe Group tax charge of \u00a32.2m (2024: \u00a33.5m) represents an effective tax rate of 15% (2024: 39%) which is lower than the standard rate of UK tax of 25% due to tax losses being recognised in the year.\nEarnings per share\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations was 4.2 pence (2024: 1.7 pence). Adjusted diluted EPS grew by 2% to 5.4 pence (2024: 5.3 pence).\nCash flow and net cash\nThe Group continues to achieve strong cash generation with an increase in free cash flow of 29% to \u00a324.0m (2024: \u00a318.6m), resulting in strong operating cash conversion of 77% (2024: 68%).\nContinuing operations\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nAdjusted EBITDA\n31.3\n27.2\nMovement in working capital\n2.5\n(4.8)\nRepayment of lease liabilities\n(3.5)\n(1.3)\nVAT not yet recovered on exceptional items\n(1.6)\n1.2\nCapital expenditure (excluding exceptional items)\n(4.7)\n(3.7)\nFree cash flow\n24.0\n18.6\nOperating cash conversion\n77%\n68%\nChanges in working capital resulted in a cash inflow of \u00a32.5m (2024: outflow of \u00a34.8m),\nlargely because of timing differences with supplier payments. Given the nature of our stock, we continue to incur low levels of obsolescence and our proprietary knowledge over two decades of trading benefits us in low levels of returns and damages.\nCapital expenditure (excluding exceptional items) of \u00a34.7m (2024: \u00a33.7m) included \u00a33.6m (2024: \u00a33.3m) of capitalised salaries relating to development of the Group's bespoke software solutions.\nAt the end of the year, the Group had net cash (excluding IFRS 16 related liabilities) of \u00a317.7m (2024: \u00a311.2m).\nOn 18 December 2024, the Group entered into a new three-year revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") with HSBC, replacing the \u00a310m RCF which was due to expire in December 2025. The new RCF has total commitments of \u00a330m. The Group has provided a cross-guarantee by way of a debenture dated 7 June 2021 as security for the facility. The RCF remains undrawn at the date of this report.\nMFI\nMFI recognised revenue of \u00a30.1m in the first three months of trading following the soft launch in July 2025. Administrative expense of \u00a32.3m for people and property cost was recognised during the second half of the year. Depreciation and finance expense totalling \u00a30.3m has also been recognised during the second half of the year, resulting in a statutory and adjusted net loss before tax of \u00a32.5m.\nForecasting MFI continues to be a challenge given the limited amount of trading history.\nAs an entrepreneurial business we will react and adapt over time. Notwithstanding this, our current expectation is for MFI to incur an overall loss of between \u00a32.6m and \u00a33.4m in 2026.\nDividend\nVictorian Plumbing has a robust balance sheet, generates significant operating cashflows and the underlying priority is to reinvest into the business and drive further profitable growth. In H1 2025, the Board implemented a revised capital allocation policy with the aim of maintaining a dividend cover ratio of 2.25x - 3.00x (previously 3.00x - 3.50x). This recognises that most growth opportunities do not require significant capital, and reflects confidence in the Group's ongoing strength, future growth prospects and cash generation.\nIn order to distribute a total ordinary dividend for the year of 2.15 pence per share (2024: 1.61 pence per share), which would represent growth of 34%, the Board is recommending a full year final ordinary dividend of 1.45 pence per share (2024: 1.09 pence per share). This would represent dividend cover for 2025 of 2.5x (2024: 3.3x).\nIf approved, this would result in a total cash distribution to shareholders of \u00a37.2m (\u00a32.3m interim paid and \u00a34.9m final to be paid) (2024: total cash distribution to shareholders \u00a35.2m), subject to shareholders' approval at the AGM on 25 February 2026. The final dividend will be paid on 4 March 2026 to shareholders on the register of members at the close of business on 6 February 2026.\nDaniel Barton\nChief Financial Officer\n2 December 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nNote\nContinuing operations\n\u00a3m\nDiscontinued operations\n\u00a3m\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nRevenue\n4\n306.1\n3.9\n310.0\n295.7\nCost of sales\n(154.3)\n(2.5)\n(156.8)\n(147.9)\nGross profit\n151.8\n1.4\n153.2\n147.8\nAdministrative expenses\n5\n(132.6)\n(2.6)\n(135.2)\n(135.8)\nImpairment of assets\n-\n-\n-\n(0.8)\nOperating profit / (loss)\n19.2\n(1.2)\n18.0\n11.2\nFinance income\n7\n0.7\n-\n0.7\n1.0\nFinance costs\n7\n(3.6)\n-\n(3.6)\n(3.2)\nProfit / (loss) before tax\n16.3\n(1.2)\n15.1\n9.0\nIncome tax expense\n8\n(2.5)\n0.3\n(2.2)\n(3.5)\nProfit / (loss) for the year\n13.8\n(0.9)\n12.9\n5.5\nLoss from discontinued operations\n-\n(0.9)\n(0.9)\n-\nProfit from continuing operations\n13.8\n-\n13.8\n5.5\nBasic earnings per share (pence)\n10\n4.5\n(0.3)\n4.2\n1.8\nDiluted earnings per share (pence)\n10\n4.2\n(0.3)\n3.9\n1.7\nThere are no items to be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the current year or prior year, and hence the Group has not presented a separate statement of other comprehensive income.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAT 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nNote\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nAssets\nNon-current assets\nGoodwill\n18.8\n18.8\nIntangible assets\n13\n4.7\n4.7\nProperty, plant and equipment\n14\n26.8\n27.8\nRight-of-use assets\n15\n47.3\n45.4\n97.6\n96.7\nCurrent assets\nInventories\n45.6\n43.7\nTrade and other receivables\n16\n7.5\n6.9\nCash and cash equivalents\n17.7\n11.2\n70.8\n61.8\nTotal assets\n168.4\n158.5\nEquity and liabilities\nEquity attributable to the owners of the Company\nShare capital\n20\n0.3\n0.3\nShare premium\n11.2\n11.2\nCapital redemption reserve\n0.1\n0.1\nCapital reorganisation reserve\n(320.6)\n(320.6)\nRetained earnings\n369.6\n361.3\nTotal equity\n60.6\n52.3\nLiabilities\nNon-current liabilities\nLease liabilities\n18\n47.5\n43.0\nDerivative financial instruments\n-\n0.5\nProvisions\n2.0\n1.9\nDeferred tax liability\n1.6\n2.8\n51.1\n48.2\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n17\n45.0\n44.5\nContract liabilities\n6.8\n9.5\nLease liabilities\n18\n3.6\n3.1\nProvisions\n0.2\n0.7\nCorporation tax\n1.1\n0.2\n56.7\n58.0\nTotal liabilities\n107.8\n106.2\nTotal equity and liabilities\n168.4\n158.5\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 2 December 2025 and authorised for issue.\nDaniel Barton\nChief Financial Officer\nVictorian Plumbing Group plc\nRegistered number: 13379554\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nShare capital\n\u00a3m\nShare premium\n\u00a3m\nCapital redemption reserve\n\u00a3m\nCapital reorganisation reserve \u00a3m\nRetained earnings\n\u00a3m\nTotal equity\n\u00a3m\nBalance at 1 October 2023\n0.3\n11.2\n0.1\n(320.6)\n357.8\n48.8\nComprehensive income\nProfit for the year\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5.5\n5.5\nTransactions with owners\nDividends paid\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(4.8)\n(4.8)\nEmployee share schemes -

General information\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and on the historical cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.\nThe financial information set out in this document does not constitute the statutory accounts of the Group for the financial years ended 30 September 2025 or 30 September 2024 but is derived from the 2025 Annual Report and Financial Statements. The Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2025 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in due course. The auditors have reported on those accounts and have given an unqualified report, which does not contain a statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\nGoing concern\nThe Group's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on maintaining adequate levels of resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. When assessing the going concern of the Group, the Directors have reviewed the year to date financial results, as well as detailed financial forecasts for the period up to 31 January 2027. The assumptions used in the financial forecasts are based on the Group's historical performance and management's extensive experience of the industry. Taking into consideration the wider economic environment, the forecasts have been assessed and stress tested to ensure that a robust assessment of the Group's working capital and cash requirements has been performed.\nAt 30 September 2025, the Group held instantly accessible cash of \u00a317.7m. The Group also had access to a revolving credit facility of \u00a330.0m with HSBC which was undrawn at 30 September 2025. On 18 December 2024, the Group entered into a three year agreement with HSBC for a \u00a330m revolving credit facility. The Group has sufficient liquidity headroom through the forecast period. The Directors therefore have reasonable expectation that the Group has the financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 January 2027. Accordingly, the Directors conclude it is appropriate that these consolidated financial statements be prepared on a going concern basis.\n2. Accounting policies, estimates and judgements\nThe accounting policies applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 September 2024 unless stated below.\nJudgements in applying accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty\n2.1 Accounting judgements\nBusiness combinations\nThe acquisition method of accounting is applied in accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and measured at cost, representing the excess of the aggregate of the consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. The consideration is measured at fair value, which is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangibles\nGoodwill was recognised upon the acquisition of AHK Designs Limited trading as Victoria Plum (\"Victoria Plum\"). The goodwill represents the removal of a nuisance factor, being the competing brand with a similar name. The goodwill arising upon this acquisition has been allocated to the main Group's CGU, Victorian Plumbing. The CGU of Victorian Plumbing has been assessed for impairment and at that level there is no indication of impairment.\nAn impairment review of other intangible assets, being 'computer software' and 'assets under construction' has been performed and due to the growth enabling features and efficiency gains it was concluded that the future value of the investments made is greater than the carrying value. Any assets held in the 'assets under construction' category will be brought into use during the year ended 30 September 2026.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets relate to the development of the Group's internal bespoke software solutions and comprise both capitalised internal salaries and third party costs. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management's judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model.\n2.2 Sources of estimation uncertainty\nRefund liability and right of return asset\nThe refund liability that is recognised within the consolidated financial statements relates to the obligation to refund some or all of the consideration received from a customer. The liability is measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects it will have to return to the customer. The refund liability therefore requires management to estimate the amount expected to be returned to customers after the reporting date.\nThe refund liability and associated right of return asset are estimated using historical rates of the level of refunds relative to revenue.\n2025\n2024\nRevenue (\u00a3m)\n310.0\n295.7\nRefund liability (\u00a3m)\n0.9\n0.8\nRefund liability % average quarterly sales\n1.0%\n1.1%\nRight of return asset (\u00a3m)\n0.3\n0.3\nRight of return asset % average quarterly sales\n0.4%\n0.4%\nThe impact on profit before taxation (\"PBT\") of increasing the refund rate by 100% would be a reduction of \u00a30.9m (2024: \u00a30.8m).\nWarranty provision\nThe Group provides for the cost expected to be incurred in order to replace damaged or faulty items that existed at the time of sale. The provision related to these assurance-type warranties are recognised when the product is sold. Initial recognition is based on historical experience.\nThe warranty provision is estimated with reference to the historical level of credit notes raised relative to revenue.\n2025\n2024\nRevenue for the period (\u00a3m)\n310.0\n295.7\nWarranty provision (\u00a3m)\n0.3\n0.3\nWarranty provision % average quarterly sales\n0.4%\n0.4%\nThe impact on PBT of increasing the warranty provision by 100% would be a reduction of \u00a30.3m (2024: \u00a30.3m).\nInventory provision\nManagement has evaluated the level of inventory held and the ageing of inventory in order to consider the need for a provision over stock to cover either slow-moving items, obsolete items or items which the Group may sell at lower than cost. This has resulted in a provision of \u00a30.6m being recognised in the period (2024: \u00a3nil). The impact on PBT of increasing the inventory provision by 100% would be a reduction of \u00a30.6m (2024: \u00a3nil).\n3. Segmental information\nIFRS 8 'Operating Segments' requires the Group to determine its operating segments based on information that is provided internally. Based on the internal reporting information and management structures within the Group, it has been determined that there are three operating segments: Victorian Plumbing, MFI and Victoria Plum, as the three entities are clearly and separately reported on internally. There is also considered to be three reporting segments; Victorian Plumbing, MFI and Victoria Plum. MFI is a new segment this year, having commenced trading in 2025.\nManagement has determined that there are three operating and reporting segments based on the reports reviewed by the ELT, which is the chief operating decision-maker (\"CODM\"). The ELT is made up of the Executive Directors and Key Management and is responsible for the strategic decision-making of the Group.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe ELT measures the overall performance of the Operating Group by reference to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. This adjusted profit measure is applied by the ELT to understand the earnings trends of the Operating Group and is considered an additional, useful measure under which to assess the true operating performance of the Operating Group.\nThe Directors believe that these items and adjusted measures of performance should be separately disclosed in order to assist in the understanding of financial performance achieved by the Operating Group and for consistency with prior years.\nAdjusted PBT\nThe ELT also measures the overall performance of the Operating Group by reference to adjusted profit before tax (\"PBT\"), a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted PBT is defined as adjusted EBITDA less interest, depreciation and amortisation.\nThis adjusted profit measure is applied by the ELT as an alternative profitability measure, which incorporates the capital investment and the financing structure of the Group.\nVictorian Plumbing \u00a3m\nMFI\n\u00a3m\nContinuing operations \u00a3m\nVictoria Plum\n\u00a3m\n2025\nVictorian Plumbing \u00a3m\nVictoria Plum\n\u00a3m\n2024\nRevenue\n306.0\n0.1\n306.1\n3.9\n310.0\n281.0\n14.7\n295.7\nCost of sales\n(154.3)\n(0.0)\n(154.3)\n(2.5)\n(156.8)\n(139.3)\n(8.6)\n(147.9)\nGross profit\n151.7\n0.1\n151.8\n1.4\n153.2\n141.7\n6.1\n147.8\nAdministrative expenses\n(118.2)\n(2.3)\n(120.5)\n(0.9)\n(121.4)\n(112.3)\n(8.3)\n(120.6)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n33.5\n(2.2)\n31.3\n0.5\n31.8\n29.4\n(2.2)\n27.2\nNet finance costs\n(2.1)\n(0.1)\n(2.2)\n-\n(2.2)\n0.6\n-\n0.6\nAmortisation and depreciation\n(7.6)\n(0.2)\n(7.8)\n-\n(7.8)\n(4.7)\n-\n(4.7)\nAdjusted profit before tax\n23.8\n(2.5)\n21.3\n0.5\n21.8\n25.3\n(2.2)\n23.1\nExceptional items\n(3.6)\n-\n(3.6)\n(1.7)\n(5.3)\n(10.1)\n(0.9)\n(11.0)\nShare-based payments (including NI)\n(1.4)\n-\n(1.4)\n-\n(1.4)\n(3.1)\n-\n(3.1)\nProfit before tax\n18.8\n(2.5)\n16.3\n(1.2)\n15.1\n12.1\n(3.1)\n9.0\n4.

In accordance with IFRS 16, a lease liability of \u00a341.7m has been recognised, with a corresponding right-of-use asset recognised in non-current assets during the prior financial year.\nFor the duration of the fit-out, the DC was not generating economic benefit for the Group. Therefore, operating expenditure incurred during the fit-out period, together with non-recurring transformation costs such as associated professional fees, totalling \u00a32.0m (2024: \u00a35.7m) has been recognised as 'warehouse transformation costs' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. During 2025, associated exceptional cash outflows of \u00a31.5m (2024: \u00a32.5m) have been incurred and recognised in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nThe imputed interest recognised against IFRS 16 lease liabilities for property considered to be non-underlying during the fit-out period have been recognised as 'double running finance costs'. Associated cash outflows of \u00a30.5m have been expended for double running finance costs during the period (2024: \u00a32.8m).\nClosure of Victoria Plum\nOn 17 May 2024, Victorian Plumbing Ltd, a subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Victoria Plum and, in August 2024, the decision was taken by the Group to cease trading Victoria Plum. The Victoria Plum website was redirected to Victorian Plumbing from November 2024. This closure activity meets the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. As such, the losses incurred together with the settlement of the balance sheet of Victoria Plum have been recognised as a \u00a39.1m cash outflow from discontinued operations in 2025. A provision of \u00a30.6m has been recognised as an exceptional item within continuing operations in the year against Victoria Plum inventory held by Victorian Plumbing.\nc.

The dividends will be paid on 4 March 2026 to shareholders on the register of members at the close of business on 6 February 2026.\n10. Earnings per share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share (\"EPS\") is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.\nDiluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the number of incremental ordinary shares, calculated using the treasury stock method, that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.\nThe following table reflects the income and share data used in the EPS calculations:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\nTotal earnings\n\u00a3m\nPence per share\nYear ended 30 September 2025\nBasic EPS from continuing operations\n314,295,920\n13.8\n4.5\nBasic EPS from discontinued operations\n314,295,920\n(0.9)\n(0.3)\nBasic EPS\n314,295,920\n12.9\n4.2\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations\n331,111,216\n13.8\n4.2\nDiluted EPS from discontinued operations\n331,111,216\n(0.9)\n(0.3)\nDiluted EPS\n331,111,216\n12.9\n3.9\nYear ended 30 September 2024\nBasic EPS\n294,908,792\n5.5\n1.8\nDiluted EPS\n327,498,168\n5.5\n1.7\nThe number of shares in issue at the start of the year is reconciled to the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares\u00a0below:\n2025\n2024\nWeighted average number of shares for basic EPS\n314,295,920\n294,908,792\nDilutive impact of unvested shares in relation to share awards\n16,815,296\n32,589,376\nWeighted average number of shares for diluted EPS\n331,111,216\n327,498,168\nThe average market value of the Group's shares for the purposes of calculating the dilutive effect of share-based incentives was based on quoted market prices for the period during which the share-based incentives were outstanding.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\nAdjusted diluted EPS is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM) and has been calculated using profit from continuing operations for the purpose of basic EPS, adjusted for total adjusting items and the tax effect of those items.\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nProfit for the year\n13.8\n5.5\nExceptional items\n3.6\n11.0\nShare-based payments\n1.4\n3.1\nTax effect\n(1.1)\n(2.3)\nTotal adjusted profit for the year\n17.7\n17.3\nNumber\nNumber\nTotal issued share capital for the purposes of adjusted diluted earnings per share\n327,737,158\n326,334,279\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (pence)\n5.4\n5.3\n11. Business combinations\nAcquisition of AHK Designs Ltd - May 2024\nOn 17 May 2024 Victorian Plumbing Ltd, a subsidiary, acquired the entire issued share capital of AHK Designs Ltd, trading as Victoria Plum (\"Victoria Plum\").\nVictoria Plum was acquired for initial consideration of \u00a322.5m, with \u00a30.3m repaid by the seller through the completion accounts adjustment.\n\u00a3m\nPurchase consideration:\nInitial cash paid\n22.5\nFinal working capital adjustment\n(0.3)\nTotal consideration\n22.2\nThe provisional fair value of assets and liabilities recognised as a result of this acquisition are as follows:\n\u00a3m\nTangible fixed assets\n-\nIntangible fixed assets\n-\nInventory\n8.9\nCash\n3.1\nTrade and other receivables\n1.1\nTrade payables\n(3.2)\nOther taxation and NI\n(1.5)\nCorporation tax\n(0.3)\nOther payables\n(0.7)\nAccruals\n(2.3)\nContract liabilities\n(1.7)\nNet identifiable assets acquired\n3.4\nGoodwill\n18.8\nNet assets acquired\n22.2\n12.

The goodwill represents the removal of a nuisance factor, being the competing brand with a similar name. This goodwill is expected to generate benefit for the existing Victorian Plumbing Group and has therefore been allocated to the Victorian Plumbing Group cash generating unit (\"CGU\").\nThis balance has been reviewed for impairment on a value in use basis by performing a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") exercise for the CGU. The key assumptions within the DCF include expected revenue growth (market share and average order value) and costs in accordance with the three-year Board approved budget, followed by a long-term growth rate of 2.0% into perpetuity and a pre-tax discount rate of 14.0%. Significant headroom was retained over the carrying value of the goodwill. The value in use calculation was not sensitive to reasonably possible changes in these key assumptions and the carrying value of goodwill is considered recoverable.\n13.

An addition of \u00a34.3m has been recognised as a right-of-use asset, in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, representing the discounted future cashflows under the contract. Furthermore, the Group renewed leases on three of its properties that had expired; these represent modifications under IFRS 16. The right-of-use asset was increased by \u00a31.5m to reflect the value of the asset after the modification and the corresponding lease liability increased by \u00a31.5m. The Group had total cash outflows for leases of \u00a34.0m (2024: \u00a33.8m).\nLease liabilities as at 30 September were classified as follows:\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nNon-current\n47.5\n43.0\nCurrent\n3.6\n3.1\nTotal\n51.1\n46.1\n19.

On 18 December 2024, the RCF was secured for \u00a330m, with a termination date of 17 December 2027. The facility is secured by a debenture dated 7 June 2021. Interest on the RCF is charged at SONIA plus a margin based on the consolidated leverage of the Group. A commitment fee of 35% of the margin applicable to the RCF is payable quarterly in arrears on unutilised amounts of the RCF. There is no requirement to settle all, or part, of the debt earlier than the termination date.\nUnamortised debt issue costs of \u00a30.3m (2024: \u00a30.1m) are included in prepayments.\n20.

Share-based payments\nThe Group operates four share plans being the Share Incentive Plan (\"SIP\"), a Deferred Bonus Plan (\"DBP\"), a Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\") and a Sharesave scheme (\"SAYE\"). In addition, following Admission to AIM in June 2021, the Group awarded shares to the Chair and certain members of Key Management in the form of Restricted Share Awards (\"RSAs\") which had restrictions placed against them that bring the awards into the scope of IFRS 2.\nAll share-based incentives carry a service condition. Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service received. The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives granted. Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes pricing models have been used where appropriate to calculate the fair value of share-based incentives with market conditions.\nSensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the fair value of the share-based incentives. There are no changes to key assumptions that are considered by the Directors to be reasonably possible, which give rise to a material difference in the fair value of the share-based incentives.\nThe total charge in the year was \u00a31.4m (2024: \u00a33.1m) with a Company charge of \u00a30.2m (2024: \u00a30.8m). This included associated NI at 15.0% (2024: 13.8%), which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the awards are exercised, and apprenticeship levy at 0.5%, based on the share price at the reporting date.\n2025\n\u00a3m\n2024\n\u00a3m\nDeferred Bonus Plans\n0.5\n0.8\nLong Term Incentive Plans\n-\n0.3\nSharesave Schemes\n0.1\n0.1\nRestricted Share Awards\n0.7\n1.3\nShare Incentive Plan\n-\n0.2\nTotal IFRS 2 charge\n1.3\n2.7\nNI and apprenticeship levy on applicable schemes\n0.1\n0.4\nTotal charge\n1.4\n3.1\nDeferred Bonus Plan\nThe Group operates a DBP for the ELT and certain key employees. It is both a cash bonus plan and a discretionary employee share plan under which a proportion of a participant's annual bonus is deferred into an award over shares. Awards under the plan are contingent on the satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to financial and operational objectives. An option will be granted following determination of performance against targets, with 40% of the award vesting immediately, 30% after one year and 30% after two years. Awards are potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment.\nDuring the year the Group made awards over 1,914,027 ordinary shares under the DBP scheme, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria to be determined by the Remuneration Committee. The fair value of the award was determined to be \u00a31.12, being the average market value of a share on 30 September 2024 and 30 November 2024.\n2025\nNumber\n2024\nNumber\nOutstanding at 1 October\n4,294,058\n4,660,836\nGranted\n1,914,027\n2,998,636\nForfeited\n(2,109,735)\n(2,375,186)\nVested\n(708,561)\n(990,228)\nOutstanding at 30 September\n3,389,789\n4,294,058\nThe total charge in the period, included in operating profit, in relation to these awards was \u00a30.5m (2024: \u00a30.8m). The Company charge for the period was \u00a3nil (2024: \u00a3nil).\nLong Term Incentive Plan\nThe Group operates a LTIP for the Executive Directors. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the satisfaction of the Group's financial and operational performance in the financial year of the award date.\nThe 2023 and 2024 LTIP awards are subject to performance conditions based on adjusted EPS (100% of award). Awards vest three years after grant subject to EPS performance conditions, with a two-year post-vesting holding period applying.\nThe 2025 LTIP awards are subject to performance conditions based on adjusted EPS (62.5% of award) and employment (37.5% of award). Awards vest 3 years after grant subject to EPS performance conditions, with a two-year post-vesting holding period applying.\nOn 1 February 2025, the Group awarded 1,206,264 nil cost options under the LTIP scheme. The fair value for the EPS element of the award at \u00a31.12 was based on the share price at the grant date.\n2025\nNumber\n2024\nNumber\nOutstanding at 1 October\n1,945,733\n1,118,497\nGranted\n1,206,264\n827,236\nLapsed\n(1,118,496)\n-\nOutstanding at 30 September\n2,033,501\n1,945,733\nThe total charge in the year, included in operating profit, in relation to these awards was \u00a3nil (2024: \u00a30.3m). The Company charge for the period was \u00a3nil (2024: \u00a30.3m).\nSharesave scheme\nThe Group operates a SAYE scheme for all employees under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years' time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. Options are granted and are linked to a savings contract with a term of three years. These funds are used to fund the option exercise. No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options. The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the Sharesave plan are as follows:\nGrant date\nShare price at grant date\n\u00a3\nExercise price\n\u00a3\nExpected volatility\n%\nOption life\nyears\nRisk-free rate\n%\nDividend yield\n%\nNon-vesting condition\n%\nFair value per option\n30/03/2023\n0.79\n0.68\n69\n3.17\n3.52\n1.39\n0\n0.40\n30/03/2024\n0.79\n0.67\n59\n3.17\n3.92\n1.77\n0\n0.36\n16/06/2025\n0.78\n0.66\n43\n3.12\n3.79\n2.28\n0\n0.27\nExpected volatility is estimated by considering the historical 3.12 year volatility of the FTSE AIM retailers.\n2025\nNumber of share options\n2024\nNumber of share options\nOutstanding at 1 October\n596,481\n533,973\nGranted\n409,327\n194,042\nForfeited\n(94,845)\n(131,534)\nExercised\n(237,253)\n-\nOutstanding at 30 September\n673,710\n596,481\nExercisable at 30 September\n25,889\n-\nThe total charge in the year, included in operating profit, in relation to these awards was \u00a30.1m (2024: \u00a30.1m). The Company charge for the period was \u00a3nil (2024: \u00a3nil).\nRestricted Share Awards\nThe Chair and certain members of Key Management have been granted RSAs. The RSAs do not have a performance condition attached to them but the extent to which they vest depends on a service condition being satisfied. The restricted shares are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the vesting date, unless under exceptional circumstances.\nGrant date\nShare price at grant date\n\u00a3\nEmployee contribution per share\nVesting period (years)\nRisk-free rate\n%\nDividend yield\n%\nNon-vesting condition\n%\nFair value per restricted share\n22/06/2021\n2.62\n\u00a30.001\n5.0\n-\n-\n-\n2.62\nThe number of restricted shares outstanding at 30 September 2025 was as follows:\n2025Number\n2024\nNumber\nOutstanding at 1 October\n1,508,462\n2,276,004\nVested\n(851,173)\n(767,543)\nOutstanding and unvested at 30 September\n657,289\n1,508,462\nThe market value per ordinary share for restricted shares that vested in the year was \u00a30.73.

The Company charge for the year was \u00a30.2m (2024: \u00a30.5m).\nShare Incentive Plan\nThe Group operates a SIP scheme that was made available to all eligible employees following Admission to AIM in June 2021. On 27 July 2021, all eligible employees were awarded free shares valued at \u00a33,600 each based on the closing share price on 26 July 2021 of \u00a32.67. A total of 635,504 shares were awarded under the scheme, subject to a three-year service period (the vesting period).\nOn 27 July 2024, the third anniversary of the award, the shares vested for those employees that remained in employment on that date.\nThe SIP awards have been valued using the Black-Scholes model and the resulting share-based payments charge spread evenly over the vesting period. The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the vesting period. No performance criteria are applied to the vesting of SIP shares. Fair value at the grant date was measured to be \u00a32.67.\n2025\nnumber\n2024\nnumber\nOutstanding at 1 October\n127,774\n347,037\nSale / transfers out\n(25,359)\n(178,504)\nDividend shares transferred in\n-\n3,725\nForfeited\n(1,348)\n(44,484)\nOutstanding at 30 September\n101,067\n127,774\nThe total charge in the year, included in operating profit, in relation to these awards was \u00a3nil (2024: \u00a30.2m).

Our performance reflects continued market share gains, underpinned by the strength of our product range and availability.\nCustomer demand for Victorian Plumbing (excluding MFI) remained robust, with FY25 order volumes growing by 6% and a record 1,080,000 orders delivered in the year (FY24: 1,022,000).\nThere was little variation in average order value, which stood at \u00a3287 (FY24: \u00a3289).\nStrategic initiatives continued to deliver strong results, driven by our warehouse transformation, improved delivery speeds, and the introduction of free tile samples, with notable contributions from:\n\u00b7\nTrade revenue, which grew c.10% to c.\u00a374m (FY24: \u00a367m), now contributing c.24% of Group revenue (FY24: 23%)\n\u00b7\nTiles & d\u00e9cor revenue, which surged c.40% to c.\u00a317m (FY24: \u00a312m), increasing to c.5% of Group revenue (FY24: 4%)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by c.17% to c.\u00a331.8m (FY24: \u00a327.2m), in line with the top end of market expectations, driven by revenue growth and improved marketing efficiency. Adjusted PBT is also in line with the top end of market expectations at c.\u00a321.8m (FY24: \u00a323.1m), whilst cash conversion remains strong.\nMFI Update\nWe began taking orders via\nmfi.co.uk\nduring the summer, following a soft launch of the reimagined brand in July. The response from customers has been very encouraging to date and we continue to build the product range ahead of its full launch in H1 2026. The Group's investment into MFI remains disciplined and in line with the guidance given at the interim results on 14 May 2025.\nNotice of Preliminary Results\nPreliminary results for FY25 will be published on\n3\nDecember 2025.\nMark Radcliffe, CEO of Victorian Plumbing, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report another solid financial and operational performance following an exciting twelve months for the Group. Our own brand proposition and availability of a wide range of high-quality bathroom products and accessories continue to resonate with our customers.\n\"Our new state of the art distribution centre continues to enable us to fulfil orders more efficiently and support our ambition to grow both our trade and expansion categories. We have also continued our strategic investment in the Victorian Plumbing brand and were pleased to soft launch the MFI brand in July. The feedback from customers has been positive and we look forward to growing the proposition and launching a broader range of products in H1 2026.\"\n1\nBarclays UK Consumer Spend Report\n-ENDS-\nFor further information, please contact:\nVictorian Plumbing Group plc\nMark Radcliffe, Chief Executive Officer\nDaniel Barton, Chief Financial Officer\nvia FTI Consulting\n+44 20 3727 1000\nFTI Consulting (Financial PR)\nAlex Beagley, Harriet Jackson, Amy Goldup, Lia Bevan\n+44 20 3727 1000\nVictorianPlumbing@fticonsulting.com\nHoulihan Lokey UK Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nSam Fuller, Tim Richardson\n+44 20 7839 3355\nBarclays Bank PLC (Joint Broker)\nNicola Tennent, Stuart Muress\n+44 20 7623 2323\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Joint Broker)\nBobbie Hilliam, Elizabeth Halley-Stott\n+44 20 7597 5970\nAbout Victorian Plumbing Group\nVictorian Plumbing is the UK's leading bathroom retailer, offering an unrivalled high-quality product range and excellent stock availability to B2C and trade customers.\nVictorian Plumbing offers its customers a one-stop shop solution for the entire bathroom with own and third party brands across a wide spectrum of price points.
