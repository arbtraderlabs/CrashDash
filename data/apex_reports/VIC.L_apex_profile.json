Our performance reflects continued market share gains, underpinned by the strength of our product range and availability.\nCustomer demand for Victorian Plumbing (excluding MFI) remained robust, with FY25 order volumes growing by 6% and a record 1,080,000 orders delivered in the year (FY24: 1,022,000).\nThere was little variation in average order value, which stood at \u00a3287 (FY24: \u00a3289).\nStrategic initiatives continued to deliver strong results, driven by our warehouse transformation, improved delivery speeds, and the introduction of free tile samples, with notable contributions from:\n\u00b7\nTrade revenue, which grew c.10% to c.\u00a374m (FY24: \u00a367m), now contributing c.24% of Group revenue (FY24: 23%)\n\u00b7\nTiles & d\u00e9cor revenue, which surged c.40% to c.\u00a317m (FY24: \u00a312m), increasing to c.5% of Group revenue (FY24: 4%)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by c.17% to c.\u00a331.8m (FY24: \u00a327.2m), in line with the top end of market expectations, driven by revenue growth and improved marketing efficiency. Adjusted PBT is also in line with the top end of market expectations at c.\u00a321.8m (FY24: \u00a323.1m), whilst cash conversion remains strong.\nMFI Update\nWe began taking orders via\nmfi.co.uk\nduring the summer, following a soft launch of the reimagined brand in July. The response from customers has been very encouraging to date and we continue to build the product range ahead of its full launch in H1 2026. The Group's investment into MFI remains disciplined and in line with the guidance given at the interim results on 14 May 2025.\nNotice of Preliminary Results\nPreliminary results for FY25 will be published on\n3\nDecember 2025.\nMark Radcliffe, CEO of Victorian Plumbing, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report another solid financial and operational performance following an exciting twelve months for the Group. Our own brand proposition and availability of a wide range of high-quality bathroom products and accessories continue to resonate with our customers.\n\"Our new state of the art distribution centre continues to enable us to fulfil orders more efficiently and support our ambition to grow both our trade and expansion categories. We have also continued our strategic investment in the Victorian Plumbing brand and were pleased to soft launch the MFI brand in July. The feedback from customers has been positive and we look forward to growing the proposition and launching a broader range of products in H1 2026.\"\n1\nBarclays UK Consumer Spend Report\n-ENDS-\nFor further information, please contact:\nVictorian Plumbing Group plc\nMark Radcliffe, Chief Executive Officer\nDaniel Barton, Chief Financial Officer\nvia FTI Consulting\n+44 20 3727 1000\nFTI Consulting (Financial PR)\nAlex Beagley, Harriet Jackson, Amy Goldup, Lia Bevan\n+44 20 3727 1000\nVictorianPlumbing@fticonsulting.com\nHoulihan Lokey UK Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nSam Fuller, Tim Richardson\n+44 20 7839 3355\nBarclays Bank PLC (Joint Broker)\nNicola Tennent, Stuart Muress\n+44 20 7623 2323\nCanaccord Genuity Limited (Joint Broker)\nBobbie Hilliam, Elizabeth Halley-Stott\n+44 20 7597 5970\nAbout Victorian Plumbing Group\nVictorian Plumbing is the UK's leading bathroom retailer, offering an unrivalled high-quality product range and excellent stock availability to B2C and trade customers.\nVictorian Plumbing offers its customers a one-stop shop solution for the entire bathroom with own and third party brands across a wide spectrum of price points.
