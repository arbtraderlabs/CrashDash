In particular, we are excited about the significant opportunities in the data centre construction market through our strategic partnership with Centslink. We are working diligently to secure a project through leveraging our network and the strong track record of Centslink, and we hope to update shareholders on our progress in due course.\"\nOperational Review\nDuring the six months to 30 April 2025, the Group continued to seek to source IT services projects, primarily through its Alcodes International subsidiary in Hong Kong and with a focus on providing IT consultancy to supply digital infrastructure and platforms. While the Group did not secure or deliver any projects during the period, it is in advanced negotiations regarding a number of projects and expects to sign at least one contract by the end of the year.\nPost period end, as announced on 6 May 2025, the Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Centslink, a technology-driven enterprise specialising in the design, construction and delivery of data centre infrastructure and management, for the purpose of pursuing data centre construction projects. The Group has commenced pursuing opportunities, in Southeast Asia and internationally, and has already signed a Letter of Intent with a renewable energy provider based in the US with a view to constructing a data centre that would be powered by renewable electricity. While there can be no guarantee that this activity will result in the award of a contract or the generation of revenue, the Group's management believes that data centre construction represents a potentially sizable opportunity for the Group. This is due to the growing need for new data centres in regions such as Southeast Asia as well as the requirement to convert existing low-tier data centres to high-tier data centres to cater for the ever-increasing demand for power with minimal downtime.\nT\nhe Board continues to closely monitor the cash position and\u00a0is keeping all its strategic options open in assessing how best to deliver shareholder value. The Board is grateful for the ongoing support of its major shareholders.\nFinancial Review*\nThe Group did not generate revenue during the six months ended 30 April 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a3153k).\nAdministrative expenses were slightly reduced to \u00a3215k (H1 2024: \u00a3245k) as the Group continued to implement cost reduction measures. The operating loss was \u00a3218k (H1 2024: \u00a3175k loss).\nNet finance costs were maintained at \u00a315k (H1 2024: \u00a315k).\nLoss before tax for the period was \u00a3233k (H1 2024: \u00a3189k loss).\nThe Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k at 30 April 2025 (31 October 2024: \u00a3\n30k\n). During the period, the Group entered non-interest bearing loan agreements with Li Chun Chung, an Executive Director of the Company, amounting to c. \u00a3295k, of which \u00a3270k was drawn down, and a further loan agreement post period of \u00a390k, which was fully drawn.\nThe Group continued to have the support of its major shareholders, with\nthe expiration date of the Group's convertible loan note facility being extended to 31 January 2027 during the period. All other details of the convertible loan note facility remained unchanged (see note 10 to the financial statements).\n* The comparative figures for H1 2024 are for continuing operations only (see the financial statements for further detail on discontinued operations)\nGoing Concern\nThe Group incurred losses of \u00a3233k during the period and cash outflows from operating activities of \u00a3274k. As at 30 April 2025, the Group had net current liabilities of \u00a3362k and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k. The Group's cash position was approximately \u00a377k as at 28 July 2025, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this report.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Directors take into account all available information for the foreseeable future, in particular for the 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. This information includes management prepared cash flows forecasts for the Group.\nThe Directors have assessed that to meet its forecasted cash requirements, the Group is dependent on cash generated from the new revenue contracts, continued support from its loan holders and/or obtaining further funding in the form of debt/equity. As discussed in Note 11, post period, the Company raised \u00a390k from an Executive Director. The significant shareholders of the Company have also indicated their intention to provide further support. The Directors are confident that the actions required to maintain the going concern position of the Group can be achieved as successfully demonstrated in the past. As a result, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nThe uncertainty around management estimation of winning new revenue contracts and/or obtaining additional funding gives rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Directors consider the Group to be a going concern but have identified a material uncertainty in this regard.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe principal\u00a0risks and uncertainties\u00a0that could have a material impact on the Group's performance over the remaining half of the financial year have not changed from those that are set out in detail in the Group's annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 October 2024.\n\u00b7\nFinancial - The key financial risk is that of funding the continued development of the business with the current cash reserves whilst protecting shareholder value.\n\u00b7\nCompetition - The success of the Group is dependent on its ability to secure and deliver IT consultancy projects. The key risk to these activities is competition from other IT service providers, which may prevent the Group from winning business and/or result in pricing pressure.\n\u00b7\nSuppliers - Some of the Group's technical infrastructure and software is sourced from third-party suppliers and partners. The removal from the market of one or more of these third-party suppliers or interruption in supply could quickly and adversely affect the Group's operations and result in the loss of revenue or additional expenditure.\n\u00b7\nPeople - The Group operates in very competitive markets and the skills that its employees possess are attractive to other employers. Not having the right people and skills could negatively impact the Group's ability to service its customers and grow the business.\nResponsibilities Statement\nThe Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting;\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group;\n\u00b7\nthe Interim Report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the interim financial information, and a fair description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial information includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R, being the information required on related party transactions.\nA list of current directors is maintained on the Company's website:\nhttps://aiqhub.com/\nThe interim financial statements were approved by the

statements\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\nAIQ Limited (\"the Company\") was incorporated and registered in The Cayman Islands as a private company limited by shares on 11 October 2017 under the Companies Law (as revised) of The Cayman Islands, with the name AIQ Limited, and registered number 327983.\nThe Company's registered office is located at 5th Floor Genesis Building, Genesis Close, PO Box 446, Cayman Islands, KY1-1106.\nThe Company's ordinary shares are listed on the Equity Shares (Transition) category of the Official List and trade on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries (the \"Group\").\n2. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\nThe principal activities of the Group currently comprise the delivery of information technology (IT) solutions for clients through the provision of IT consultancy.\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\na) Basis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and International Accounting Standard 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" (IAS 34). Other than as noted below, the accounting policies applied by the Group in these condensed interim financial statements are the same as those set out in the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2024. These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and cover the six-month period to 30 April 2025.\nThese condensed financial statements do not include all of the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2024.\nThe condensed interim financial statements are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the auditors and were approved by the Board of Directors on 30 July 2025.\nThe financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), which is the presentational currency of the Company.\nA summary of the principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below.\nb) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to the end of the reporting period. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an investee if the Group has power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability to use its power to affect those variable returns.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity. Inter-company balances and transactions between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full. The financial information of subsidiaries is included in the Group's financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\nDuring the year to 31 October 2023, the Group discontinued its operation in Malaysia as part of its consolidation strategy to save cost and focus on operations in Hong Kong and therefore the comparatives in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income pertaining to discontinued operations were restated in line with IFRS 5\n- Non-current assets held for sale sand discontinued operations.\nc) Going concern\nThe Group incurred losses of \u00a3233k during the period and cash outflows from operating activities of \u00a3274k. As at 30 April 2025, the Group had net current liabilities of \u00a3362k and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k. The Group's cash position was approximately \u00a377k as at 28 July 2025, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this report.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Directors take into account all available information for the foreseeable future, in particular for the 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. This information includes management prepared cash flows forecasts for the Group.\nThe Directors have assessed that to meet its forecasted cash requirements, the Group is dependent on cash generated from the new revenue contracts, continued support from its loan holders and/or obtaining further funding in the form of debt/equity.\nAs discussed in Note 11, post period, the Company raised \u00a390k from an Executive Director.\nThe significant shareholders of the Company have also indicated their intention to provide further support. The Directors are confident that the actions required to maintain the going concern position of the Group can be achieved as successfully demonstrated in the past. As a result, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nThe uncertainty around management estimation of winning new revenue contracts and/or obtaining additional funding gives rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nTherefore, the Directors consider the Group to be a going concern but have identified a material uncertainty in this regard.\n4.

SEGMENT REPORTING\nIFRS 8 defines operating segments as those activities of an entity about which separate financial information is available and which are evaluated by the Board of Directors to assess performance and determine the allocation of resources. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that under IFRS 8 the Group has only one operating segment,\ninformation technology product and services\n. The Board of Directors assesses the performance of the operating segment using financial information that is measured and presented in a manner consistent with that in the Financial Statements.\nAll revenues were derived from Asia.\n7. LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share information for its ordinary shares. Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the reporting period. Diluted loss per share is determined by adjusting the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares\n.\nThere is no difference between the basic and diluted loss per share, as the Company's warrants and loan notes are anti-dilutive in nature and therefore the diluted loss per share has not been presented.\nSix months ended 30 April 2025\nSix months ended 30 April 2024\nYear ended 31 October 2024\nLoss attributable to ordinary shareholders (\u00a3)\n(232,824)\n(189,375)\n(269,417\nContinuing operations\n(232,824)\n(189,375)\n(267,656)\nDiscontinued operations\n-\n-\n(1,761)\nBasic - Weighted average number of shares\n64,760,721\n64,760,721\n64,760,721\nBasic loss per share (expressed as \u00a3 per share)\nfrom continuing operations\n(0.004)\n(0.003)\n(0.004)\nfrom discontinued operations\n-\n-\n(0.00003)\n8.

SHARE WARRANT RESERVE\nOn 3 October 2022, the Company granted 300,000 warrants to Guild Financial Advisory (\"GFA\"), the Company's corporate adviser, exercisable at a price of \u00a30.01 for a period of up to ten years. The warrants were granted in return in part for their corporate financial services carried out for a period of 12 months whereby it was agreed that GFA would provide services for an amount of \u00a324,000 with \u00a312,000 being settled in cash and the balance of \u00a312,000 represented by the issue of the warrants.\nAs a result of this, the fair value of the warrants was deemed to be \u00a312,000 spread evenly over the 12-month period of the contract, \u00a31,000 was expensed in October 2022 and \u00a311,000 was expensed during the year to October 2023 and \u00a312,000 was taken to a warrant reserve.\n10. CONVERTIBLE LOAN NOTES\nOn 24 January 2022, the Company entered into an unsecured convertible loan note agreement (the \"Convertible Loan Note Facility\") for a total subscription of \u00a3500,000 (the \"Loan Notes\").\nOn 31 July 2023, the Company came to an agreement to amend certain terms of the convertible loan note instrument\u00a0whereby the expiration date of the convertible loan notes was extended by a period of 12 months from 24 January 2024 to 24 January 2025 (the \"Expiration Date\") and on 24 February it was subsequently agreed to extend the expiration date to 31 January 2027. All other details of the Convertible Loan Note Facility remained unchanged, namely that the loan notes can be repaid, in part or in full, by the Company on 31 December in any year prior to the Expiration Date by giving not less than 14 days' written notice to the noteholders. All outstanding Loan Notes attract interest at a rate of 5% per annum from the date of issue (25 January 2022) to the date of repayment or conversion and is payable on the anniversary of the issue of the Loan Notes.\nThe Loan Notes shall be convertible into new ordinary shares of the Company at the lesser of 11 pence per ordinary share or the volume weighted average price of the Company's ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange in the seven-day period prior to the date on which the Loan Note is converted into ordinary shares. The Loan Notes shall be convertible, in part or in full, at any time from the date of issue until the Expiration Date by the noteholder giving to the Company at least one week's written notice.\n11. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\nAs announced on 18 July 2025, post period end the Company entered into an agreement with Li Chun Chung, an Executive Director of the Company, for a further interest-free, unsecured loan of \u00a390,000, which is repayable on demand.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In particular, we are excited about the significant opportunities in the data centre construction market through our strategic partnership with Centslink. We are working diligently to secure a project through leveraging our network and the strong track record of Centslink, and we hope to update shareholders on our progress in due course.\"\nOperational Review\nDuring the six months to 30 April 2025, the Group continued to seek to source IT services projects, primarily through its Alcodes International subsidiary in Hong Kong and with a focus on providing IT consultancy to supply digital infrastructure and platforms. While the Group did not secure or deliver any projects during the period, it is in advanced negotiations regarding a number of projects and expects to sign at least one contract by the end of the year.\nPost period end, as announced on 6 May 2025, the Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Centslink, a technology-driven enterprise specialising in the design, construction and delivery of data centre infrastructure and management, for the purpose of pursuing data centre construction projects. The Group has commenced pursuing opportunities, in Southeast Asia and internationally, and has already signed a Letter of Intent with a renewable energy provider based in the US with a view to constructing a data centre that would be powered by renewable electricity. While there can be no guarantee that this activity will result in the award of a contract or the generation of revenue, the Group's management believes that data centre construction represents a potentially sizable opportunity for the Group. This is due to the growing need for new data centres in regions such as Southeast Asia as well as the requirement to convert existing low-tier data centres to high-tier data centres to cater for the ever-increasing demand for power with minimal downtime.\nT\nhe Board continues to closely monitor the cash position and\u00a0is keeping all its strategic options open in assessing how best to deliver shareholder value. The Board is grateful for the ongoing support of its major shareholders.\nFinancial Review*\nThe Group did not generate revenue during the six months ended 30 April 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a3153k).\nAdministrative expenses were slightly reduced to \u00a3215k (H1 2024: \u00a3245k) as the Group continued to implement cost reduction measures. The operating loss was \u00a3218k (H1 2024: \u00a3175k loss).\nNet finance costs were maintained at \u00a315k (H1 2024: \u00a315k).\nLoss before tax for the period was \u00a3233k (H1 2024: \u00a3189k loss).\nThe Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k at 30 April 2025 (31 October 2024: \u00a3\n30k\n). During the period, the Group entered non-interest bearing loan agreements with Li Chun Chung, an Executive Director of the Company, amounting to c. \u00a3295k, of which \u00a3270k was drawn down, and a further loan agreement post period of \u00a390k, which was fully drawn.\nThe Group continued to have the support of its major shareholders, with\nthe expiration date of the Group's convertible loan note facility being extended to 31 January 2027 during the period. All other details of the convertible loan note facility remained unchanged (see note 10 to the financial statements).\n* The comparative figures for H1 2024 are for continuing operations only (see the financial statements for further detail on discontinued operations)\nGoing Concern\nThe Group incurred losses of \u00a3233k during the period and cash outflows from operating activities of \u00a3274k. As at 30 April 2025, the Group had net current liabilities of \u00a3362k and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k. The Group's cash position was approximately \u00a377k as at 28 July 2025, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this report.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Directors take into account all available information for the foreseeable future, in particular for the 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. This information includes management prepared cash flows forecasts for the Group.\nThe Directors have assessed that to meet its forecasted cash requirements, the Group is dependent on cash generated from the new revenue contracts, continued support from its loan holders and/or obtaining further funding in the form of debt/equity.

This was compounded by the difficult economic conditions experienced globally. Accordingly, we decided to shift our strategic focus to sourcing IT services in alternative sectors. While we experienced some interest in our IT consultancy, relatively fewer projects were won due to the longer sales cycle of these contracts. Consequently, the level of revenue associated with these projects was low, albeit we generated higher revenue than in the previous year thanks to the gaming app project that we won in FY 2023 and completed in the year under review. Importantly, we continued to maintain tight cost control and further reduced our overall administrative expenditure by over 20% compared with the previous year.\nToday, our focus is on providing IT consultancy to supply digital infrastructure and platforms. In particular, we are targeting the Asian, Australasian and Middle Eastern markets to leverage the relationships we have with established partners.\nWhile we are hopeful of securing contracts in this area - and are currently having exploratory discussions regarding a potential data centre project - it is very difficult to forecast with any certainty in the current climate.\nAccordingly, the Board continues to closely monitor the cash position and\nis keeping all its strategic options open in assessing how best to deliver shareholder value.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to\nthank all of our shareholders for their continued support and we hope to be able to provide an update on progress in due course.\nHarry Chathli\nNon-Executive Chairman\nOperational Review\nDuring the year to 31 October 2024, AIQ completed the delivery of a project to\ndevelop a gaming application. The Group assisted the customer with the concept for the video game app and its technical development.\nIn this project, the Group performed the role of project manager and subcontracted the technical delivery (such that the net benefit to the Group is the margin earned on the contract).\nIn addition, the Group undertook a consulting project whereby it advised a customer in\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0on the feasibility of operating an e-commerce platform, based on a mass affiliate programme, focusing on the food & beverage industry. The Group delivered this project directly (as opposed to performing the role of project manager), leveraging its previous experience with its OctaPLUS platform, and, accordingly, it carried a higher gross margin than the other projects undertaken.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue for the year to 31 October 2024 was \u00a3304,233 for continuing operations, compared with \u00a3207,209 for the previous year. The revenue was primarily based on\na project taken on to develop a gaming application representing 87% of the total revenue for the year. The Group assisted the customer with the concept for the video game app and its technical development.\nThe Group recognised a gross profit of \u00a3230,589 compared with \u00a3133,509 for the previous year from continuing",

Accordingly, the Group has shifted its focus to sourcing IT services projects in alternative sectors.\nDuring the six months to 30 April 2024, the Group completed the delivery of a\nproject, which commenced in the previous year, to develop a gaming application. The Group assisted the customer with the concept for the video game app and its technical development.\nIn this project, the Group performed the role of project manager and subcontracted the technical delivery (such that the net benefit to the Group is the margin earned on the contract).\nPost period, the Group undertook a consulting project, for which it received HK$200k, whereby it advised a customer in Hong Kong on the feasibility of operating an e-commerce platform, based on a mass affiliate programme, focusing on the food & beverage industry. If the customer decides to launch the platform, the Group expects to be appointed to assist with building the platform engine. The Group is delivering this project directly (as opposed to performing the role of project manager), leveraging its previous experience with its OctaPLUS platform, and, accordingly, it carries a higher gross margin than the other projects recently undertaken.\nWith revenue generation remaining subdued\n, the Board continues to closely monitor the cash position and\u00a0is keeping all its strategic options open in assessing how best to deliver shareholder value. The Board is grateful for the ongoing support of its major shareholders.\nFinancial Review*\nRevenue for the six months ended 30 April 2024 was \u00a3153k (H1 2023: \u00a373k). The revenue was generated from the delivery of a project to develop a gaming application.\nThe Group recognised a gross profit of \u00a379k (H1 2023: \u00a371k).\nAdministrative expenses were slightly reduced to \u00a3245k (H1 2023: \u00a3278k) as the Group continued to implement cost reduction measures. There was a net loss on foreign exchange of \u00a38k (H1 2023: \u00a3115k loss) due to the continued weakness of the Pound against the Hong Kong Dollar. Accordingly, operating loss was \u00a3175k (H1 2023: \u00a3323k loss).\nNet finance costs were \u00a315k compared with \u00a316k for the first half of the previous year.\nLoss before tax for the period was \u00a3189k (H1 2023: \u00a3339k loss).\nThe Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a330k at 30 April 2024 (31 October 2023: \u00a3\n135k\n). Post period, as announced on 5 July 2024, the Group entered a non-interest bearing loan agreement with Li Chun Chung, an Executive Director of the Company, to raise US$100k (see Note 11 to the financial statements). As at 26 July 2024, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a372k.\n* The comparative figures for H1 2023 are for continuing operations only (see the financial statements for further detail on discontinued operations)\nGoing Concern\nThe Group incurred losses of \u00a3189k during the period and cash outflows from operating activities of \u00a394k. As at 30 April 2024, the Group had net current liabilities of \u00a3160k and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a330k. The Group's cash position was approximately \u00a372k as at 26 July 2024, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this report.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Directors take into account all available information for the foreseeable future, in particular for the 12 mon",

While we were awarded two new contracts during the year, the level of revenue associated with these projects was low. Accordingly, to further reduce our expenditure, we resolved to consolidate our operations in Malaysia with those in Hong Kong. We vacated our premises during the year and formally closed our Malaysian subsidiary at year end.\nWe are currently completing a contract\nto develop a gaming application, and the customer has indicated that we will receive follow-on work for a further phase of development. This was the first project that we have undertaken in game development, and we are seeking to leverage this experience by identifying other prospective customers to whom we can provide this service. While we are hopeful of securing further contracts in this area, it is very difficult to forecast with any certainty in the current climate.\nAccordingly, the Board continues to closely monitor the cash position and\nis keeping all its strategic options open should the markets not turn favourable in the near-term.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to\nthank all of our shareholders for their continued support and we hope to be able to provide an update on progress in due course.\nHarry Chathli\nNon-Executive Chairman\nOperational Review\nDuring the year to 31 October 2023, AIQ completed the delivery of a contract\nto supply an NFT platform. It has been built to enable art schools and education centres in\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0assist their students in publishing NFTs on a blockchain platform.\nThe Group delivered a feasibility study into building a virtual data centre on three different non-cryptocurrency public blockchains, in accordance with the customer's requirements.\nIt also commenced a project, which has continued into the current year, to develop a gaming application. The Group assisted the customer with the concept for the video game app and its technical development.\nIn each of these projects, the Group performed the role of project manager and subcontracted the technical delivery (such that the net benefit to the Group is the margin earned on the contract).\nDuring the year, the Board resolved to not renew the lease on its Malaysian office, which was due to expire in July 2023, and formally closed its Malaysian subsidiary. The Group's business has been primarily conducted from\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0since the establishment of Alcodes International in\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0and the divestment of the Group's\u00a0Malaysia-based e-commerce business.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue for the year to 31 October 2023 was \u00a3207,209 for continuing operations, compared with \u00a3496,296 for the previous year. The revenue was primarily based\non the delivery of the feasibility study into building a virtual data centre and from gaming app development. As discussed in the Chairman's Statement above, the reduction in revenue reflects the challenges the Group faced in securing new contracts owing to the difficult economic environment.",

We completed the delivery of our project from last year and also commenced a new contract in the first half that was completed in the second half.\n\"At the time of the full year results earlier this year, we noted that we were continuing to receive interest, but that the revenues would be second half weighted. We remain hopeful of signing a new substantive contract in the second half of this year, but we do not expect full revenue recognition from this contract in this fiscal year. Consequently, we anticipate revenues for the full year 2023 to be substantially below that of last year. We continue to maintain tight cost control and lower our expenditure levels. We have vacated our premises in Malaysia and are consolidating our operations in Malaysia with those in Hong Kong thereby reducing our cost level by \u00a3100k on an annualised basis. We are pleased that our supportive shareholders have extended the deadline for repayment of their loan by 12 months from its due date in 2024. Additionally, the Board is keeping all its strategic options open should the markets not turn favourable in the short- to mid-term.\n\"\nEnquiries\nAIQ Limited\nc/o +44 (0)20 4\n582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Chairman\nGuild Financial Advisory Limited (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0)\n7973839767\nRoss Andrews\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nClaire Norbury\nOperational Review\nDuring the six months to 30 April 2023, AIQ completed the delivery of a contract\nto supply an NFT platform. It has been built to enable art schools and education centres in Hong Kong assist their students in publishing NFTs on a blockchain platform. The Group performed the role of project manager and subcontracted the technical delivery (such that the net benefit to the Group is the margin earned on the contract).\nTowards the end of the period, the Group was awarded a contract, by a new customer, to set up a virtual data centre. As with the NFT marketplace, the Group's role is project manager. The Group has delivered the initial phase of the project as planned. This comprised a feasibility study into building the data centre on three different non-cryptocurrency public blockchains, in accordance with the customer's requirements. Based on the findings of the feasibility study, the customer has decided to reevaluate its plans to build a virtual data centre. Accordingly, while the Group expects to be awarded further work from this customer under new contracts in due course, for this initial project the Group will now receive approximately 35% of the contract value announced on 27 March 2023.\nDuring the period, the Board resolved to not renew the lease on its Malaysian office, which was due to expire in July 2023, and to formally close its Malaysian subsidiary, which is expected to occur by the end of the year. The Group's business has been primarily conducted from Hong Kong since the establishment of Alcodes International in Hong Kong and the divestment of the Group's Malaysia-based e-commerce business. Accordingly, the Group expects to recognise further cost savings of approximately \u00a3100k on an annualised basis by winding down its Malaysian operations.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue for the six months ended 30 April 2023 was \u00a373k (H1 2022: \u00a3361k). The revenue was primarily based\non delivery under the data centre contract with a small proportion contributed by the NFT platform contract\n.\nThe Group recognised a gross profit of \u00a371k (H1 2022: \u00a3115k), which reflects the lower revenues.\nAdministrative expenses were reduced to \u00a3286k (H1 2022: \u00a3392k) as the Group continued to implement cost reduction measures. However, this was offset by a net loss on foreign exchange of \u00a3121k (H1 2022: \u00a370k gain) due to the weakening of the Pound against the Malaysian Ringgit and Hong Kong Dollar. Accordingly, operating loss was \u00a3337k (H1 2022: \u00a3207k loss).\nN",

We had some success during 2022 in capitalising on the\nlack of IT solutions providers in Asia that specialise in the delivery of blockchain platforms, including forming partnerships with key solutions providers and completing a contract to project manage the supply of a decentralised finance exchange to a customer based in Australia.\n\"While there have been initial signs of progress during 2022 and subsequently, revenue generation remains low as the environment for NFT projects comes under pressure. We continue to receive interest and are hopeful of generating growth for the full year, but we expect this to be second-half weighted. Consequently, the Board continues to closely monitor the cash position and forecasts, and to contain expenditure levels.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to\nthank all of our shareholders for their continued support and we hope to be able to provide an update on progress with our strategy in due course.\"\nEnquiries\nAIQ Limited\nc/o +44 (0)20 4\n582 3500\nHarry Chathli, Chairman\nGuild Financial Advisory Limited (Financial Adviser)\n+44 (0)\n7973839767\nRoss Andrews\nGracechurch Group (Financial PR)\n+44 (0)20 4582 3500\nClaire Norbury\nOperational Review\nThe Group's largest project during the year was the delivery of a contract, which had been secured at the end of the previous year, to supply a DeFi DEX to a customer based in Australia. For this project, the Group performed the role of project manager and subcontracted the technical delivery (such that the net benefit to the Group is the margin earned on the contract). The majority of the project was delivered during the first half, with completion occurring in the second half of the year.\nAIQ took its first step into\nthe NFT marketplace with the award of a contract to supply an NFT platform designed to enable art schools and education centres in Hong Kong to assist their students in publishing NFTs on a blockchain platform. The Group commenced delivery during the year and completed it post period. As with the DeFi DEX, the Group performed the role of project manager herein as well. The platform is fully operational and the customer is expected to engage the Group to administer and maintain the portal for 12 months. The Group is also in discussions with the customer regarding expanding the coverage of the platform from its current focus on Hong Kong to other regions.\nThe Group also continued to secure and deliver ICT projects (not blockchain related) in its regular IT consultancy business in Hong Kong. However, this business only accounts for a small proportion of revenue and is not a focus of the Group's strategy.\nAn important focus for during the year was seeking to establish partnerships to enable the Group to expand its network and offer. This resulted in a number of collaborations that supported the delivery of the projects mentioned above as well as some exciting prospects for 2023. In particular, the Group is having positive discussions with potential partnerships that would expand its offer to customers wishing to build infrastructure for the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) Spartan Network. The BSN Spartan Network, which was beta launched in September 2022, is a public infrastructure network that provides non-cryptocurrency blockchain services and is based on data centre software, which is open source, free and anonymous for anyone to install. By removing cryptocurrencies, the BSN Spartan Network aims to make this infrastructure available to any IT system globally. While it is early days, the Group has received interest from several potential customers in this area.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue for the twelve months",

During the period, we focused on delivering the DeFi DEX project and seeking to win new business, which resulted in us securing a contract to supply an NFT platform for educational applications. However, it is still early days for the new strategy. The Board continues to closely monitor the progress of the Group and evaluate opportunities for generating value for shareholders.\"\nEnquiries\nAIQ Limited\nc/o +44 (0)20 7618 9100\nGraham Duncan, Chairman\nLuther Pendragon (Media Relations)\nClaire Norbury\n+44 (0)20 7618 9100\nOperational Review\nDuring the first half of the 2022 financial year, the Group focused on the delivery of a contract, secured at the end of the previous year, to supply a DeFi DEX to a customer based in Australia. For the project, the Group performs the role of project manager and subcontracts the technical delivery (such that the net benefit to the Group is the margin earned on the contract). The majority of the project was delivered during the first half, with completion occurring since period end.\nAlso during the period the Group was awarded a contract to supply an NFT platform designed to enable art schools and education centres in Hong Kong to assist their students in publishing NFTs and developing their creative talent under Web3 technology. The Group will oversee and manage the project, with the development of the marketplace being provided by Accubits Technologies Inc., a full-service software provider, and digiXnode Technology Ltd., which specialises in blockchain development. Work on the platform is underway and the beta version is expected to be ready for testing in the coming months.\nFinancial Review\nRevenue for the six months to 30 April 2022 was \u00a3361k compared with \u00a312k for the first half of the previous year. The revenue was predominantly based on the delivery of the DeFi DEX contract (\u00a3331k), with \u00a310k from the NFT contract and a \u00a319k contribution from IT projects in Hong Kong.\nThe Group recognised a gross profit of \u00a3115k compared with a gross loss of \u00a3197k for the first six months of the previous year. This was as a result of the higher revenue.\nAdministrative expenses were reduced to \u00a3392k (H1 2021: \u00a3573k) reflecting a reduction in personnel costs of \u00a343k, Directors' fees of \u00a328k, and consultancy and other overhead savings of \u00a3110k.\nIn Malaysia, the Group was able to sublet around half of its office space during the period, which has been substantially increased post period, thereby serving to further reduce the Group's outgoings.\nThe Group recognised a net gain on foreign exchange of \u00a370k compared with a net loss of \u00a3138k for the same period of the prior year.\nThe lower expenses combined with the higher revenue enabled a significant reduction in operating loss for the period to \u00a3207k (H1 2021: \u00a3908k loss).\nNet finance costs were \u00a35k compared with \u00a37k for the first half of the previous year.\nAs a result, loss before tax for the period was reduced to \u00a3202k (H1 2021: \u00a3915k loss) and the loss per share to 0.3 pence (H1 2021: 1.4 pence loss per share).\nDuring the period, as announced on 25 January 2022, the Group raised \u00a3500k from the issue of convertible loan notes.\nAt 30 April 2022, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a3852k (31 October 2021: \u00a3582k).\nOutlook\nIn the second half of the year, the Group has continued to deliver its IT consultancy projects and maintain tight control over costs. The Group expects revenue for the full year to be significantly higher than for the year to 31 October 2021 and anticipates a substantial reduction in net loss. However, the Group expects",

As stated previously, the Board undertook significant cost-cutting measures and a fundamental strategic review. Steps were taken to preserve cash while seeking to reposition the business by widening its focus beyond e-commerce. While it is early days, the Company has received interest in its IT solutions it can provide for blockchain technology and digital assets.\nAIQ is looking to capitalise on a lack of IT solutions providers specialising in delivery of blockchain platforms in Asia and to take advantage of the increasing popularity of decentralised finance and NFTs in the region. Strategically, the Company hopes to build the AIQ brand as a leading project manager and IT solutions provider in the Asia Pacific market.\nIt is proposed that following the successful award of a contract, announced on 4 October 2021, to project manage a decentralised finance platform, the focus of the Company will be to build on this and support the management team and enable them to develop within this fast-growing sector. The initial step in this process will be to forge partnerships with key solutions providers so as to enable the Company to provide a full service, one-stop solution to potential clients.\nFor the year ended 31 October 2021, the Company's unaudited revenues were \u00a360,000 (FY 2020: \u00a3154,000) and unaudited cash balances at 31 December 2021 were \u00a3540,000 (31 October 2021: \u00a3581,000). The Company's full year audited results are expected to be announced at the end of February 2022.\nTerms of the Loan Notes\nOn 24 January 2022, the Company entered into an unsecured convertible loan note agreement with the Noteholders for a total subscription of \u00a3500,000.\nThe Loan Notes have an expiration date of 24 January 2024 (\"Expiration Date\") and can be repaid, in part or in full, by the Company on 31 December in any year prior to the Expiration Date by giving not less than 14 days' written notice to the Noteholders. All outstanding Loan Notes attract interest at a rate of 5% per annum from the date of issue (24 January 2022) to the date of repayment or conversion.\nThe Loan Notes shall be convertible into new Ordinary Shares of the Company at the lesser of 11 pence per Ordinary Share or the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange in the seven-day period prior to the date on which the Loan Note is converted into Ordinary Shares. The Loan Notes shall be convertible, in part or in full, at any time from the date of issue until the Expiration Date by the Noteholder giving to the Company at least one week's written notice (the \"Conversion Notice\").\nIn the event of the Company receiving a Conversion Notice in circumstances where the Company would be required to publish a prospectus in relation to the application to trading of such Ordinary Shares, the Company shall have the sole right to reject such notice. In addition, a Noteholder shall not be permitted to issue a Conversion Notice if they are in possession of any unpublished price sensitive or inside information as such terms are defined in the UK Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Market Abuse Regulation (as in force in the United Kingdom).\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe Noteholders are deemed to be related parties by virtue of their combined shareholdings of 38.6% and Li Chun Chung being an Executive Director. Graham Duncan and Harry Chathli, being Independent Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Director of the Company respectively, consider that the terms of the\nLoan Notes are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nEnquiries\nAIQ Limited\nc/o +44 (0)20 7618 9100\nGraham Duncan, Chairman\nVSA Capital Limited (Financial Adviser & Broker)\n+44 (0)20 3005 5000\nAndrew Raca (Corporate Finance",

          "content": "AIQ Limited (LON: AIQ) is an acquisition shell \u2013 a SPAC in the American \u2013 listed in London. The share price, as reported, has just fallen 20% this morning. So, is AIQ a good share to be viewing as a trading opportunity? One approach is to consider what AIQ actually does. Which, as an acquisition shell, isn\u2019t very much. Future value depends largely to near exclusively on who they identify as a merger candidate. As we don\u2019t know anything about that it\u2019s difficult for us to trade it. Another view is that we can observe that AIQ bounces around a bit so we could just have a position and hope to time matters correctly, get on the right side of those bounces. That\u2019s risky and not exactly a directed strategy. We can also do one of those things which we should take note of in anything and everything we try to trade. Which is to check the liquidity of a share. AIQ is \u201coffbook\u201d trading. That\u2019s very close to the older \u201cmatched bargain\u201d idea. There is no marketmaker willing to trade with all comers. Rather, a seller must be matched up with an end user buyer and vice versa in each and every trade. This means that the AIQ shares are illiquid. We should all know that liquidity reduces spreads. The more people buying and selling the same thing then the smaller the gap between buying and selling price. This has gone so far on the American markets that for most of the larger stocks those two prices are the same \u2013 there is now just the one \u201cmarket\u201d price with no spread at all. This is less so in London and the smaller the stock, the less liquid the market in that stock, the less this is so again. Another way to think of the spread is what\u2019s the \u201ctax\u201d the market is imposing on us in order to be able to trade? The wider that spread the more we\u2019ve got to pay to trade in any particular instrument. Or, the same statement, the more the price has to move before we can profit from having taken a position. Compared to the market in general, AIQ is extreme in this but isn\u2019t wholly out of the ordinary in the world of matched bargains and offbook trading. That 20% price decline today, that\u2019s from 11p to 8.8p. Well, OK, that\u2019s the price change. But a likely trading volume is in the hundreds to thousands of shares in a day. That\u2019s not even every day either. Not hundreds of thousands, hundreds to thousands of AIQ shares traded in a day. The result of this is that the spread \u2013 the current quote from the London Stock Exchange at least \u2013 is 7 to 15p. Buy at 15, sell at 7. That is, we need a 100% or so price movement before we can be in profit even by only just beating that spread. It\u2019s possible that AIQ will turn out to be a good investment, possible that it won\u2019t. But with a spread like that, an active trading strategy will find it extraordinarily hard to make a profit. A useful little test for any trading that we do. What\u2019s the liquidity \u2013 how easily can we move in or out of a position? \u2013 and what\u2019s the spread \u2013 what\u2019s the price we\u2019ve got to pay t",

As stated previously, the Board undertook significant cost-cutting measures and a fundamental strategic review. Steps were taken to preserve cash while seeking to reposition the business by widening its focus beyond e-commerce. While it is early days, the Company has received interest in its IT solutions it can provide for blockchain technology and digital assets. AIQ is looking to capitalise on a lack of IT solutions providers specialising in delivery of blockchain platforms in Asia and to take advantage of the increasing popularity of decentralised finance and NFTs in the region. Strategically, the Company hopes to build the AIQ brand as a leading project manager and IT solutions provider in the Asia Pacific market. It is proposed that following the successful award of a contract, announced on 4 October 2021, to project manage a decentralised finance platform, the focus of the Company will be to build on this and support the management team and enable them to develop within this fast-growing sector. The initial step in this process will be to forge partnerships with key solutions providers so as to enable the Company to provide a full service, one-stop solution to potential clients.

Its shares have jumped 20% to 9p after it said its Hong Kong business Alcodes International had been awarded a contract to supply a non-fungible token marketplace and had established partnerships with two suppliers to deliver the project. The marketplace is designed to enable art schools and education centres in Hong Kong to assist their students in publishing NFTs. Alcodes International will oversee and manage the project, with the development of the marketplace being provided by software group Accubits Technologies and blockchain developer digiXnode Technology. It added that it would be able to extend the reach of the marketplace into China thanks to the partnership with digiXnode. Executive directodr Edwin Li said: \"We are delighted to have been awarded this contract and to have established partnerships with Accubits and digiXnode for its delivery. As we have previously stated, our strategic focus is on leveraging the demand for IT services for blockchain technology and digital assets. We're making good progress with our initial contract in this space, which is for the supply of a decentralised finance exchange, and this new project is a first step into the NFT market. We are particularly excited to be working with our new partners, and we hope to establish a long-term relationship with them.\" Outstanding",

The official launch of the Hong Kong and Macau service portal marks a step further for the BSN\u2019s overseas expansion plans. BSN International entered a soft launch stage for its portal in Hong Kong and Macau on Sept. 1, said Tim Bailey, vice president of global sales at Red Date Technology, the company China tapped to manage its BSN, in an interview last month with Forkast.News. In addition to launching portals to serve users in Hong Kong and Macau, Red Date has announced it is setting up BSN portals in South Korea, Turkey and Uzbekistan. Earlier this month, BSN said that it is partnering with Cypherium, a New York-based smart contract technology provider, to advance interoperability and enhance efficiency for central banks to develop and manage central bank digital currencies. In July 2020, the BSN separated into two ecosystems, BSN China and BSN International. BSN International, headquartered in Hong Kong, has integrated major public chains, which tend to focus on cryptocurrency and decentralized systems, while BSN China, which owns the majority of BSN\u2019s city nodes across the mainland, is a separate permission-based system that cannot access public chains deployed on BSN International.

          "content": "AIQ Limited (LON: AIQ) is an acquisition shell \u2013 a SPAC in the American \u2013 listed in London. The share price, as reported, has just fallen 20% this morning. So, is AIQ a good share to be viewing as a trading opportunity? One approach is to consider what AIQ actually does. Which, as an acquisition shell, isn\u2019t very much. Future value depends largely to near exclusively on who they identify as a merger candidate. As we don\u2019t know anything about that it\u2019s difficult for us to trade it. Another view is that we can observe that AIQ bounces around a bit so we could just have a position and hope to time matters correctly, get on the right side of those bounces. That\u2019s risky and not exactly a directed strategy. We can also do one of those things which we should take note of in anything and everything we try to trade. Which is to check the liquidity of a share. AIQ is \u201coffbook\u201d trading. That\u2019s very close to the older \u201cmatched bargain\u201d idea. There is no marketmaker willing to trade with all comers. Rather, a seller must be matched up with an end user buyer and vice versa in each and every trade. This means that the AIQ shares are illiquid. We should all know that liquidity reduces spreads. The more people buying and selling the same thing then the smaller the gap between buying and selling price. This has gone so far on the American markets that for most of the larger stocks those two prices are the same \u2013 there is now just the one \u201cmarket\u201d price with no spread at all. This is less so in London and the smaller the stock, the less liquid the market in that stock, the less this is so again. Another way to think of the spread is what\u2019s the \u201ctax\u201d the market is imposing on us in order to be able to trade? The wider that spread the more we\u2019ve got to pay to trade in any particular instrument. Or, the same statement, the more the price has to move before we can profit from having taken a position. Compared to the market in general, AIQ is extreme in this but isn\u2019t wholly out of the ordinary in the world of matched bargains and offbook trading. That 20% price decline today, that\u2019s from 11p to 8.8p. Well, OK, that\u2019s the price change. But a likely trading volume is in the hundreds to thousands of shares in a day. That\u2019s not even every day either. Not hundreds of thousands, hundreds to thousands of AIQ shares traded in a day. The result of this is that the spread \u2013 the current quote from the London Stock Exchange at least \u2013 is 7 to 15p. Buy at 15, sell at 7. That is, we need a 100% or so price movement before we can be in profit even by only just beating that spread. It\u2019s possible that AIQ will turn out to be a good investment, possible that it won\u2019t. But with a spread like that, an active trading strategy will find it extraordinarily hard to make a profit. A useful little test for any trading that we do. What\u2019s the liquidity \u2013 how easily can we move in or out of a position? \u2013 and what\u2019s the spread \u2013 what\u2019s the price we\u2019ve got to pay t",

As stated previously, the Board undertook significant cost-cutting measures and a fundamental strategic review. Steps were taken to preserve cash while seeking to reposition the business by widening its focus beyond e-commerce. While it is early days, the Company has received interest in its IT solutions it can provide for blockchain technology and digital assets. AIQ is looking to capitalise on a lack of IT solutions providers specialising in delivery of blockchain platforms in Asia and to take advantage of the increasing popularity of decentralised finance and NFTs in the region. Strategically, the Company hopes to build the AIQ brand as a leading project manager and IT solutions provider in the Asia Pacific market. It is proposed that following the successful award of a contract, announced on 4 October 2021, to project manage a decentralised finance platform, the focus of the Company will be to build on this and support the management team and enable them to develop within this fast-growing sector. The initial step in this process will be to forge partnerships with key solutions providers so as to enable the Company to provide a full service, one-stop solution to potential clients.

The marketplace is designed to enable art schools and education centres in Hong Kong to assist their students in publishing NFTs. Alcodes International will oversee and manage the project, with the development of the marketplace being provided by software group Accubits Technologies and blockchain developer digiXnode Technology. It added that it would be able to extend the reach of the marketplace into China thanks to the partnership with digiXnode. Executive directodr Edwin Li said: \"We are delighted to have been awarded this contract and to have established partnerships with Accubits and digiXnode for its delivery. As we have previously stated, our strategic focus is on leveraging the demand for IT services for blockchain technology and digital assets. We're making good progress with our initial contract in this space, which is for the supply of a decentralised finance exchange, and this new project is a first step into the NFT market. We are particularly excited to be working with our new partners, and we hope to establish a long-term relationship with them.\" Outstanding",

The official launch of the Hong Kong and Macau service portal marks a step further for the BSN\u2019s overseas expansion plans. BSN International entered a soft launch stage for its portal in Hong Kong and Macau on Sept. 1, said Tim Bailey, vice president of global sales at Red Date Technology, the company China tapped to manage its BSN, in an interview last month with Forkast.News. In addition to launching portals to serve users in Hong Kong and Macau, Red Date has announced it is setting up BSN portals in South Korea, Turkey and Uzbekistan. Earlier this month, BSN said that it is partnering with Cypherium, a New York-based smart contract technology provider, to advance interoperability and enhance efficiency for central banks to develop and manage central bank digital currencies. In July 2020, the BSN separated into two ecosystems, BSN China and BSN International. BSN International, headquartered in Hong Kong, has integrated major public chains, which tend to focus on cryptocurrency and decentralized systems, while BSN China, which owns the majority of BSN\u2019s city nodes across the mainland, is a separate permission-based system that cannot access public chains deployed on BSN International.
