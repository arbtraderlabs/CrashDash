In particular, we are excited about the significant opportunities in the data centre construction market through our strategic partnership with Centslink. We are working diligently to secure a project through leveraging our network and the strong track record of Centslink, and we hope to update shareholders on our progress in due course.\"\nOperational Review\nDuring the six months to 30 April 2025, the Group continued to seek to source IT services projects, primarily through its Alcodes International subsidiary in Hong Kong and with a focus on providing IT consultancy to supply digital infrastructure and platforms. While the Group did not secure or deliver any projects during the period, it is in advanced negotiations regarding a number of projects and expects to sign at least one contract by the end of the year.\nPost period end, as announced on 6 May 2025, the Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Centslink, a technology-driven enterprise specialising in the design, construction and delivery of data centre infrastructure and management, for the purpose of pursuing data centre construction projects. The Group has commenced pursuing opportunities, in Southeast Asia and internationally, and has already signed a Letter of Intent with a renewable energy provider based in the US with a view to constructing a data centre that would be powered by renewable electricity. While there can be no guarantee that this activity will result in the award of a contract or the generation of revenue, the Group's management believes that data centre construction represents a potentially sizable opportunity for the Group. This is due to the growing need for new data centres in regions such as Southeast Asia as well as the requirement to convert existing low-tier data centres to high-tier data centres to cater for the ever-increasing demand for power with minimal downtime.\nT\nhe Board continues to closely monitor the cash position and\u00a0is keeping all its strategic options open in assessing how best to deliver shareholder value. The Board is grateful for the ongoing support of its major shareholders.\nFinancial Review*\nThe Group did not generate revenue during the six months ended 30 April 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a3153k).\nAdministrative expenses were slightly reduced to \u00a3215k (H1 2024: \u00a3245k) as the Group continued to implement cost reduction measures. The operating loss was \u00a3218k (H1 2024: \u00a3175k loss).\nNet finance costs were maintained at \u00a315k (H1 2024: \u00a315k).\nLoss before tax for the period was \u00a3233k (H1 2024: \u00a3189k loss).\nThe Group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k at 30 April 2025 (31 October 2024: \u00a3\n30k\n). During the period, the Group entered non-interest bearing loan agreements with Li Chun Chung, an Executive Director of the Company, amounting to c. \u00a3295k, of which \u00a3270k was drawn down, and a further loan agreement post period of \u00a390k, which was fully drawn.\nThe Group continued to have the support of its major shareholders, with\nthe expiration date of the Group's convertible loan note facility being extended to 31 January 2027 during the period. All other details of the convertible loan note facility remained unchanged (see note 10 to the financial statements).\n* The comparative figures for H1 2024 are for continuing operations only (see the financial statements for further detail on discontinued operations)\nGoing Concern\nThe Group incurred losses of \u00a3233k during the period and cash outflows from operating activities of \u00a3274k. As at 30 April 2025, the Group had net current liabilities of \u00a3362k and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k. The Group's cash position was approximately \u00a377k as at 28 July 2025, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this report.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Directors take into account all available information for the foreseeable future, in particular for the 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. This information includes management prepared cash flows forecasts for the Group.\nThe Directors have assessed that to meet its forecasted cash requirements, the Group is dependent on cash generated from the new revenue contracts, continued support from its loan holders and/or obtaining further funding in the form of debt/equity. As discussed in Note 11, post period, the Company raised \u00a390k from an Executive Director. The significant shareholders of the Company have also indicated their intention to provide further support. The Directors are confident that the actions required to maintain the going concern position of the Group can be achieved as successfully demonstrated in the past. As a result, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nThe uncertainty around management estimation of winning new revenue contracts and/or obtaining additional funding gives rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Directors consider the Group to be a going concern but have identified a material uncertainty in this regard.\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nThe principal\u00a0risks and uncertainties\u00a0that could have a material impact on the Group's performance over the remaining half of the financial year have not changed from those that are set out in detail in the Group's annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 October 2024.\n\u00b7\nFinancial - The key financial risk is that of funding the continued development of the business with the current cash reserves whilst protecting shareholder value.\n\u00b7\nCompetition - The success of the Group is dependent on its ability to secure and deliver IT consultancy projects. The key risk to these activities is competition from other IT service providers, which may prevent the Group from winning business and/or result in pricing pressure.\n\u00b7\nSuppliers - Some of the Group's technical infrastructure and software is sourced from third-party suppliers and partners. The removal from the market of one or more of these third-party suppliers or interruption in supply could quickly and adversely affect the Group's operations and result in the loss of revenue or additional expenditure.\n\u00b7\nPeople - The Group operates in very competitive markets and the skills that its employees possess are attractive to other employers. Not having the right people and skills could negatively impact the Group's ability to service its customers and grow the business.\nResponsibilities Statement\nThe Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting;\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group;\n\u00b7\nthe Interim Report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the interim financial information, and a fair description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial information includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R, being the information required on related party transactions.\nA list of current directors is maintained on the Company's website:\nhttps://aiqhub.com/\nThe interim financial statements were approved by the

statements\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\nAIQ Limited (\"the Company\") was incorporated and registered in The Cayman Islands as a private company limited by shares on 11 October 2017 under the Companies Law (as revised) of The Cayman Islands, with the name AIQ Limited, and registered number 327983.\nThe Company's registered office is located at 5th Floor Genesis Building, Genesis Close, PO Box 446, Cayman Islands, KY1-1106.\nThe Company's ordinary shares are listed on the Equity Shares (Transition) category of the Official List and trade on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries (the \"Group\").\n2. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\nThe principal activities of the Group currently comprise the delivery of information technology (IT) solutions for clients through the provision of IT consultancy.\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\na) Basis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and International Accounting Standard 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" (IAS 34). Other than as noted below, the accounting policies applied by the Group in these condensed interim financial statements are the same as those set out in the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2024. These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and cover the six-month period to 30 April 2025.\nThese condensed financial statements do not include all of the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2024.\nThe condensed interim financial statements are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the auditors and were approved by the Board of Directors on 30 July 2025.\nThe financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), which is the presentational currency of the Company.\nA summary of the principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below.\nb) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to the end of the reporting period. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an investee if the Group has power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability to use its power to affect those variable returns.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity. Inter-company balances and transactions between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full. The financial information of subsidiaries is included in the Group's financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\nDuring the year to 31 October 2023, the Group discontinued its operation in Malaysia as part of its consolidation strategy to save cost and focus on operations in Hong Kong and therefore the comparatives in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income pertaining to discontinued operations were restated in line with IFRS 5\n- Non-current assets held for sale sand discontinued operations.\nc) Going concern\nThe Group incurred losses of \u00a3233k during the period and cash outflows from operating activities of \u00a3274k. As at 30 April 2025, the Group had net current liabilities of \u00a3362k and cash and cash equivalents of \u00a341k. The Group's cash position was approximately \u00a377k as at 28 July 2025, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this report.\nIn assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the Directors take into account all available information for the foreseeable future, in particular for the 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. This information includes management prepared cash flows forecasts for the Group.\nThe Directors have assessed that to meet its forecasted cash requirements, the Group is dependent on cash generated from the new revenue contracts, continued support from its loan holders and/or obtaining further funding in the form of debt/equity.\nAs discussed in Note 11, post period, the Company raised \u00a390k from an Executive Director.\nThe significant shareholders of the Company have also indicated their intention to provide further support. The Directors are confident that the actions required to maintain the going concern position of the Group can be achieved as successfully demonstrated in the past. As a result, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\nThe uncertainty around management estimation of winning new revenue contracts and/or obtaining additional funding gives rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\nTherefore, the Directors consider the Group to be a going concern but have identified a material uncertainty in this regard.\n4. SUBSIDIARIES\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries (the \"Group\") as follows:\nName\nPlace of incorporation\nRegistered address\nPrincipal activity\nEffective interest\n30.04.2025\n31.10.2024\nAlchemist Codes Sdn Bhd*\nMalaysia\n2-9, Jalan Puteri 4/8, Bandar Puteri, 47100 Puchong, Selangor Darul\nEhsan\nMalaysia\nDesign and development of software\nN/A\n1\n00%\nAlcodes International Limited\nHong Kong\nRoom 47, Smart-Space FinTech, Level 4, Core E, Cyberport 3, 100 Cyberport Road, Hong Kong\nSoftware and app development\n100%\n1\n00%\n* On 31 October 2023, the Company commenced the strike off process to dispose of its subsidiary Alchemist Codes Sdn Bhd and the company was finally dissolved on 17 February 2025.

SEGMENT REPORTING\nIFRS 8 defines operating segments as those activities of an entity about which separate financial information is available and which are evaluated by the Board of Directors to assess performance and determine the allocation of resources. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that under IFRS 8 the Group has only one operating segment,\ninformation technology product and services\n. The Board of Directors assesses the performance of the operating segment using financial information that is measured and presented in a manner consistent with that in the Financial Statements.\nAll revenues were derived from Asia.\n7. LOSS PER SHARE\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share information for its ordinary shares. Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the reporting period. Diluted loss per share is determined by adjusting the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares\n.\nThere is no difference between the basic and diluted loss per share, as the Company's warrants and loan notes are anti-dilutive in nature and therefore the diluted loss per share has not been presented.\nSix months ended 30 April 2025\nSix months ended 30 April 2024\nYear ended 31 October 2024\nLoss attributable to ordinary shareholders (\u00a3)\n(232,824)\n(189,375)\n(269,417\nContinuing operations\n(232,824)\n(189,375)\n(267,656)\nDiscontinued operations\n-\n-\n(1,761)\nBasic - Weighted average number of shares\n64,760,721\n64,760,721\n64,760,721\nBasic loss per share (expressed as \u00a3 per share)\nfrom continuing operations\n(0.004)\n(0.003)\n(0.004)\nfrom discontinued operations\n-\n-\n(0.00003)\n8.
