Our upcoming AI platform, built on Agentic architecture, will further strengthen our offering, helping clients unlock value across sales, productivity and stock. As investment appetite returns, we are confident our pipeline will convert, reinforcing our role as a trusted partner in retail transformation.\"\nEnquiries:\nItim Group plc\nAli Athar, CEO\nIan Hayes CFO\n0207 598 7700\nZeus (NOMAD & Broker)\nKaty Mitchell\nHarry Ansell\nDarshan Patel\n0203 829 5000\nIFC Advisory\nGraham Herring\nFlorence Staton\n0207 3934 6630\nABOUT ITIM\nitim was established in 1993 by its founder, and current Chief Executive Officer, Ali Athar. itim was initially formed as a consulting business, helping retailers effect operational improvement. From 1999 the Company began to expand into the provision of proprietary software solutions and by 2004 the Company was focused exclusively on digital technology. itim has grown both organically and through a series of acquisitions of small, legacy retail software systems and associated applications which itim has redeveloped to create a fully integrated end to end Omni-channel platform.\nCEO Statement\nThe Board is pleased to present the Group's half year results for 2025 in which the business reports good annual recurring revenue and a positive EBITDA.\nThe first six months of the year have been influenced by the cost pressures currently affecting the retail sector. These pressures have inevitably affected the pace of activity within our business, with a number of projects being pushed back, particularly those involving substantial investment commitments. Whilst the Group has not lost ongoing business, delays in decision-making have occurred and naturally impacted performance. At the same time, it is important to note that the interim results for 2024 included a significant contribution from large-scale project revenues generated through The Entertainers partnership with Tesco.\nIt is widely acknowledged that UK retailers are battling with what has been described as a \"perfect storm\" of cost pressures. These include an increasing burden of taxation and regulatory levies, continued upward pressure on wage and employment costs, and the broader impact of inflationary forces. Collectively, these factors are eroding margins, suppressing profitability, and forcing retailers to reassess both pricing strategies and investment priorities.\nConsumer confidence, meanwhile, remains fragile. Persistent inflation, rising household debt and ongoing concerns over job security, have constrained discretionary spending. Retailers, faced with the difficult balance of managing higher costs while maintaining competitiveness, have passed some of these pressures onto consumers through increased pricing. As a result, demand dynamics on the high street remain subdued, and the outlook for the crucial Christmas trading period is uncertain. In turn, these uncertainties have led many retailers to defer or scale back investment in longer-term transformation programmes.\nWithin this difficult trading environment, itim's business model is considered an attractive proposition providing an effective way for retailers to mitigate rising costs and invest in operational efficiency and technology. Areas such as process automation, digital transformation, and supply chain optimisation are increasingly being recognised as essential levers for long-term resilience. Encouragingly, the Group is seeing evidence of retailers adopting these strategies offered by our products and services.\nThe current pipeline of new opportunities is encouraging and reflects both the relevance of itim's solutions and the confidence in its ability to deliver value. That said, given the current macro and retail environments, projects are taking longer to close, and some have been pushed back into later periods. In the short term, the Group remains disciplined in managing costs and has taken appropriate action to minimise the impact on profitability while protecting its capacity to deliver ensuring that the Group remains well positioned to respond to new levels of interest.\nThe Group is continuing its focus on machine learning and the use of advanced mathematics in building systems. This year, itim will be launching its AI platform based on an Agentic AI architecture, where a number of of 'agents' will sit on top of our UNIFY platform to help retailers identify opportunities to optimise sales, productivity, margin and stock.\nIn conclusion, while the present trading environment remains challenging the Group is experiencing increased levels of interest for its services.

General information\nitim Group plc is a public limited Company (\"Company\") incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 (registration number 03486926). The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is 2nd Floor, Atlas House, 173 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5NH. The Company's ordinary shares are admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (\"AIM\").\nThe Group's principal activities have been the provision of technology solutions to help clients drive improvements in efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe Group's interim report and accounts for the six months ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared using the recognition and measurement principles of International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations as endorsed by the European Union (collectively \"Adopted IFRS\").\nThese interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The interim report and accounts do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements.\nThe interim report and accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation as set out in the Group's December 2024 Annual Report and Accounts, except for those that relate to new standards and interpretations effective for the first time for periods beginning on (or after) 1 January 2025, and will be adopted in the 2024 annual financial statements.\nThe interim report and accounts do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. These interim financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 24th September 2025. The results for the six months to 30 June 2025 and the comparative results for the six months to 30 June 2024 are unaudited. The figures for the period ended 31 December 2024 are extracted from the audited statutory accounts of the Group for that period.\nThe Directors believe that a combination of the Group's current cash, projected revenues from existing and future contracts will enable the Group to meet its obligations and to implement its business plan in full. Inherently, there can be no certainty in these matters, but the Directors believe that the Group's internal trading forecasts are realistic and that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.\n2.\nEarnings per share\nBasic and diluted (loss)/earning per share is calculated by dividing the (loss)/profit attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. For the avoidance of doubt the deferred shares have been excluded as they have no rights to profits or capital. The Company's share options have a dilutive effect over the two year period.\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\nUnaudited\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nUnaudited\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nAudited\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\n\u00a3000\nProfit/(Loss) after tax for the year\n(500)\n(85)\n200\nExceptional items\n-\n141\n141\nShare option charge\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted loss after tax for the year\n(500)\n56\n341\nWeighted average number of shares\nBasic - 000\n31,304\n31,211\n31,211\nPotentially dilutive share options - 000\n3,546\n3,657\n3,657\nDiluted average number of shares - 000\n34,850\n34,868\n34,868\nEarnings per share:\nBasic - pence on continuing operations\n(1.60)\n(0.27)\n0.64\nDiluted - pence on continuing operations\n(1.60)\n(0.27)\n0.57\nAdjusted earnings - Basic - pence on continuing operations\n(1.60)\n0.18\n1.09\nAdjusted earnings - Diluted - pence on continuing operations\n(1.60)\n0.16\n0.98\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Our performance over the past year has been especially strong, underscoring the resilience of our business model, the dedication of our team, and the continued trust placed in us by our customers and shareholders.\nAs highlighted in our trading update in February 2025, we were extremely pleased to report numbers that were significantly ahead of market expectations at the time. This achievement is a testament to the hard work of our team and the value we continue to deliver to our customers. The cost efficiencies we offer to the retail industry have driven increased demand for our products, reinforcing our position as a trusted partner in the sector.\nWe were especially proud of the strategic milestones reached in 2024. We secured a five-year multi-million-pound contract with Assa\u00ed Atacadista, Brazil's largest wholesaler, which leveraged our UNIFY Price & Promotions Optimisation solution powered by Profimetrics AI to enhance its pricing strategies. Additionally, we signed a five-year contract extension with toy retailer The Entertainer, as it expanded its use of our Unify Platform to support its partnership with Tesco and also renewed our long-standing partnership with Majestic Wine, the UK's largest specialist wine retailer, for another five years. This subscription renewal for our UNIFY platform covered a wide range of operations, from EPOS and e-commerce to stock management and business intelligence, reinforcing our commitment to providing comprehensive, integrated solutions.\nWe are also pleased to welcome Dennis Layton as Non-Executive Director to the Board. Dennis brings a wealth of experience in management consulting and organisational transformation, and his insights will undoubtedly strengthen our strategic direction.\nAs we look ahead, we remain mindful of the broader market backdrop and potential challenges. However, our continued investment in innovation, operational excellence, and customer-centricity gives us confidence in our long-term prospects. Our focus remains on delivering sustainable growth, expanding our client relationships, and providing best-in-class solutions that empower retailers to thrive.\nI would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my predecessor, Michael Jackson, for his exceptional leadership and unwavering support during his tenure as Chairman.\nFinally, I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders for their continued trust, to our customers for their partnership, and to our employees for their dedication.\nColin Price\nChairman\n12th May 2025\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW\nI am pleased to present our Annual Report for 2024, the most pivotal year for itim since our IPO. We have successfully returned the business to profitability, with EBITDA increasing by 260%, transforming a \u00a30.9m loss in 2023 into a \u00a30.2m profit in 2024. This strong financial performance was further reinforced by a significant year-end cash balance of \u00a33.8m, positioning us well for future growth and investment.\nAs we reflect on another year, we are proud of the substantial progress we have made in shaping the retail technology landscape. Over the past two decades, itim has made a substantial investment in the continuous development of our UNIFY platform, which has become the cornerstone of our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions for retailers.\nWe live in a competitive world, with well-established players such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft competing at the large end of the market, and hundreds of best-of-breed vendors targeting niche components of the retail value chain at the smaller end. Against this backdrop, our mission is clear: to differentiate ourselves by focusing on delivering tangible business outcomes for our customers.\nDespite ongoing investment in technology, we consider many UK retailers have lacked significant productivity improvements and with the current Government imposed cost increases, profitability is declining. Recent research by itim of 120 mid-sized UK retailers revealed that 85% of retailers are reporting profits under 5% of turnover. We believe this highlights the pressing need for solutions that go beyond mere software and directly address the fundamental challenge of profitability.\nAs experts in retail, we firmly believe that technology should do more than simply automate processes, it must drive measurable business outcomes. Our focus on helping retailers increase revenues, reduce costs, improve margins, and optimise working capital is what truly sets itim apart. The UNIFY platform is not just about enhancing operational efficiency; it is designed to empower our clients to thrive in an increasingly complex and competitive retail environment. By aligning technology with tangible business goals, we enable our customers to not only meet today's challenges but to seize new opportunities for growth and profitability.\nHistorically many companies turn to management consultancies to guide them through business transformation and help them put together their technology platforms by integrating best of breed software vendors with ERP systems. We recognise that such engagement is often very expensive and beyond the reach of many retailers. This is where itim can provide significant value. Our solution is designed to ensure that our customers can navigate today's challenges without the prohibitive costs traditionally associated with digital transformation. By offering both a sophisticated fully integrated technology platform and the expertise to drive real business outcomes, we believe we are one of the few players capable of helping retailers succeed in a rapidly evolving market.\nA core aspect of our strategy in 2024 was to increase our focus on services revenue. By helping our customers maximise the value of our platform, we are not only improving their profitability but also strengthening our own financial position. Services revenue create a strong pipeline for future growth which allows us to further solidify customer relationships and generate references which we believe is the best route for acquiring new customers. As we acquire new customers, we are confident these will not only translate into increased subscription revenues which strengthens our long-term future but also provide services revenues in the short term as newly acquired customers continue to maximise their use of our platform as we deliver proven success.\nAs we look to the future, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. In the current economic environment, the need for retail technology that can drive profitability and business transformation is greater than ever. With a strong pipeline of new customers and a solid track record of delivering superior outcomes, we are well-positioned for continued success. Our commitment to providing both cutting-edge technology and business results ensures that itim remains a trusted partner to retailers striving to stay ahead of the curve.\nIn closing, we are confident that our strategy, rooted in a commitment to delivering business outcomes, driving profitability, and offering an affordable path to transformation for our customers will continue to set us apart in the marketplace. We remain deeply committed to helping our customers succeed, and we look forward to the next chapter of growth and innovation at itim.\nAli Athar\nChief Executive officer\n12th May 2025\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER'S REVIEW\nIncome Statement\nOverview\nIn the 2023 Annual report, the Board set out itim's strategic shift in business focus from subscription growth to prioritising profitability and cashflow through driving services revenues to adapt to global uncertainties and market conditions.\nI am pleased to report strong progress in the first year of our strategic shift, with EBITDA increasing significantly to \u00a32.5m from \u00a30.7m in 2023. Notably, the business has delivered a positive swing from a \u00a30.9m loss in 2023 to a \u00a30.2m profit in 2024, a clear indication of the effectiveness of our strategy and the resilience of our operating model.\nRevenue\nOur revenue streams are split between subscription revenues generated from contracts which provide long term growth, sustainability and stability to the business, and short-term services project revenues which drive profitability and cash. Revenues for the year were \u00a317.9m up from \u00a316.1m in 2023, an increase of 11%. With subscription revenues remaining relatively steady during the year, the increase was largely due to an increase in project revenues which rose by 34%.\nDespite the shift towards driving services revenues, the quality and certainty of recurring revenues as a percentage of total turnover remained high at 75% (2023: 79%).\nGross profit\nWith increased focus on project revenues, whilst ensuring an appropriate cost base to deliver those projects, the gross profit margin increased to 40.1% up from 31.2% in 2023.\nFurthermore, with excess capacity in our hosting environment, as new subscription revenues are on boarded to the hosting infrastructure, these will contribute to improving margins without incurring additional costs to the Company.\nAdministrative expenses\nAs anticipated, the administrative cost base increased by 8% over 2023 due to bonuses paid to the performing proposition teams. As a percentage of sales, administrative expenses have decreased from 27% in 2023 to 26% in 2024 and we only anticipate large fluctuations in overhead costs due to increased marketing spend.\nForeign exchange rates\nWith 30% of ARR denominated in foreign currencies at the year end, and with sterling at a three year high against the Euro and the Brazilian Real at 31st December 2024, it is inevitable that ARR decreased due to the impact of foreign exchange movements as Sterling strengthened by 25% against the Real representing 17% of our ARR and 5% against the Euro representing 8% of the year end balances.\nThe table below sets out the percentage of annual contracts in the foreign currencies in which we trade and its impacts.\nFX Rates\n31-Dec-23\n31-Dec-24\n2024\n2023 Average\n2024 Average\n2024\n(% of ARR at year end)\nFX rate\nFX rate\nVariance %\nFX rate\nFX rate\nVariance %\n\u00a3GBP/Euro (ARR 8%)\n1.153\n1.210\n5%\n1.149\n1.165\n1%\n\u00a3GBP/BRL (ARR 17%)\n6.180\n7.744\n25%\n6.209\n6.139\n-1%\n\u00a3GBP/USD (ARR 5%)\n1.273\n1.252\n-2%\n1.243\n1.263\n2%\nDespite the substantial strengthening of Sterling at the year end, foreign exchange rates remained relatively static during the year with minimal volatility on the P&L.\nTaxation\nThe Group continues to take advantage of R&D tax credits as it continues to innovate its technology offering. The current year tax credit is made of up of a net current tax credit of \u00a30.22m (2023: \u00a30.34m) and a deferred tax charge of \u00a30.19m (2023: \u00a30.13m).\nEarnings/(Loss) per share\nBasic EPS for the year was 0.64p (2023: -2.86p) and the diluted EPS was 0.57p (2023: -2.86p).\nOn an adjusted profit basis after adjusting for exceptional items and the share option charge the adjusted earnings basic EPS was 1.09p (2023: -2.86p) and the adjusted earnings diluted EPS was 0.98p (2023: -2.86p).\nDividend\nThe Board does not propose to pay a dividend in respect of the financial year (2023: \u00a3nil).\nGroup Statement of Financial position\nThe Group had net assets of \u00a311.6m at 31st December 2024 (2023: \u00a311.5m) an increase of \u00a30.1m attributable to the total comprehensive income for the year.\nCash flow and working capital\nThe Group ended the year with a cash balance of \u00a33.8m (2023: \u00a31.9m).\nCash generated from operating activities for the year amounted to \u00a34.18m (2023: \u00a30.53m). There were no further inflows from investing activities during the year (2023: \u00a3nil). Cash expended on capitalised product development was \u00a31.66m (2023: \u00a31.95m) payment of interest, lease liabilities and equipment amounted to \u00a30.64m (2023: \u00a30.54m). No loans were made in the year (2023: \u00a3nil). Which taken together with our opening cash balance of \u00a31.9m gives the closing cash balance at the year-end.\nEquity\nThere were no changes in equity during the year.\nIan Hayes\nChief Financial

Corporate Information\nThe consolidated financial statements of ITIM Group plc and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2024 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 12th May 2025. itim Group plc (\"the Company\") is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (the \"Group\") are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 11 and the Directors' report on pages 26 to 27.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared under IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\") interpretations in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nThe Company's financial statements have been prepared under IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\") interpretations in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the company. The Company made a profit of \u00a3650,823 for the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: \u00a3923,983)\nThe financial statements are presented in GBP, which is also the company's functional currency.\nAmounts are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.\n3. Summary of significant accounting policies\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the ability to exercise control and are accounted for as subsidiaries. The results of subsidiaries are included in the Group income statement from the date of acquisition until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated upon consolidation.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue was recognised to the extent that it was probable that the economic benefits would flow to the Group and the revenue could be reliably measured.\nRevenue represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the provision of goods and services to third party customers during the year by the group. Revenue is derived from the Group's principal activity and excludes VAT.\nThe Group derives revenue from two principal sources as noted below:\nRecurring revenue\n1. Recurring revenue consists of:\n\u00b7\nSubscriptions - revenue from subscriptions derive from the Group's hosted software-as-a-service subscription application, which allows customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. Revenue is recognised over the contract period, commencing on the date of the service go live which gives the customer the right-to-use and access the platform.\n\u00b7\nSupport and maintenance - derive from support services and software upgrades offered to customers using the Group's software products. Revenue is recognised over the contract period, commencing on the go-live date of the implementation which gives the customer the right to access support services and the right to receive upgrades.\n2. One off revenue\nOne off revenue consists of:\n\u00b7\nLicences - the performance obligation for the provision of licences is considered to be satisfied when the agreement is signed by the customer and they are given access to the related software intellectual property (\"IP\") without any requirement to provide updates. It is recognised in full at the transaction price and over the period of implementation before the go live date of the implementation.\n\u00b7\nServices - Services revenue relate to design and implementation services for each customer. Services enhance an asset that the customer controls and the Group creates specific fit for purpose assets which cannot be used elsewhere. The transaction price is the amount determined by fixed price contracts or on a time and materials basis where the Group has a right for consideration for work performed to date. Under the terms of the contracts, the Group has a right to invoice at the achievement of various milestones in the contract.\n\u00b7\nServices are recognised over time and management consider the time spent as a proportion of total time expected is the most appropriate basis for recognition of this revenue stream as staff time is the main input into the delivery of the service. Any differences to the revenue measured by the above method and the amounts invoiced are included in the balance sheet. Further information on the contracts assets or contract liabilities are included in note 4.\nIntangible assets - Goodwill\nGoodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require. In most cases the Group identified its cash generating units as one level below that of an operating segment. Cash flows at this level are substantially independent from other cash flows and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored. A goodwill impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income whenever and to the extent that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the unit's recoverable amount, which is the greater of value in use and fair value less cost to sell.\nNegative goodwill relating to intangible fixed assets requires immediate recognition in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nIn calculating goodwill, the total consideration, both actual and deferred, is taken into account. Where the deferred consideration is contingent and dependent upon future trading performance, an estimate of the present value of the likely consideration payable is made. This contingent consideration is re-assessed annually. The difference between the present value and the total amount payable at a future date gives rise to a finance charge which is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and credited to the liability over the period in which the consideration is deferred. The discount used approximates to market rates.\nIntangible assets - research and development expenditure\nResearch expenditure is written off as incurred. Internally generated development expenditure is also written off, except where the directors are satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In such cases, the identifiable expenditure is capitalised and amortised over the period during which the group is expected to benefit. This period is seven years. Provisions are made for any impairment.\nIntangible assets - other\nOther intangible assets recognised in these financial statements consist of Customer contracts and relationships and Intellectual Property Rights acquired on the acquisition of EDI Plus Limited along with the purchase of the intellectual property rights of software.\nAmortisation is calculated to write off their cost or valuation less any residual value over their estimated useful lives as follows:\nCustomer contracts and relationships - straight line over 10 years\nIntellectual Property Rights - straight line over 10 years\nIntellectual property rights of software - straight line over 7 years\nThe amortisation of intangible fixed assets is shown as a separate line in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nThe carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nImpairment non-current assets\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units. A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.\nAny impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nForeign currencies\nTransactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate ruling at that date. All exchange differences are dealt with in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of gain or loss on change in fair value in the item.\nFor consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Profit and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rate of exchange during the year. Exchange differences arising are included in a separate component of equity.\nPlant and equipment\nPlant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. Cost comprises the aggregate amount paid to acquire asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.\nDepreciation of plant and equipment is calculated to write off their cost or valuation less any residual value over their estimated useful lives as follows:\nComputer equipment - straight line over 3 years\nOffice equipment - straight line over 3 years\nFixtures and fittings - straight line over 3 years\nThe assets' residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate on an annual basis. An asset is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the period that the asset is derecognised. The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nFixed asset investments\nSubsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment.\nInvestments are reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Provision is made for any impairment.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade and other receivables are initially stated at their fair value plus transaction costs, then subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method if applicable, less impairment losses. Provisions against trade and other receivables are made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to them in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of cash management are included as components of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are recognised at original cost.\nLoans and borrowings\nLoans and borrowings are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.\nLeases - as a lessee\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of fixed lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset with similar terms, security and conditions.\nLease payments are allocated between principal and finance costs. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the initial measurement of lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, and any initial direct costs.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\nPayments associated with low-value items and leases of a duration less than 1 year are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis.\nIncome taxes\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax is calculated on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled based on the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nFinance costs\nFinance costs comprise interest payable on loans from directors and third parties and are recognised on an accruals basis.\nShare-based payments\nThe group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group's estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions\nFair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes Model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.\nPension contributions\nThe company operates a defined contribution scheme for its employees. Contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year they are payable. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group.\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred.\nA financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.\nUse of assumptions and estimates\nThe Group makes judgements, estimates and assumptions that effect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The resulting accounting estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results but are based on historical experience and expectations of future events. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision effects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision effects both current and future periods.\nThe judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below.\nUseful economic lives of intangible assets\nIntangible assets are amortised over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in variations in the carrying values and amounts charged to the statement of comprehensive income in specific periods.\nChange in accounting policies\n(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Company\nThe following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1st January 2024. The Group has assessed their impact and adopted the relevant changes in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nKey amendments that have had a material impact include:\nAmendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (effective 1 January 2024) - These amendments clarify the criteria for classifying liabilities and address how covenants affect classification.\n(b) New standards, interpretations, and amendments not yet effective\nA number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods but have not been early adopted by the Group. These include:\nAmendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments: Contractual Cash Flow Characteristics (effective 1 January 2025) - This clarifies how to assess contractual terms of financial assets for classification purposes.\nAmendments to IFRS 17 - Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information (effective 1 January 2025) - These amendments provide transition relief for insurers when first applying IFRS 17.\nLack of Exchangeability - Amendments to IAS 21 (effective 1 January 2025) - These amendments clarify the criteria for determining whether a currency is exchangeable and how to estimate an appropriate exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking. The Group is currently assessing the impact of these amendments on its foreign currency transactions and financial statement presentation.\nThe Group is currently assessing the potential impact of these new standards and amendments on future financial statements.\n4. Segmental reporting\nThe chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") for the purpose of IFRS 8 is the Board. Segments are determined by reference to the internal reports reviewed by the Board. The group's operations relate to the provision of technology solutions to help clients drive revenues and profit.\nThe Group measures the performance of its operating segments through a measure of segment profit or loss which is referred to as EBITDA. This measure is reported to the CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance. The measure is the same as reported in the historic financial information.\nInformation about geographic location by key segments\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nUK\nPortugal\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n13,055\n4,853\n17,908\nNon-current assets\n10,219\n2,034\n12,253\nYear ended 31 December 2023\nUK\nPortugal\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n11,650\n4,480\n16,130\nNon-current assets\n10,608\n2,094\n12,702\nInformation about major customers\nTransactions with a single customer exceeding 10% of total revenue amounted to \u00a36,243K in the year (2023: \u00a35,381K) and related to 2 customers (2023: 2).\n5.

Contracts are classified assets when only the act of invoice is pending, there is an unconditional right to receive cash and only the passage of time is required as per contractual terms.\nContract liabilities (\"deferred income\") are recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues. Contracts are classified as liabilities when there is an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration from the customer (or the payment is due) but the transfer has not yet completed. These arise based on the billing cycle of the Group's revenues and all are expected to be reversed in under one year.\n6.\nProfit/(Loss) on operating activities before taxation\nLoss on ordinary activities before taxation is stated after charging:\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nExceptional Items\n141\n-\nDeprecation of owned tangible fixed assets\n62\n49\nDepreciation of leased assets\n594\n545\nAmortisation of intangible assets\n1,400\n1,146\nAuditors' remuneration (see note 7)\n70\n70\nExceptional items relate to costs incurred in relation to the staff restructuring and redundancies\n7.\nAuditors' remuneration\nThe analysis of auditors' remuneration is as follows:\n2024\u00a3'000\n2023\u00a3'000\nFees payable to the company's auditors for the audit of the company's annual accounts\n36\n37\nFees payable to the company's auditors and their associates for other services to the group\n\u2022\nThe audit of the company's subsidiaries pursuant to legislation\n29\n28\n\u2022\nTax compliance services\n5\n5\nTotal other services\n70\n70\n8.\nEmployee information\nTheir aggregate emoluments were:\n2024\u00a3'000\n2023\u00a3'000\nWages and salaries\n8,509\n8,701\nSocial security costs\n1,223\n1,263\nOther pension costs\n294\n307\nOther benefits\n351\n338\n10,377\n10,609\nThe average monthly number of employees (including directors) during the year for the group was as follows:\n2024No.\n2023No.\nSelling and administration\n28\n29\nTechnical\n138\n144\n166\n173\n9.\nDirectors' emoluments\n2024\u00a3'000\n2023\u00a3'000\nAggregate emoluments\n1,094\n970\nPension contributions (money purchase schemes)\n40\n39\n1,134\n1,009\nDirectors' emoluments disclosed above include the following payments to the highest director:\n2024\u00a3'000\n2023\u00a3'000\nAggregate emoluments\n396\n347\nPension contributions (money purchase schemes)\n17\n17\n413\n364\n2024No.\n2023No.\nNumber of directors to whom relevant benefits are accruing under:\nMoney purchase schemes\n2\n2\nThe above is equivalent to total key management personnel compensation. There were no other key management personnel other than the Directors.\nFurther details of Directors remuneration can be found in the remuneration report on pages 24 to 25.\nShare based compensation\nThe Group operates an equity-settled share based compensation plan for Directors and executives. In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has elected to implement the measurement requirements of IFRS 2 in respect of only those equity-settled share options that were granted after 7 November 2002 and that had not vested as at 1 January 2005. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted at the grant date.\nAt each year end date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the Statement of Consolidated Income, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. When share options are cancelled the Group accounts for the cancellation as an acceleration of vesting and therefore recognises immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised. The fair value of share options has been assessed using the Black Scholes Model.\n250,000 share options were granted to Directors in the period (2023 - Nil).\nIncluded on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income, is a total charge for share based payments of \u00a3Nil (2023: \u00a3Nil) which arises wholly from transactions accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.\n10.\nTaxation\n(a) Taxation charge:\n2024\u00a3'000\n2023\u00a3'000\nTotal current income tax credit charged in the income statement\nResearch and development tax credit\nPortugal corporate tax\n(220)\n15\n(400)\n19\nAdjustment in respect of prior years\n(11)\n40\nTotal current income tax\n(217)\n(341)\nDeferred tax expense\nCurrent year\n191\n136\n191\n136\nTotal income tax\n(25)\n(205)\n(b) Taxation reconciliation:\nThe current income tax credit for the year is explained below:\n2024\u00a3'000\n2023\u00a3'000\nLoss before tax\n175\n(1,097)\nLoss at the standard UK income tax rate of 19% (2023: 19%)\n33\n(208)\nEffects of:\nExpenses not deductible for tax purposes\n181\n153\nCapital allowances in excess of depreciation\n46\n44\nTax losses utilised as part of research and development tax credit\n(220)\n(400)\nUnrelieved tax losses and other deductions arising in the year\n(13)\n98\nB/fwd losses relieved\n(213)\n(96)\nAdjustment in respect of earlier year\n(11)\n40\nDifference in overseas tax rates and temporary GAAP differences\n(19)\n28\nOther deferred tax timing differences\n191\n136\nTotal income tax credited in the income statement\n(25)\n(205)\nc) Deferred tax\nThe movements in the Group's deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year are as follows:\nGroup\nCompany\nDeferred tax asset\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCategory:\nAcceleration capital allowances on PPE - UK\n-\n(15)\n-\n-\nAccelerated capital allowances on development costs - UK\n-\n(734)\nTax losses available for carry forward - UK\n-\n760\n-\n-\nOther timing differences - UK\n-\n2\n-\n-\nAt 31 December\n-\n13\n-\n-\nGroup\nCompany\nDeferred tax liability\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCategory:\nAcceleration capital allowances on PPE - UK\n(40)\n(71)\n(20)\n(71)\nAcceleration capital allowances on development costs - UK\n(796)\n-\n-\n-\nTax losses available for carry forward - UK\n551\n-\n-\n-\nOther timing differences - UK\n6\n(1)\n3\n(1)\nArising on business combinations - UK\n(137)\n(161)\n-\n-\nAcceleration capital allowances on development costs - Portugal\n(379)\n(382)\n-\n-\nOther timing differences - Portugal\n2\n-\n-\n-\nAt 31 December\n(793)\n(615)\n(17)\n(72)\nGroup\nCompany\nDeferred tax movement\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nThe movement on the deferred tax balance during the year is as follows:\nDeferred Tax Asset\n-\n13\n-\n-\nDeferred Tax Liability\n(793)\n(615)\n(17)\n(72)\nNet Deferred Tax Balance\n(793)\n(602)\n(17)\n(72)\nCharged to profit or loss\n191\n134\n(55)\n(12)\nUnrecognised Deferred Tax Assets\nThe Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried forward.

Earnings/(Loss) per share\nBasic and diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. For the avoidance of doubt the deferred shares have been excluded as they have no rights to profits or capital. Additionally, the Company's ordinary shares were subject to a share consolidation where 5 ordinary shares were converted into 1 ordinary share. The comparative period weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for this to aid comparison. The Company's share options have a dilutive effect over the two-year period.\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfit/(Loss) after tax for the year\n200\n(892)\nShare option charge\nExceptional items\n-\n141\n-\nAdjusted profit/loss after tax for the year\n341\n(892)\nWeighted average number of shares:\nBasic - 000\n31,211\n31,211\nPotentially dilutive share options - 000\n3,657\n3,657\nDiluted average number of shares - 000\n34,868\n34,868\nProfit/(Loss) per share:\nBasic - pence on continuing operations\n0.64\n(2.86)\nDiluted - pence on continuing operations\n0.57\n(2.86)\nAdjusted earnings/(loss) - Basic - pence on continuing operations\n1.09\n(2.86)\nAdjusted Diluted - pence on continuing operations\n0.98\n(2.86)\n12.\nIntangible assets\nGroup\nPurchase of software\nDevelopment cost\nGoodwill\nAcquired intellectual property rights\nCustomer contracts\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCost\nAt 1 January 2024\n350\n17,488\n8,712\n300\n1,000\n27,850\nForeign exchange differences\n-\n(161)\n-\n-\n-\n(161)\nAdditions\n-\n1,593\n-\n-\n-\n1,593\nAt 31 December 2024\n350\n18,920\n8,712\n300\n1,000\n29,282\nAmortisation\nAt 1 January 2024\n-\n11,527\n4,759\n105\n350\n16,741\nForeign exchange differences\n-\n(88)\n-\n-\n-\n(88)\nCharge for the period\n50\n1,220\n-\n30\n100\n1,400\nAt 31 December 2024\n50\n12,659\n4,759\n135\n450\n18,053\nNet book value\nAt 31 December 2024\n300\n6,261\n3,953\n165\n550\n11,229\nAt 31 December 2023\n350\n5,961\n3,953\n195\n650\n11,109\nGoodwill arising prior to 1 January 2020 relates to acquisition prior to the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2015 and therefore the exemption for business combinations completed before that date has been applied and the amounts not restated.\nThe Board consider that there is only one Cash Generating Unit.

These are all measured at amortised cost. The financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade payables and accruals, lease liabilities and deferred consideration payable for acquisitions of subsidiaries. These are measured at amortised cost.\nThe majority of the financial instruments arise directly from the operations with the exception of loans and borrowings and lease liabilities which have been used to finance the operations.\nFair values of financial instruments\nFor the following financial assets and liabilities: trade and other payables, trade and other receivables and cash at bank and in hand, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument. The Directors consider that there is no material difference between book value and fair value for any of the financial instruments held.\nFinancial risk management\nThe Group's activities expose the Group to a number of risks including capital management risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.\nIt is the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken.\nThere have been no substantive changes in the Group's exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group's risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group's finance function. The Board receives monthly reports from the Finance Department through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group's competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:\nInterest rate risk\nThere is no interest rate risk as there are no borrowings in the Group.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.\nThe Group's largest financial assets are the cash balances held in banks and it is exposed to credit risk on those balances. It is the Group's policy only to make deposits with banks with an acceptable credit rating.\nThe Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts. Such credit ratings are taken into account by local business practices. An ageing analysis of trade receivables is detailed below:\n2024\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\nCurrent\n\u00a3'000\n30-60 days\n\u00a3'000\n> 60 days\n\u00a3'000\nTrade and other receivables\n2,544\n1,569\n794\n181\nContract assets\n214\n214\n-\n-\n2,758\n1,783\n794\n181\n2023\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\nCurrent\n\u00a3'000\n30-60 days\n\u00a3'000\n> 60 days\n\u00a3'000\nTrade and other receivables\n4,075\n1,898\n1,629\n548\nContract assets\n287\n287\n-\n-\n4,362\n2,185\n1,629\n548\nTrade receivables are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured less any provision for impairment in relation to expected credit losses. At each reporting date the Group assesses the expected credit losses and changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the receivable and a provision for impairment is recognised when considered necessary. The Group considers the ageing to be reasonable and has no history of significant bad debts. No provisions have been made in in these financial statements. The Board do not consider the credit risk to be significant for the financial assets currently held.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. The Group's policy is, where possible, to allow Group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their functional (currency). Where Group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them), cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere within the Group.\nThe Group's main exposure to foreign currency risk is on the trade receivables in the Portuguese subsidiary which are not held in Euros. The Directors have considered the balances at year end and based on the level of foreign currency balances and the expected timing of settlement of those amounts that the foreign exchange risk is not material.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that ITIM Group may encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with the financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance that is designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.\nThe Group would normally expect that sufficient cash is generated in the operating cycle to meet the contractual cash flows through effective cash management.

The Group also aims to optimise its capital structure of debt and equity so as to minimise its cost of capital. The Group in particular reviews its levels of borrowing and the repayment dates, setting these out against forecast cash flows and reviewing the level of available funds.\n21.\nShare capital\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n2023\n\u00a3'000\nAuthorised:\n37,949,651 Ordinary shares of 5p each\n1,898\n1,898\n1,898\n1,898\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n2023\n\u00a3'000\nAllotted, called up and fully paid:\n31,210,607 Ordinary shares of 5p each\n1,561\n1,561\n1,561\n1,561\nA summary of the rights of the different classes of share is given below:\nVoting\nAll Ordinary shares are entitled to one vote each.

Options are granted with a fixed exercise price. The vesting period varies from vesting immediately to vesting over 2 years from the date of grant.

Pursuant to the Company's Articles of Association, a member of the Company entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by this notice is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at that meeting on his behalf.\n2. If a member appoints more than one proxy, each proxy must be entitled to exercise the rights attached to different shares. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same shares, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.\n3. A proxy may only be appointed using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the form of proxy. To validly appoint a proxy, a member must complete, sign and date the enclosed form of proxy and deposit it at the office of the Company's registrars, Neville Registrars, at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen, West Midlands B62 8HD, by 10.30 a.m. on 11 June 2025 (or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, not less than 48 hours, excluding non-working days, before the time fixed for the holding of the adjourned meeting). Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the form of proxy is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be enclosed with the form of proxy.\n4. In order to revoke a proxy appointment, a member must sign and date a notice clearly stating his intention to revoke his proxy appointment and deposit it at the office of the Company's registrars, Neville Registrars, at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen, West Midlands B62 8HD prior to commencement of the meeting. If the revocation is received after the time specified, the original proxy appointment will remain valid unless the member attends the meeting and votes in person.\n5. Pursuant to the Articles of Association, any corporation which is a member of the Company may authorise one or more persons (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend, speak and vote at the meeting as the representative of that corporation. A certified copy of the board resolution of the corporation appointing the relevant person as the representative of that corporation in connection with the meeting must be deposited at the office of the Company's registrars, Neville Registrars, at Neville House, Steelpark Road, Halesowen, West Midlands B62 8HD prior to the commencement of the meeting. If the revocation is received after the time specified, the original corporate representative appointment will remain valid unless the member attends the meeting and votes in person.\n6. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy in respect of the same shares, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first named being the most senior).\n7. The right to vote at the meeting shall be determined by reference to the register of members of the Company. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended), only those persons whose names are entered on the register of members of the Company at 6.00 p.m. on 11 June 2025 (or, in the event of any adjournment, at 6.00 p.m. on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. Changes to entries on the register of members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to vote at the meeting.\n8. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via\nwww.euroclear.com\n). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.\n9. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a \"\nCREST Proxy Instruction\n\") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (\"\nEuroclear\n\") specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's agent (ID 7RA11) by the latest time for proxy appointments set out in paragraph 3 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.\n10. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).\n11. As at 12th May 2025, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this notice, the Company's issued share capital consisted of 31,415,607 ordinary shares of \u00a30.05 each, carrying one vote each and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 12th May 2025 were 31,415,607.\n12. You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of section 333(4) of the Companies Act 2006) provided in this notice or in any related documents (including the form of proxy and the annual report and accounts) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.\n13. Your personal data includes all data provided by you, or on your behalf, which related to you as a shareholder, including your name and contact details, the votes you cast and your reference number (as attributed to you by the Company or its registrars). The Company determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, your personal data is to be processed. The Company and any third party to which it discloses the data (including the Company's registrars) may process your personal data for the purposes of compiling and updating the Company's records, fulfilling its legal obligations and processing the shareholder rights you exercise.\nEXPLANATORY NOTES:\nResolutions 1 to 5 (inclusive) are proposed as ordinary resolutions. For each of these to be passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the relevant resolution.\nResolutions 6 and 7 are proposed as special resolutions. For each of these resolutions to be passed, at least three quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. An explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below:\nResolution 1 - Annual Report and Accounts\nThe Directors are required to present to the annual general meeting the audited accounts and the Directors' and Auditors' Reports for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.\nResolution 2 - Auditors\nThe Company is required to appoint an auditor at every general meeting of the Company at which accounts are presented to shareholders. The appointment of RPG Crouch Chapman LLP. Accordingly, this resolution proposes the re-appointment of RPG Crouch Chapman LLP as the auditors of the Company. It is normal practice for a company's directors to be authorised to agree how much the auditors should be paid and Resolution 2 grants this authority to the directors.\nResolutions 3 to 4 - Re-election of Directors\nArticle 77 of the Company's articles of association requires any directors who have been appointed by the Board since the last annual general meeting and any directors who were not appointed or reappointed at one of the preceding two annual general meetings to retire from office. Any such director is entitled to offer himself for re-election.\nResolutions 5 and 6 - Directors' general power to allot relevant securities\nResolution 5 is proposed to renew the directors' power to allot shares.\nResolution 5 seeks to grant the directors authority to allot, pursuant to section 551 of the Act, shares or grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company up an aggregate nominal value of \u00a3523,593 which is equal to one third of the nominal value of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 12 May 2025 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice). Unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, the authorities sought under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2026 or 13 September 2026 (whichever is the earlier). The Directors have no present intention of exercising either of the authorities under this resolution, but the Board wishes to ensure that the Company has maximum flexibility in managing the financial resources of the Company. As at the date of this notice, no shares are held by the Company in treasury.\nResolution 6 is to approve the partial disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of the allotment of equity securities for cash. The passing of this resolution (together with resolution 5) would allow the directors to allot shares for cash and/or sell treasury shares without first having to offer such shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. The authority would be limited to allotments or sales up to an aggregate nominal amount of \u00a378,539 which represents approximately 5 per cent. of the nominal value of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 12 May 2025 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice). Unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, the authorities sought under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company next annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2026 or 13 September 2026 (whichever is the earlier).\nResolution 7 - Authority for the market purchase by the Company of its own shares\nThe authority sought by resolution 7 limits the number of shares that could be purchased to a maximum of 3,141,560 ordinary shares (equivalent to 10 per cent. of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at 12 May 2025 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice)) and sets a minimum and maximum price. Unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, the authority will expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2026 or 13 September 2026 (whichever is the earlier). The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company's ordinary shares but will keep the matter under review, taking into account the financial resources of the Company, the Company's share price and future funding opportunities. The Directors will exercise this authority only when to do so would be in the best interests of the Company and of its shareholders generally, and could be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share of the Company. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchase through the London Stock Exchange plc. Any shares the Company buys under this authority may either be cancelled or held in treasury. Treasury shares can be re-sold for cash, cancelled or used for the purposes of employee share schemes. No dividends are paid on shares whilst held in treasury and no voting rights attach to treasury shares. The Directors believe that it is desirable for the Company to have this choice as holding the purchased shares as treasury shares would give the Company the ability to re-sell or transfer them in the future and so provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
