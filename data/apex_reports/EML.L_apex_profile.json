General information\nEmmerson PLC (the \"Company\") is a company incorporated and domiciled in the Isle of Man, whose shares have since 27 April 2021 been listed on AIM.\nThe principal activities of the Group are the pursuance of a dispute with the Moroccan Government regarding the Khemisset Potash project, and the development of the Company's proprietary potash processing technology known as KMP. In previous years, the principal activity was the development of the Khemisset Potash project, however the rejection of the Company's environmental permit application in October 2024, resulting in the total expropriation of the Project, necessitated a change in strategy.\n2. Basis of preparation\n2.1 General\nThe Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the valuation and recognition principles of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the Group's auditor, and do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements.\nThey should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unchanged from those disclosed in those statements. These policies have been consistently applied to each of the periods presented.\nThe financial information of the Group is presented in US Dollars, which is also the functional currency of the parent Company and has been prepared under the historical cost convention. The individual financial statements of each of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency).\n2.2 Basis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, Moroccan Salts Limited (\"MSL\"), Potasse de Khemisset SA, Mines de Centre SARL, and Khemisset UK Ltd (\"KUL\").\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\nGenerally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\u00b7\nThe contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;\n\u00b7\nRights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nThe Group's voting rights and potential voting rights.\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Group Financial Statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\nAll intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets, are eliminated in full.\nAll the Group's companies have 31 December as their year-end. Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions.\n2.3 Functional and presentational currency\nThe financial information of the Group is presented in US Dollars, which is also the functional currency of the parent Company, and has been prepared under the historical cost convention. The individual financial statements of each of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency).\n2.4 Going concern\nAs at 18 September 2025 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$1.1 million. On 2 January 2025, the Company signed a Capital Provision Agreement (\"CPA\") with a specialist litigation funding firm to provide up to US$11.0 million in both litigation finance capital and working capital for the Company.\nThe Company has prepared a cashflow forecast to December 2026 setting out the expected financial commitments related to the running of the Group in its reduced scale, and the legal and other advisory expenses related to the ongoing dispute with the Moroccan government. The Company will not commit to further material financial obligations for at least the 12 months from the date of this report in order to protect its Going Concern position.\nBased on a review of the cashflow forecast, the Board is satisfied that the existing cash and funding facility are more than sufficient to meet the Company's outgoings for at least 12 months from the date of this report, and therefore believe the Going Concern basis is appropriate for the preparation of the financial statements.\n3. Administrative fee and other expenses\nUS$'000\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2025\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2024\n12 months to\n31 Dec 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nDirectors' fees\n380\n296\n599\nDepreciation\n-\n5\n16\nTravel\nand accommodation\n3\n6\n2\nAuditors' remuneration\n18\n37\n63\nEmployment costs\n19\n425\n702\nProfessional and consultancy fees\n289\n565\n1,055\nOther expenses\n227\n162\n2,001\nTotal Administrative Expenses\n936\n1,496\n4,438\n4. Litigation funding\nOn 2 January 2025, the Company announced that it had signed a Capital Provision Agreement (\"CPA\") with a specialist litigation funding firm to provide up to US$11.0 million in both litigation finance capital and working capital for the Company (the \"Funding\"). Funds advanced under the CPA can be used to settle legal fees connected with the case, as well as for general working capital purposes, subject to approvals.\nFunds advanced are non-recourse and are not repayable in the event of the legal case being lost. If the case has a successful outcome, the litigation funding firm will receive capital a capital entitlement based on multiples of the amounts advanced, or a percentage of the total settlement, depending on the timing and quantum of the settlement.\nBecause the funds advanced confer present benefits whose value can be quantified, these advances are recognised as Other Income. The balance of entitlements under the CPA will be recognised upon settlement of the legal case, as a reduction against the final award.\nDuring the period, the Company incurred litigation expenses of US$1,004k, of which US$727k were settled through advances and has been recognised as Other Income. The balance of US$277k has been recorded as a Current Liability.\n5. Current and Non-current liabilities\nOn 30 April 2025, the Company reached a legal settlement agreement related to a contract dated 29 November 2021 relating to the provision of basic engineering package for the Company's Khemisset Potash Project. The settlement amount agreed between both parties is US$427k, payable in 3 instalments with the final payment due on 27 May 2027. This amount has been split between current and non-current liabilities accordingly.\n6. Earnings per share\nThe calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:\nUS$'000\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2025\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2024\n12 months to\n31 Dec 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nEarnings\nLoss from continuing operations for the period attributable to the equity holders of the Company\n(1,290)\n(1,596)\n(25,770)\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share\n1,293,070,615\n1,052,292,157\n1,111,428,463\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n0.10 cents\n0.15 cents\n2,32 cents\n7. Intangible assets\nThe intangible assets consist of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure, including the cost of acquiring the mining license and research permits held by the Company's subsidiaries.\n30 Jun 2025\n30 Jun 2024\n31 Dec 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nCost:\nAt the beginning of the period\n-\n20,457\n20,457\nAdditions\n-\n216\n201\n-\n(20,353)\nExchange differences\n-\n(25)\n(305)\nAs at end of period\n-\n20,648\n-\nDuring the period ended 31 December 2024, the Company fully impaired the capitalised exploration and evaluation costs in respect of the Khemisset project, following the rejection of the ESIA in October 2024.\n8. Related party transactions\nDirectors' consultancy fees\nGraham Clarke is a Director of the Company and also provides consulting services to the Company. During the period, Graham Clarke received fees of US$150k (H1 2024: nil). The amount outstanding as at the period end was US$ nil (31 Dec 2024: US$ nil).\nRobert Wrixon is a Director of the Company and also provides consulting services to the Company.

The ICSID Secretary-General registered the RFA on 23 May 2025.\nThe Claimants seek\ncompensation for the loss and damage they sustained as a result of Morocco's breaches of its obligations under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\"), including (i) Morocco's expropriation of the Project in violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT, and (ii) Morocco's breach of its obligations to accord the Claimants fair and equitable treatment, to provide full protection and security to the Claimants and their investments, and to refrain from impairing the Claimants' investments by discriminatory measures under Article 2(2) of the BIT.\nThe Claimants will quantify the amount of compensation sought during the course of the arbitral proceedings, taking into account that the Company's most recent valuation of the Project was approximately US$ 2.2 billion.\nOn 5 August 2025, Stanimir A. Alexandrov (a Bulgarian national) accepted his appointment by the Claimants as arbitrator. On 15 August 2025, Zachary Douglas KC, a national of Australia and Switzerland, accepted his appointment by the Respondent as arbitrator.

Hard copies will be posted to the Company's shareholders.\n2024 Highlights:\n\u00b7\nA Scoping Study on the Khemisset Multi-mineral Process was completed at the beginning of 2024 with subsequent test work to optimise high value products and re-calculate the mineral resource accordingly.\n\u00b7\nDespite addressing the environmental concerns previously raised, the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment which had been submitted to the Commission R\u00e9gionale Unifi\u00e9e d'Investissement following referral from the Ministerial Committee resulted in another unfavourable recommendation.\n\u00b7\nIn early November 2024, the Company announced that it had informed the Government of The Kingdom of Morocco that there was an investment dispute between the Company and the Government.\n\u00b7\nThe Company appointed Boies Schiller Flexner LLP as its legal counsel.\n\u00b7\nFunds raised in December 2024 provided gross proceeds of US$1.1 million\nto provide sufficient time for the Company to secure litigation funding and to cover corporate costs.\n\u00b7\nThe 2024 results include an impairment of the Khemisset asset of US$21.1 million, and an overall loss after tax for the year of US$25.7 million.\n\u00b7\nCompany overheads have been reduced significantly to conserve cash pending legal proceedings.\n2025 Updates:\n\u00b7\nOn 2 January 2025 Emmerson announced it had signed a Capital Provision Agreement with a specialist litigation funding firm to provide up to US$11,000,000 in both litigation finance capital and working capital for the Company and confirmed Boies Schiller Flexner LLP as its legal counsel.\n\u00b7\nOn 1 May 2025 Emmerson provided an update on the dispute with the Kingdom of Morocco:\no\nA Request for Arbitration was submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.\no\nEmmerson is bringing a claim for full compensation in respect of the Khemisset Potash Project, which it has valued internally at US$2.2 billion.\n\u00b7\nThe clear priority for 2025 is to work with our legal advisors and proceed with the legal process with regard to the arbitration.\nGraham Clarke, CEO, commented:\n\"\nThe rejection of our ESIA during the year was extremely disappointing and we have initiated arbitration proceedings against the Kingdom of Morocco. This is now the Company's primary focus, and we are confident of a successful outcome. In the meantime, we are also exploring ways to valorise our proprietary potash processing methodology, known as the KMP, while remaining focused on minimising expenditure. We will provide updates on the progress of our activities during 2025\n\".\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nominated Advisor and Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Will King\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014.\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT\n2024 started positively with the announcement of the Khemisset Multi-mineral Process (\"KMP\") and progress with the environmental approval, as this was successfully referred back to the\nCentre R\u00e9gional d'Investissement\n(\"CRI\") for review following the appeal to the Ministerial Committee. However, in spite of the Company`s best efforts, the innovation of the Khemisset Multi-mineral Process, interaction with the relevant authorities and the addressing of the environmental issues previously raised, the Company received a second unfavourable outcome in regard to the approval of the environmental licence in October 2024. Following legal advice and a review of the options open to the Company, the decision was taken at the beginning of November to inform the Government of The Kingdom of Morocco that there was an investment dispute between the Company and the Government. The Company appointed Boies Schiller Flexner LLP as its litigation counsel and commenced investigating routes for litigation funding.\nThe ESIA and Litigation\nThe primary focus for the Company at the beginning of 2024 was to obtain the approval of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (\"ESIA\")\n.\nThe Company, having sent an appeal to the Ministerial Committee in 2023 was still awaiting progress at the beginning of the 2024 financial year. The Committee was unable to sit before late January 2024; government priorities were impacted in the intervening period by more pressing matters such as the tragic earthquake in September 2023.\nDuring January 2024, the Company anno",

In due course, the Company will make further announcements concerning the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, the filing of written submissions, including a substantiated damages figure, and the evidentiary hearing, which the Company understands will take approximately two years from the submission of the RFA.\nGraham Clarke, Managing Director of Emmerson PLC commented:\n\"The completion and lodgement of the RFA with ICSID is a significant step and marks the formal commencement of the litigation process. The Company is working closely with our lawyers at BSF and as a group we remain confident in the merits of this case.

The Company has also put a Management Incentive Plan into place.\nLitigation funding\nThe Funding shall primarily be used to progress the Company's dispute with the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 14 February 2002, being a Bilateral Investment Treaty (the \"BIT\").\nEmmerson's CPA funding counterparty (the \"Funding Party\") is one of the world's largest and most successful litigation finance companies and a significant\ninstitution within the legal financing industry. The detailed terms of the CPA are confidential but, in summary:\n\u00b7\nUp to US$11,000,000 can be drawn down in tranches, at the Company's request, to satisfy litigation funding requirements and for general working capital purposes;\n\u00b7\nThe Funding shall be provided on a non-recourse basis and the Funding Party shall receive no return if the arbitration claim is unsuccessful; and\n\u00b7\nIn the case of a successful settlement or award, the return to the Funding Party shall be based upon the greater of a multiple of the final drawn-down amount or a percentage of the final award.\nThe Company notes that it has obtained litigation funding for its potential arbitration proceedings under the BIT within two months from the original Notification of Dispute, a process that can typically take six to nine months, oftentimes longer. The Company is of the opinion that the Funding will provide the platform to provide the best long-term return for shareholders.\nLitigation Counsel\nThe Company has confirmed the appointment of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (\"BSF\") as its litigation counsel. BSF have a highly successful track record in similar BIT arbitration cases, including some recent high-profile awards. The funding is now in place for BSF to commence work in the New Year on our case.\nManagement Incentive Plan (MIP)\nTo retain the services of certain Directors and members of the Company's management team who are important to the Company's ongoing management and the progress of the litigation, and who have important historical information and knowledge to contribute towards the litigation, the Company has established a long-term Management Incentive Program (the \"MIP\").

The Company has engaged Boies Schiller Flexner LLP as its litigation counsel and is examining various funding avenues for an investment dispute.\nThe dispute arises out of various breaches, by the Government and its Agents, of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was signed on 30 October 1990 and entered into force on 14 February 2002 (the \"BIT\").\nThe BIT provides that Emmerson may submit its dispute for settlement by arbitration to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\").\nThere is no requirement under the BIT to notify Morocco of Emmerson's intention to submit a claim to arbitration and therefore, the Company has no obligation to wait for any specific period of time before commencing arbitration.\nNevertheless, before proceeding to arbitration, Emmerson has, in good faith and in the spirit of cooperation, invited Morocco to engage in discussions regarding cash compensation for the damages incurred because of Morocco's breaches of the BIT, with a view to achieving an amicable resolution of the dispute.\nIf such discussions with Morocco are unsuccessful, Emmerson intends to submit a claim for arbitration under the BIT, seeking damages for the harm described above, plus interest, costs, and any such further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances.\nThe Company remains hopeful that its dispute with the Government can be resolved amicably. The Company will consider any and all other actions necessary to ensure its rights are preserved.\nEmmerson has always conducted its business in Morocco to the highest environmental and ethical standards, often well in excess of the local regulatory requirements, adhering strictly to local laws. The Khemisset Potash Project is one of the most strategically valuable fertiliser assets on the African Continent, especially for Morocco, which currently imports significant quantities of potash to its global fertiliser company, OCP.\nWith the implementation of its proprietary (and patent pending) KMP design, the Company was targeting the production of potash alongside several complementary fertiliser products that would have employed the lowest water usage of any potash mine globally, with the elimination of waste brines entirely, in order to create the world's most environmentally sustainable potash mine.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\nAbout Boies Schiller Flexner LLP\nBoies Schiller Flexner is a firm of internationally recognized trial lawyers, crisis managers, and strategic advisers known for its creative and efficient pursuit of successful outcomes for its clients. Boies Schiller Flexner has served as lead counsel in multiple arbitrations in the mining industry including the recent favourable awards for GreenX Metals in its arbitration with Poland and subsidiaries of Indiana Resources in its dispute with Tanzania.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Hayden Locke\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Matthew Hogg\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nNotes to Editors\nEmmerson is focused on advancing the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or the \"Project\") in Morocco into a low cost, high margin supplier of potash, and the first primary producer on the African continent.

As a result, the Company has implemented a comprehensive review to significantly reduce its cash burn rate while it assesses its strategic and appeal options with respect to the recent unfavourable recommendation.\nIn addition to the streamlining of the Board, from 1 November 2024, the two remaining non-executive directors (Mr Locke and Mr Wrixon) will suspend taking their cash fees and will, instead, take fees in the form of shares to continue to align them with the interests of other shareholders.\nGraham Clarke, the Managing Director and CEO, will reduce his base cash compensation by 40%, which will be reviewed on an ongoing quarterly basis with respect to the Company's financial position and ongoing prospects. Mr Clarke will also take a portion of the reduction in shares.\nThe majority of the remaining ongoing costs within the business, with the exception of core administrative and regulatory functions, are being reviewed and will be significantly reduced. Unfortunately, this will mean, for the time being, that virtually no further progress can be made on the various value-adding project development workstreams underway.\nHayden Locke, in-coming Chairman of Emmerson, commented:\n\"\nI would like to thank both James and Rupert for their wise counsel and commitment to Emmerson during what has been a very challenging period for the Company. Both are disappointed with the outcome and are reticent to leave at this important juncture, but they also recognise a restructuring is necessary to preserve optionality for the Company, and any remaining potential for value for our stakeholders.\n\"Thank you to Graham for his continued commitment to the Company, taking a significant reduction in remuneration while continuing to work incredibly hard as we assess our options. Many investors mistake silence for lack of activity but, in our current situation, it is difficult to make appropriate and conclusive statements when we have no clarity on our position, without prejudicing our potential future options.\n\"Graham, Rob and I are working hard to assess our next steps, and I look forward to updating the market when our path becomes clear.\n\"We thank our remaining shareholders for their patience.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Charles Vaughan\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Matthew Hogg\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nShard Capital (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\n+44 (0)20 7186 9927\nBlytheRay (Financial PR and IR)\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray / Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNotes to Editors\nEmmerson is focused on advancing the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or the \"Project\") in Morocco into a low cost, high margin supplier of potash, and the first primary producer on the African continent.

The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects.

In April 2024, the Company completed these updates and resubmitted what it expects to be the final version of the ESIA.\nDuring Q3, the Company continued to engage with the relevant Moroccan authorities to ensure there is acceptance that all technical issues previously raised by the authorities, mainly around preservation of water resources, have now been properly addressed prior to a final examination by the CRUI.\nIt is now understood that the approval process is reaching its conclusion, and the Company hopes to be able to announce the outcome, which it is confident will be positive, during this quarter.\nCrop trials\nAfter the successful completion of the first crop trials, a second round of agronomic trials looking at how effective the KMP products are at providing phosphates to lettuces was completed in September. Final laboratory results are expected in the coming weeks, but visual indications are that the new products perform in line with traditional phosphate sources, and considerably better than controls with no phosphate provided.\nThese trials are important to confirm the large body of research into struvite and vivianite. First and foremost, farmers require the products to provide phosphates for their crops. However, the KMP products also offer the additional advantages of being multi-nutrient and slow-release, allowing for lower usage rates and counteracting the negative environmental effects of phosphate run-off, which sets them apart as a higher-value product.\nOther KMP upsides\nAlthough the KMP enhancements arose from investigations to address brine management, the economic benefits of the new products (struvite and vivianite) have transformed the value of the Project compared with the original design (more than doubling the NPV8 to US$2.2 billion as announced in February 2024).\nThis increase was based on the economic contribution of the new products, but the KMP offers further benefits over and above those included in the February 2024 estimates. In particular, the Company has begun work on a revised Resource, as the improvements in recovery of potash and the ability to monetise the other micro-nutrients previously considered waste elements should allow a considerable increase in economically extractable ore. An updated JORC Mineral Resource Estimate is targeted to be announced during Q4 2024.\nAs well as increasing the size of the Resource (and extending the mine life), the KMP offers the potential to re-visit the mine sequencing, as areas high in magnesium and iron, which were previously considered deleterious elements, could be more profitable than pure potash zones, allowing the mine plan to be fundamentally reworked and improved. This work will follow once the Resource update has been confirmed.\nIn addition, the KMP process changes will mean that a portion of the salt produced as a by-product will be at industrial grade, which is more valuable than de-icing salt, and commands a higher price. This will provide an additional revenue stream for minimal marginal cost, and will also reduce further the quantity of salt to be disposed on the dry tailings.\nFurther value-adding optimisations enabled by the KMP are also being considered, although some of these may form modular enhancements later in the project. The overall impact of the KMP on Khemisset cannot be overstated, from an environmental or economic perspective, and will undoubtedly make the Project more",

The overall environmental credentials of the Project are now even more robust, and, together with the compelling economics of the KMP update, should mean that we can obtain the necessary approvals and move forward with the Project swiftly.\n\"While we have been holding back from any major workstreams pending timing clarification of the ESIA approval process, we have nevertheless made some important steps forward on the new KMP products to be marketed.\n\"The crop trials, which were completed in June, confirmed the effectiveness of the new KMP fertiliser products as sources of phosphate and will be followed up with further trials looking at the benefits of the other micronutrients (magnesium and iron) they contain, as well as their slow-release properties. We have also signed MOUs for the offtake of a significant quantity of the new KMP products, confirming the marketability of these multi-nutrient fertilisers.\n\"\nEnvironmental Approval\nIn March 2024, the\nCommission Minist\u00e9rielle de Pilotage\n(The \"Ministerial Committee\") invited the Company to update its ESIA to incorporate the optimisations arising from the KMP process changes, which include a significant reduction in water consumption and the elimination of the need to dispose of waste brines, and to resubmit this for review by the CRUI.\nIn April 2024, the Company completed these updates and resubmitted what it hopes to be the last version of the ESIA.\nThe Company continues to pursue its engagement with the relevant authorities, and in view of the considerable improvements to the environmental footprint of the Project made not only through the KMP enhancements, but also other enhancements over the previous three years, the Company remains confident that the approval will be forthcoming.\nCrop trials\nIn June 2024,\nthe Company\ncompleted the first set of crop trials using two multi-nutrient fertilisers produced from the new KMP optimisations. The\ntrials, which took place over a\n10-week period with little gem lettuces in a glass-house test environment, assessed the suitability of struvite and vivianite products as sources of phosphate.\nThe results were positive as had been expected, as plants fed with both products performed in line with those given traditional phosphate sources, and considerably better than controls given no phosphate.\nFurther trials are planned to assess the additional benefits from the other nutrients contained by the KMP products (magnesium, iron and nitrogen), as well as the benefit of being slow-release, on various crops and for different soil types, with a view to increasing their market value.\nOfftake for KMP products\nIn June 2024, the Company entered into a non-binding MOU with Hexagon Group AG (\"Hexagon\") for offtake of some of the new fertiliser products resulting from KMP.\nUnder the terms of the MOU, Hexagon would take up to 300,000 metric tonnes of struvite-based products and 50,000 tonnes per annum of vivianite-based products\nAll other terms of the MOU are in line with the MOUs for potash and salt announced in November 2022, including \"take or pay\" provisions, and will be delivered Free On Board (\"FOB\") at Casablanca, Jorf Lasfar, or Safi (unless otherwise mutually agreed).\nThis MOU is also non-exclusive, meaning\nthe Company\ncan continue to engage in ongoing offtake discussions with other wholesale customers, distributors, and global traders for production from Khemisset for all o",

With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. Updated financial estimates published in February 2024 indicated a net present value of US$2.2 billion, with an internal rate of return of approximately 40%.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As previously announced, this enhancement reduces the Khemisset Project's environmental impact by cutting water consumption by 50% and by eliminating the need to dispose of brines (as well as transforming the economics of the project).\n\"\nWe updated our environmental assessment to incorporate these optimisations and submitted the document during April 2024.

Whilst we have not yet received this critical approval, Graham and his team have used this extended period of time constructively, most notably with the development of the innovative Khemisset Multi-mineral Process (\"KMP\"). It is my belief that this will be seen as a seminal period for the Company, once the true environmental, commercial, and financial benefits of KMP are more widely recognised.\nIn early April 2024, we submitted the latest, and we hope final, version of the ESIA to the\nCommission R\u00e9gionale Unifi\u00e9e de l'Investissement\n(the \"CRUI\"), the body responsible for granting environmental approval.\nWe very much hope that we are now at the final ",

In addition, the Company will shortly launch a retail offer to existing shareholders on the REX platform.\nQ1 2024 update\nEnvironmental approval\nOn 11 March 2024, the Company announced that the\nCommission Minist\u00e9rielle de Pilotage\n(\"Ministerial Committee\" or the \"Committee\"), to whom the Company referred the decision of the\nCommission R\u00e9gionale Unifi\u00e9e d'Investissement\n(\"\nCRUI\n\") regarding the Project's environmental approval in July 2023, had upheld the Company's referral and asked that the matter be returned to the CRUI for reconsideration.\nAs part of this, the Committee invited the Company to resubmit an Environmental Impact Assessment (\"\nEIA\n\"), including any environmental optimisations. The Company and its consultants have therefore been preparing a revised EIA to address the concerns previously raised by the CRUI including the improvements arising from the Khemisset Multi-mineral Process (\"\nKMP\n\"), and this document will be submitted in the coming days.\nThe Company believes that the improvements resulting from the incorporation of the KMP into the design, notably the reduction in water consumption and the elimination of brine disposal, are considerable, and address the major concerns related to water identified by the CRUI. Whilst the Company considers that its previous EIA was adequate and met all relevant criteria required by the CRUI and other relevant authorities, it is excited to introduce its new proprietary KMP technology into the development of the Project.\nThe CRUI is expected to review the EIA submission, particularly focusing on the amendments, over the coming weeks, and any updates will be announced in due course.\nKMP\nOn 1 February 2024, the Company announced that it had completed a scoping study on a new processing route known as KMP. Full details of the benefits of KMP can be found in the announcement from that date which is available\nhere\n.\nUS$2.175 million subscription with GSM and GQC\nEmmerson is pleased to announce that it has entered into a subscription agreement with Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd (\"\nGSM\n\") and Gold Quay Capital Pte Ltd (\"\nGQC\n\")\n(together the \"\nStrategic Investors\n\"), whereby GSM will subscribe for US$2.0 million of new Shares and GQC will subscribe for US$175k of new Shares, at a placing price of 1.75 pence\nper Share (the\n\"Placing Price\n\")\n. The Placing Price represents a discount of 16.4% to the Company's 5-day VWAP of 2.09 pence.\nPursuant to legally binding subscription agreements, GSM has subscribed for 90,702,948 Shares and GQC has subscribed for 7,936,508 Shares at the Placing Price (the \"\nSubscriptions\n\"). On completion of the Subscriptions, GSM and GQC will be beneficially interested in 20.30% and 2.64% respectively of the Company's issued share capital.\nIn addition, the Strategic Investors will receive a warrant to subscribe for new Shares (\"\nWarrants\n\") for each Share subscribed for pursuant to the Subscription Agreements. The Warrants have an exercise price of 3 pence and an expiry date of 31 December 2024.\nGSM Board Seat\nOn completion of the Subscriptions, and as a result of its shareholding exceeding 20%, GSM will have the right to appoint a representative to Emmerson's board of directors, under the terms of the relationship agreement signed in November 2021 between the Company and GSM. GSM have indicated to Emmerson that they intend to exercise this right and details of any appointment, which will be subject to the usual regulatory approvals, will be announced in due course.\nUse of proceeds\nThe funds will be utilized by the Company to advance its studies in respect of KMP towards feasibility level alongside the progression of the EIA process in Morocco, as well as for general working capital requirements.\nRetail Offer on REX platform\nTo enable the Company's existing shareholders to participate at the same Placing Price, the Company intends to make an offer of Shares at a price of 1.75 pence per Share available on the\u00a0REX platform (the\u00a0\"\nRetail\u00a0Offer\n\"). The Retail Offer will be the subject of a separate announcement to be made shortly.\nGraham Clarke, CEO of Emmerson commented:\n\"\nFollowing the news last month that the Ministerial Committee had upheld the referral of our environmental approval, we have been working to update the EIA to incorporate the various improvements that the KMP has enabled.

With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Company currently has a patent pending\nFinancial Updates\n\u00b7\nFinancial estimates for the Project updated from the feasibility study announced in June 2020 (the \"2020 Feasibility Study\"), both for the production process as originally designed (\"Original Design\"), and incorporating the KMP (the Project, including the KMP, being the \"KMP Process Solution\")\n\u00b7\nKMP substantially improves the Project economics:\no\nPost-tax NPV8 of US$2.2 billion (Original Design without KMP updated to NPV8 US$1.0 billion)\no\nPost-tax IRR of 40% (Original Design IRR updated to 26%)\no\nAnnual EBITDA US$440 million per annum (Original Design US$258 million)\n\u00b7\nTotal Project capex (incorporating KMP) now estimated to be US$525 million (Original Design capex US$539 million), reflecting industry-wide cost inflation since 2020\n\u00b7\nAll-in sustaining cost of US$163 per tonne (\"/t\") positions the Project at the lower end of the cost curve and delivers robust returns across a range of potash price assumptions\nEnvironmental Approval\n\u00b7\nThe Company is still awaiting notification from the\nCommission Minist\u00e9rielle de Pilotage\n(''Ministerial Committee'' or the ''Committee''), to whom the Khemisset environmental approval was referred in July 2023\nChief Executive Officer, Graham Clarke, said:\n\"The Khemisset Multi-mineral Process is an exciting, innovative development that represents a major improvement both environmentally and economically.\n\"The KMP arose from our team continuously exploring ways to minimise impact on the environment, particularly when it comes to water; we are always striving to protect this critical resource. It also forms part of the optimisation work that we had committed to do in discussions with water authorities in H1 2023. The KMP addresses these issues, while also delivering significant economic upside through the production of new fertiliser products to complement Khemisset's potash.\n\"The KMP transforms the environmental credentials of the Project by eliminating the requirement for the disposal of brines through DWI and significantly reducing process water consumption, both important points for the Moroccan authorities and local communities. We believe it further strengthens the case for approving our Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (\"ESIA\").\n\"Struvite and vivianite are multi-nutrient fertilisers containing phosphate, nitrogen, magnesium, and iron respectively. Their lower solubility means the nutrients are released over a longer period, and are less prone to being washed away by rain. This means that application rates can be less frequent, and phosphate run-offs that cause eutrophication of streams and lakes are significantly reduced.\n\"As part of our Scoping Study, we have updated our economic estimates for the Project, both based on the Original Design and the new KMP. Cost inflation since 2020 has inevitably resulted in an increase in capex of approximately 31% for the Original Design. In the case of the KMP, the elimination of DWI reduces this increase to 28%.\n\"More significantly, the addition of new revenue sources delivers considerable economic benefits, with the IRR of 40% for the Project including the KMP considerably higher than most potash projects in development.\n\"The ",

This Committee was unable to meet during the second half of 2023. The Company understands that this was a result of a number of matters taking priority at governmental level, not least the co-ordination of relief efforts related to the earthquake in September 2023.\nThe Company continues to lobby to ensure this meeting takes place as soon as possible, and that its application will be considered favourably, while at all times respecting due protocols and procedures.\nThe Company has repeatedly been assured that the meeting will take place soon, and that no further significant issues remain. However, the timing of the meeting and its outcomes are not within the Company's control. Any substantive updates on the approval process will be reported without delay.\nBank Mandates\nIn December 2023, the Company announced the extension of the appointment of a syndicate of leading international and Moroccan banks as initial mandated lead arrangers (\"MLAs\") to co-ordinate and fund dual-tranche debt financing facilities for the development of the Project for a further 12 months until 31 December 2024.\nThe debt facility under discussion amounts to US$310 million, including an ECA-covered tranche of US$230 million supported by UK Export Finance, and a dual currency (US$ and Moroccan Dirham) commercial tranche of\u00a0US$80 million.\nThe extension of the mandates demonstrates the ongoing support for the Khemisset Project by the syndicate.\nOther Workstreams\nThe basic engineering workstreams for the Khemisset Project are now at the stage where only the final documents are expected. No further exploration or engineering work in respect of the basic design is being undertaken pending the ESIA approval.\nSeparately, the Company has continued to examine process design and optimisations with a specific focus on improving the Project's environmental footprint, which also offer considerable economic upside. Details of these enhancements are being finalised and will be announced in due course.\nChief Executive Graham Clarke\nsaid:\n\"\nThe final quarter of 2023 has been frustrating in that we continue to await the session of the Ministerial Committee, which is the next step towards the approval of our environmental permit. Discussions with various parties and advisors have continued to be positive, offering understanding for our frustration while explaining that governmental attention has been focused on various other matters. We believe the matter will be dealt with soon, based on feedback, but we are unable to provide any confirmed dates as the matter is in the hands of the government.\n\"The extension of the bank mandates was a positive development, and a reminder of the fact that we continue to enjoy the support of international and Moroccan banks, the UK government (both through UK Export Finance and the work of the British Embassy in Rabat), and our largest shareholder Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd.\n\"While we have been continuing with our lobbying activities, we have limited our technical activities appropriately in order to preserve the Company's cash for as long as possible, although some important work has been undertaken to examine opportunities for further optimising and enhancing the project economically and more importantly, environmentally.\n\"Once we have the ESIA approval, we will be in a position to move forward quickly with fundraising and technical work. We will of course provide updates as soon as we are able in all these matters.\n\"In the meantime, I am grateful to our shareholders for their continued support, particularly in the context of unforgiving market conditions.\n\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Jim Wynn / Charles Vaughan\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nLiberum Capital Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Matthew Hogg / Kan",

Cash reserves of US$3.5 million as at the time of this report.\nActivities During the Period\nThe Company's priority during the Period was advancing discussions with government officials towards obtaining environmental approval for the Khemisset Project in Morocco. Currently, Emmerson is awaiting a session of the Ministerial Committee to consider the matter, and although management remains confident of a favourable outcome based on discussions to date, the timing of the meeting is not certain, particularly following the devastating earthquake in Morocco, which has, understandably, been the main focus of government attention.\nFinancial Review\nAs the Company continues in its phase of exploration and development, the results are relatively straightforward, and reflect a loss for the period of US$1.6 million (30 June 2022: US$1.5 million), primarily as a result of administration and corporate costs.\nNet cash of US$2.5 million was spent in the period (30 June 2022: US$5.3 million), consisting of the net impact of the administration costs and working capital movements of US$2.2 million, capitalised development costs of US$0.5 million, and US$0.2 million net proceeds of employee share option exercises.\nFinancing and Cash Position\nAt the time of this report, the Company has cash reserves of US$3.5 million, sufficient to cover the remaining Basic Engineering costs and working capital commitments for at least the next 12 months.\nOutlook for 2023\nFor the balance of the year, the Company's focus will remain on obtaining the environmental approval for the Project, putting in place a new funding agreement with its Strategic Investors, and finalising optimisation work ahead of a Bankable Feasibility Study.\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Jim Wynn / Charles Vaughan\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nLiberum Capital Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Matthew Hogg / Kane Collings\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nShard Capital (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\n+44 (0)20 7186 9927\nBlytheRay (Financial PR and IR)\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray / Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNotes to Editors\nEmmerson is focused on advancing the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or the \"Project\") in Morocco into a low cost, high margin supplier of potash, and the first primary producer on the African continent. With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts.\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the six months ended 30 June 2023\nUS$'000\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2023\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2022\n12 months to\n31 Dec 2022\nNotes\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nAdministrative expenses\n3\n(1,386",

Understandably, relief efforts will dominate government focus in the near term, as we await the Ministerial Committee meeting to approve our environmental permit, but we remain confident of a favourable outcome.\nThe existing financing facility with our strategic investors was due to expire at the end of the month. Given the long stop date required all permits and funding for construction to be in place, this deadline will not be met. In addition, the facility is now two years old, and various elements of the agreement now need to be revisited. The right time to do this is once the environmental approval is in place, and our strategic investors, who are also our largest shareholders, remain committed to the project, and are working with us to put in place something more appropriate as soon as possible.\n\"\nMark Zhou, director of GSM\n, commented: \"\nWe are happy to confirm our commitment to the Khemisset Project as Emmerson's largest shareholders and look forward to negotiating new funding which works for both parties at the appropriate time, in order to move the Project forwards towards construction as quickly as possible\n.\"\nEarthquake\nOn Friday 8 September 2023, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Morocco. The epicentre was located in the High Atlas Mountains, approximately 70km south of Marrakech. Emmerson's project and offices are located some distance away and were not affected directly. The Company has expressed its deepest sympathies to the people of Morocco at this difficult time and has made contributions both to the British Moroccan Society's fundraise, and the Moroccan Special Fund for the Management of the Effects of the Earthquake.\nEnvironmental approval\nThe Company's primary focus during 2023 has been on obtaining the Environmental & Social Impact Assessment (''ESIA'') approval for its Khemisset Project. As previously communicated, the main sensitivities have centred around the potential impact of the Project on regional water resources in the context of climate change and recent droughts, and considerable effort has been undertaken by the Company and the relevant authorities to identify solutions satisfactory to all stakeholders.\nIn July 2023, the environmental approval for the Project was referred by the Company to the Ministerial Committee\nto enable the decision to be taken at a national level on the basis that the Project is of strategic significance\n, and in the context of\nthe sensitivity of water resources in\nMorocco.\nFurther to ongoing discussions, the Company remains confident that approval will be forthcoming and is not aware of any significant outstanding issues to be resolved.\nThe Ministerial Committee was unable to sit ahead of the summer recess and was due to reconvene at a suitable time once government departments returned to work in late August. The precise timing of the Committee meeting remains to be determined, and it is likely that government resources are prioritised in the coming weeks on humanitarian relief and rehabilitation efforts following the recent earthquake.\nStrategic Investor\nIn November 2021, the Company signed a financing agreement with Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd (\"GSM\") and Gold Quay Capital Pte Ltd (\"GQC\") (together the \"Strategic Investors\") for U$5.8 million of equity at 6 pence and up to US$40 million of ",

With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This 2020 Feasibility Study delivered compelling economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion.\n1.\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na)\nName:\nJames Kelly\n2.\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status:\nChairman\nb)\nInitial notification/Amendment:\nInitial notification\n3.\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName:\nEmmerson PLC\nb)\nLEI:\n213800JA8ZK1K6CWYP61\n4.\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument:\nIdentification code:\nOrdinary Shares of NPV\nISIN:\u00a0IM00BDHDTX83\nb)\nNature of the transaction:\nPurchase\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s):\n448,000 Ordinary Shares at 2.1875 pence\nd)\nAggregated information:\nAggregated volume:\nPrice:\nn/a\u00a0- single transaction\ne)\nDate of the transaction:\n6 July 2023\nf)\nPlace of the transaction:\nLondon Stock Exchange\n1.\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na)\nName:\nHayden Locke\n2.\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status:\nDirector\nb)\nInitial notification/Amendment:\nInitial notification\n3.\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName:\nEmmerson PLC\nb)\nLEI:\n213800JA8ZK1K6CWYP61\n4.\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument:\nIdentification code:\nOrdinary Shares of NPV\nISIN:\u00a0IM00BDHDTX83\nb)\nNature of the transaction:\nPurchase\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s):\n365,000 Ordinary Shares at 2.458 pence\nd)\nAggregated information:\nAggregated volume:\nPrice:\nn/a\u00a0- single transaction\ne)\nDate of the transaction:\n6 July 2023\nf)\nPlace of the transaction:\nLondon Stock Exchange\n1.\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na)\nName:\nJim Wynn\n2.\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status:\nCFO\nb)\nInitial notification/Amendment:\nInitial notification\n3.\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market partici",

In particular, the issues raised have centred around the disposal of brines through deep well injection; the storage of salt tailings at surface; the use of water from local sources; and the impact of the project on local highways and land users.\nThe Company has invested considerable time and resources into developing robust solutions in all these areas, reflecting international best practice, including using dry stack tailings, and sourcing waste water rather than fresh water from nearby reservoirs. In addition, the Company has committed to completing in-situ injectivity testwork before construction to confirm definitively the feasibility of deep well injection as a means of disposing of brines, while examining alternative means to process brines in order to minimise, or even eliminate, the requirement for brine disposal.\nFollowing a recent evaluation meeting, the\nCommission R\u00e9gionale Unifi\u00e9e d'Investissement\n(\"CRUI\"), the regional investment authority, was unable to approve the application, and consequently the Company has exercised its right to refer approval to the Ministerial Committee, which is chaired by the Head of Government and includes several Government ministers. The Company believes the measures taken to address all concerns raised, combined with the project's significant economic benefits and contribution towards addressing food security, are compelling and underline its strategic importance to the Kingdom of Morocco. On this basis, the Company remains confident it will receive approval for its proposals.\nTechnical Workstreams\nThe work on the seven technical packages that make up the Basic Engineering workstream is now largely complete, with final drawings and reports only remaining in respect of power supply, highway junction, mine-site infrastructure and portal and decline designs.\nOnce completed, this information will be available for incorporation into an updated BFS, which will be commenced once environmental approval has been received, and is likely to take approximately six months to complete.\nThe BFS will include a detailed financial model based on the latest design of the plant and mine workings, as well as reflecting cost inflation since the Feasibility Study completed in 2020.\nProject financing\nFollowing environmental approval, the Company will proceed with the process of fundraising for the Khemisset Project. Due diligence and legal work will be required in respect of the bank debt, with the BFS a key part of this review. As far as possible, due diligence and the BFS work programmes will proceed in parallel in order to minimise the time between receiving environmental approval and reaching financial close.\nGraham Clarke, CEO, commented:\n\"Our primary focus has been obtaining the environmental approval for the project, and a considerable amount of rigorous and detailed work has gone into addressing all of the issues raised by the relevant authorities, which have mainly related to water. The environmental approval has recently been referred from the regional level up to the national Ministerial Committee.\n\"In reaching their decision, we remain confident that senior government officials on that Committee will take into account the significant amount of time and investment that has gone into minimising the environmental impact of the project, which we believe aligns closely with the Government strategy regarding sustainable development. Emmerson is firmly committed to maintaining the highest environmental standards in Morocco at every stage, from construction through to production.\n\"As soon as the permit has been granted, we will move to complete a BFS, which will include updated numbers for the market. We expect this study, which is a requirement of banks and other financiers, to take approximately six months.\n\"Thankfully, we are now seeing softening of inflation in capital costs along with commodity and particularly energy prices. Energy forms the largest single part of the operating costs. The impro",

I had hoped to\nbe in position to provide a definitive update on this process however the finer technical details of the water management proposals, in particular our use of recycled water from the Khemisset waste water treatment plant, and our brines and dry tailings so\nlutions, are awaiting final approvals from the environmental and water agencies.\nIt remains our absolute priority to finalise this as quickly as possible in conjunction with the Moroccan authorities with the objective of moving into construction this year.\nThe Company achieved a key milestone during the period in the form of the appoi\nntment of a syndicate of international and Moroccan banks to act as mandated lead arrangers, to co-ordinate and fund debt financing facilities for Khemisset. This is a huge step for Emmerson, and one that provides a clear and tangible route for us to deli\nver on the requisite financing for this large and strategically important asset.\nSecuring quality and experienced institutions including ING Bank, Banque Centrale Populaire and Bank of Africa (Groupe BMCE), together with UK Export Finance, which will lead\nan Export Credit Agency tranche of US$230 million, is a significant endorsement of the Project and its future earnings potential. I believe that this is also a clear signal to the market and our various stakeholders in Morocco, that ours is a project wit\nh the commercial clout and operational robustness to merit being fast-tracked into production.\n\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Jim Wynn / Charles Vaughan\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nLiberum Capital Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Kane Collings / William King\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nShard Capital LLP (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\n+44 (0)20 7186 9927\nSt Brides Partners (Financial PR/IR)\nSusie Geliher / Isabelle Morris\n+44 (0)20 7236 1177\nNotes to Editors\nEmmerson is focused on advancing the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or the \"Project\") in Morocco into a low cost, high margin supplier of potash, and the first primary producer on the African continent.

The appointment of the MLAs represents an important milestone in the Company's progress towards\nestablishing Africa's first commercial potash mine for nearly 50 years.\"\nSender International Ltd and Colosseum Development (Morocco) are advising Emmerson on the debt financing of the Project, working alongside Tamesis Partners LLP as the Company's financial adviser for the financing of the Project.

A number of important\nissues\nthat had held up progress\nhave been\nresolved\n, and discussions have moved onto the specifics of the Project's water management, which is a key area of concern in Morocco following low rainfall in recent years.\nO\nur proposals (including specific revisions) are robust and\nI am cautious\nly optimistic they\nwill be accepted, but\nthe timing of approvals is in the hands of the Moroccan authorities\n. We appreciate the patience of our shareholders and are committed to doing everything that is needed to get this over the line\n.\n\"\nWork in other are\nas has continued. Our technical workstreams (which of course include key elements relevant to water management such as sourcing water and tailings facilities) are now nearing completion, and we were also able to sign MOUs for around 2/3rd\ns\nof our potash production\non a take or pay basis\n, demonstrating the strength of demand for potash. Discussions with financiers continue, and we will provide updates at the appropriate times, although understandably the environmental approvals will unlock p\nrogress\n,\nparticularly on the equity side.\n\"\nI am confident we will be able to provide some substantive updates over\nthe course of\nQ1,\nand that\n2023\nwill be\na transformative year for Emmerson\n.\n\"\nEnvironmental permit\nThe Company's priority is to secure the necessary environmental approvals from the Moroccan authorities for the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or \"the Project\"). As Khemisset will be the first potash mine in Morocco, the authorities have sought to ensure that all aspects of the Project comply with the highest standards. This process is iterative, and has taken time, and the Company is aware of the frustration felt by shareholders over its inability to provide firm deadlines, or detailed commentaries. To a large extent, this is in the nature of such processes.\nThe Company has always emphasised the economic benefits of the Project to local communities, as well as the strategic importance of building a new source of potash in Morocco. These aspects have been widely acknowledged, and the Project has received significant support both in Morocco and in the UK.\nOver the course of 2022, the Company has been able to address a number of the wider issues relating to the Project, in particular its potential impact on local and neighbouring communities and businesses. Discussions have progressed more specifically onto matters concerning the Project's water management.\nForemost among these is the confirmation of the capacity to use recycled water from the Khemisset Waste Water Treatment Plant, instead of drawing freshwater direct from the Ouljet Essoltane Dam. This revision, developed in conjunction with Reminex SA, significantly mitigates risks around water supply levels during dry periods.\nThe Company has also determined that a dry tailings system will now be employed at Khemisset to reduce water consumption and essentially eliminate any risk of saline fluid outflow in the event of an extreme rainfall event. Such tailings storage facilities are in use at various potash operations around the world.\nThe finer technical details of the above, and other specific areas, continue to be reviewed by the environmental and water agencies. These proposals are in line with Emmerson's determination, as a responsible investor, to pursue the highest environmental standards in everything that we do at Khemisset. The Company is working through these solutions with the relevant government departments to ensure they are acceptable to all stakeholders, although the timing of final approvals is in the h",

As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts, and the spot price for granular MOP fertiliser has since risen, further enhancing the valuations.\n1.\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na)\nName:\nJim Wynn\n2.\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status:\nCFO\nb)\nInitial notification/Amendment:\nInitial notification\n3.\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName:\nEmmerson PLC\nb)\nLEI:\n213800JA8ZK1K6CWYP61\n4.\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument:\nIdentification code:\nOrdinary Shares of NPV\nISIN:\u00a0IM00BDHDTX83\nb)\nNature of the transaction:\nPurchase\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s):\n159,872 Ordinary Shares at 6\n.25 pence\nd)\nAggregated information:\nAggregated volume:\nPrice:\nn/a\u00a0- single transaction\ne)\nDate of the transaction:\n26 September 2022\nf)\nPlace of the transaction:\nLondon Stock Exchange\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

We are now well placed to move rapidly towards concluding the financing for the construction of the mine, once the final environmental approvals are received. Although these approvals have been taking longer than we had originally anticipated, the Moroccan authorities have assured us of their support for the Project, which all parties recognise has a significant role to play in the context of the global crisis around food security, of which potash supply is a key element.\n\"Today we announce the extension of our US$40 million financing commitment with Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd and Gold Quay Capital Pte Ltd, together with a US$6 million placing for new equity. These agreements demonstrate the ongoing support of our strategic investors and leave us funded for our remaining technical workstreams up to financial close. Once we receive the final environmental approvals, we expect financial close to take around six months if all goes well, and construction to commence soon thereafter. Subject to progress in the coming months on the environmental permit, we would hope to be able to commence construction in the second half of 2023.\n\"\nFinancing\nThe Company announces today that it has received further support from its strategic investors Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd (\"GSM\") and Gold Quay Capital Pte Ltd (\"GQC\") (together the \"Strategic Investors\") in the form of an extension to its existing Convertible Loan Notes agreement, and a new US$6.0 million subscription for new shares at a price of 6.0 pence per share by GSM. Further details of this important and positive development, and the opportunity for existing shareholders to participate alongside the GSM subscription are covered in separate announcements published immediately following this announcement.\nDiscussions have continued regarding the financing package for the construction project at Khemisset. A range of international and Moroccan banks have expressed interest in participating in the debt funding, while there has also been considerable interest in the equity portion, which is corner-stoned by the Strategic Investors' renewed commitment for up to US$64 million, comprising US$12 million of equity subscriptions to date (including US$6 million announced today), up to US$40 million of convertible notes, and potential additional funding of US$12 million from warrant exercises.\nThe combination of strong economics, solid jurisdiction, an experienced management team and a compelling investment case for potash have attracted significant attention from a variety of investors, in spite of some challenging market conditions.\nKhemisset\nEmmerson is committed to making Khemisset the first potash producer in Africa. Achieving this will enhance Morocco's status as a fertiliser hub supporting food security for Africa and the rest of the world and will confirm the country's growing reputation as an attractive destination for foreign investment. Emmerson's management is committed to working proactively with Morocco to ensure that the development of the Project aligns with the Kingdom's economic strategy through a mutually beneficial relationship that maximises local and national benefits. It will continue to engage closely with a wide range of Moroccan stakeholders to ensure the optimum",

With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts, and the spot price for granular MOP fertiliser has since risen, further enhancing the valuations.\n1.\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na)\nName:\nHayden Locke\n2.\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status:\nDirector\nb)\nInitial notification/Amendment:\nInitial notification\n3.\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName:\nEmmerson PLC\nb)\nLEI:\n213800JA8ZK1K6CWYP61\n4.\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument:\nIdentification code:\nOrdinary Shares of NPV\nISIN:\u00a0IM00BDHDTX83\nb)\nNature of the transaction:\nAllotment of share in satisfaction of option exercise\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s):\nVolume Price (\u00a3)\n6,879,090 at\n0\n.\n07030\nd)\nAggregated information:\nAggregated volume:\nPrice:\nn/a\ne)\nDate of the transaction:\n16 August 2022\nf)\nPlace of the transaction:\nOutside a trading Venue\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchang",

A timetable for the initial phase of the arbitration was determined. As a result, the Company is required to submit its Memorial by the end of Q1 2026.\nFollowing the submission of the Memorial which outlines the Company's case in full, including legal arguments, supporting evidence and the compensation sought, the arbitration will move to its next phase which will be the opportunity for the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco to respond.\nBackground\nOn 30 April 2025, the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries\u00a0Khemisset UK Ltd and Potasse de Khemisset S.A.\u00a0(the \"Claimants\") filed a Request for Arbitration (\"RFA\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"). The ICSID Secretary-General registered the RFA on 23 May 2025.\nThe Claimants seek\u00a0compensation for the loss and damage they sustained as a result of Morocco's breaches of its obligations under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\"), including (i) Morocco's expropriation of the Project in violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT, and (ii) Morocco's breach of its obligations to accord the Claimants fair and equitable treatment, to provide full protection and security to the Claimants and their investments, and to refrain from impairing the Claimants' investments by discriminatory measures under Article 2(2) of the BIT.\nThere can be no certainty as to the outcome of the Company's treaty claims.\nThe Company will provide further updates as the arbitration process progresses.\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson Plc\nGraham Clarke / Hayden Locke\n+44 (0)207 138 3204\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Will King\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nVSA Capital Limited (Joint Broker)\nAndrew Monk/Andrew Raca\n+44 (0)20 3005 5000\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

It would be useful for GC or HL to give some sort of interview about the situation and talk like Tim Foden did a few months back. I would like to hear from GC what if anything has happened with the patent and progress of the KMP process. This surely had some value and as he is technically still employed as full time CEO to see this case through for his crucial evidence for the claim, he must even though they are obviously spending as little as possible to maintain capital have been working on something other than just work to support the claim? Also I am a little unsure now when there might be some dilution, as part of RNS's from last autumn for GC's and other's retainment packages. Unsure how significant that may be at the moment, in terms of the short term share price picture. HL previously mentioned last November time about some unofficial contact and that he had told them to go through the proper channels. We can only presume there has been nothing in the way of a more official approach from anywhere to settle things prior to proceedings at this stage. I know there is a long wait ahead and I am determined to hold but I am unsure if there are many long term shareholders left now, unless everyone is just patiently waiting. I guess the statement of claim could come relatively soon now, still can't believe it came to this. I hear it's now all about 'flow' now in terms of share price movement. Clearly hardly anybody is buying and selling this at the moment, so little flow, when that may change I have no idea. Still hoping as still heavily underwater after over 5 years invested.",

It is worth mentioning that Morocco (OCP) are easily able to fund a settlement, and they are motivated to settle now, so that they can proceed with the \"entire\" Khemisset project (both the part owned by EML and the part owned by OCP).",

The Moroccans could claim inactivity through their  own mining code ACT 97.  If EML win or Morocco settle then the licences stay with us.  Then there is no way they can claim inactivity as they were the cause of it.  As to what will happen to these licence's should we win or settle is anyone's guess but I cannot imagine the mine will get completed by us due to the bad blood between the two parties.",

EML is a registered  UK company. The directors of EML are legally bound to the Company Act of 2006. EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.   At a guess I think when it is all over assuming a win or settlement, the licences could be sold to an interested party.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.  A lot of conjecture, but everything is possible with a mad man in the White House.",

It is important that the SOC amount does not fail the red nose test and that it does not seem to be exaggerated as it would make the case lose credibility. Foden won't go for an amount he's not confident they can get. Whatever the number it is going to be a high multiple of the current market cap though",

It\u2019s what I\u2019m half expecting and if it happens, I think I\u2019ll be quite chuffed about it having run some rough counts of offer value to SP.' We have to be clear, that by 'holding' , and 'waiting' it is evident that shares are not 'held', and one is 'holding' off buying.  How can you be 'holding' shares, and waiting. The whole point of the usage of 'waiting' in the original post , was waiting to buy nearer some 'nws' outflow from the IC, which will be early next year at earliest. Hence, Ferri, if you 'wait' to buy, and M Govt make an offer, you are somewhat screwed. So Ferri, what did I #make up' ?",

It would be useful for GC or HL to give some sort of interview about the situation and talk like Tim Foden did a few months back. I would like to hear from GC what if anything has happened with the patent and progress of the KMP process. This surely had some value and as he is technically still employed as full time CEO to see this case through for his crucial evidence for the claim, he must even though they are obviously spending as little as possible to maintain capital have been working on something other than just work to support the claim? Also I am a little unsure now when there might be some dilution, as part of RNS's from last autumn for GC's and other's retainment packages. Unsure how significant that may be at the moment, in terms of the short term share price picture. HL previously mentioned last November time about some unofficial contact and that he had told them to go through the proper channels. We can only presume there has been nothing in the way of a more official approach from anywhere to settle things prior to proceedings at this stage. I know there is a long wait ahead and I am determined to hold but I am unsure if there are many long term shareholders left now, unless everyone is just patiently waiting. I guess the statement of claim could come relatively soon now, still can't believe it came to this. I hear it's now all about 'flow' now in terms of share price movement. Clearly hardly anybody is buying and selling this at the moment, so little flow, when that may change I have no idea. Still hoping as still heavily underwater after over 5 years invested.",

I still believe the ' site water' was and probably still is the problem with EIA. FFS, The Kingdom has been in a drought situation for years, and even employed a 'local consultant'  to examine Environment Impact. Not even a mention of water in that report.  EML could have, and should have, been talking about a sea water Desal plant either built at coast or near the site, and pipe with the potable water, or sea water from coast to site. Costly, yes, but it could have raised finance with a NPV8 of $2B +. With the added bonus, that superfluous potable water at site could either be 'sold' on, or given to locals for Brownie points.  And further, as Trev raised, what about the value of KMP. It's now looking like it was a 'lifestyle company'.  Yes, I do remember The Herd and their comments on this BOD.. lol",

When all the dust has settled EML will still owner the mining licences until 2046. The only way the Moroccans can take them back is if EML lose the case.   The Moroccans could claim inactivity through their  own mining code ACT 97.  If EML win or Morocco settle then the licences stay with us.  Then there is no way they can claim inactivity as they were the cause of it.  As to what will happen to these licence's should we win or settle is anyone's guess but I cannot imagine the mine will get completed by us due to the bad blood between the two parties.",

EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.   At a guess I think when it is all over assuming a win or settlement, the licences could be sold to an interested party.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.  A lot of conjecture, but everything is possible with a mad man in the White House.",

The Moroccans could claim inactivity through their  own mining code ACT 97.  If EML win or Morocco settle then the licences stay with us.

EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.   At a guess I think when it is all over assuming a win or settlement, the licences could be sold to an interested party.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.

PAT after the huge run then consolidation also seem to climb steadily. From the aspect of flows: MON has just paid its award in divi this week, I assume many woll reinvest into similar cases. And ZEN after doubling again from its recent lows, expect its ruling any day. Fingers crossed: if that ruling is beneficial, many (hundreds, thoudands) scandinavian investor will find their way to EML also, helping the flow. And hopefully GRX will also have its annulment ruling. As EML-s case is one of the main work of Marcin Michalek, as was GRX previously, his polish and australian followers will arrive.

It is important that the SOC amount does not fail the red nose test and that it does not seem to be exaggerated as it would make the case lose credibility. Foden won't go for an amount he's not confident they can get. Whatever the number it is going to be a high multiple of the current market cap though",

It\u2019s what I\u2019m half expecting and if it happens, I think I\u2019ll be quite chuffed about it having run some rough counts of offer value to SP.' We have to be clear, that by 'holding' , and 'waiting' it is evident that shares are not 'held', and one is 'holding' off buying.  How can you be 'holding' shares, and waiting. The whole point of the usage of 'waiting' in the original post , was waiting to buy nearer some 'nws' outflow from the IC, which will be early next year at earliest. Hence, Ferri, if you 'wait' to buy, and M Govt make an offer, you are somewhat screwed. So Ferri, what did I #make up' ?",

No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis).

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.   At a guess I think when it is all over assuming a win or settlement, the licences could be sold to an interested party.",

The Moroccans could claim inactivity through their  own mining code ACT 97.  If EML win or Morocco settle then the licences stay with us.

EML could have, and should have, been talking about a sea water Desal plant either built at coast or near the site, and pipe with the potable water, or sea water from coast to site. Costly, yes, but it could have raised finance with a NPV8 of $2B +. With the added bonus, that superfluous potable water at site could either be 'sold' on, or given to locals for Brownie points.  And further, as Trev raised, what about the value of KMP. It's now looking like it was a 'lifestyle company'.  Yes, I do remember The Herd and their comments on this BOD.. lol",

It would be useful for GC or HL to give some sort of interview about the situation and talk like Tim Foden did a few months back. I would like to hear from GC what if anything has happened with the patent and progress of the KMP process. This surely had some value and as he is technically still employed as full time CEO to see this case through for his crucial evidence for the claim, he must even though they are obviously spending as little as possible to maintain capital have been working on something other than just work to support the claim? Also I am a little unsure now when there might be some dilution, as part of RNS's from last autumn for GC's and other's retainment packages. Unsure how significant that may be at the moment, in terms of the short term share price picture. HL previously mentioned last November time about some unofficial contact and that he had told them to go through the proper channels. We can only presume there has been nothing in the way of a more official approach from anywhere to settle things prior to proceedings at this stage. I know there is a long wait ahead and I am determined to hold but I am unsure if there are many long term shareholders left now, unless everyone is just patiently waiting. I guess the statement of claim could come relatively soon now, still can't believe it came to this. I hear it's now all about 'flow' now in terms of share price movement. Clearly hardly anybody is buying and selling this at the moment, so little flow, when that may change I have no idea. Still hoping as still heavily underwater after over 5 years invested.",

I expect some lateral SP move until mid/late feb and then a steady rise into Q1 end. Patience will be rewarded",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.  A lot of conjecture, but everything is possible with a mad man in the White House.",

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.

When all the dust has settled EML will still owner the mining licences until 2046. The only way the Moroccans can take them back is if EML lose the case.   The Moroccans could claim inactivity through their  own mining code ACT 97.  If EML win or Morocco settle then the licences stay with us.  Then there is no way they can claim inactivity as they were the cause of it.  As to what will happen to these licence's should we win or settle is anyone's guess but I cannot imagine the mine will get completed by us due to the bad blood between the two parties.",

At that point Morocco's team will advise on the likely outcome at Arbitration, and talks will begin. It is worth mentioning that Morocco (OCP) are easily able to fund a settlement, and they are motivated to settle now, so that they can proceed with the \"entire\" Khemisset project (both the part owned by EML and the part owned by OCP).",

Sound familiar. A timeline has now been issued by the Court. The initial arbitration was requested by PAT in July '24. The 'oral closing submissions' must be delivered by 11 Jan '27.  Say another month to decision. So, from start to finish 31 months. EML 'case' was implemented in Sept '24, and 31 months  gives us a possible decision timeline of April '27. My initial comment of 'come back in 2026' was too hopeful.  Of course, there is always the possibility of an early settlement,",

Costly, yes, but it could have raised finance with a NPV8 of $2B +. With the added bonus, that superfluous potable water at site could either be 'sold' on, or given to locals for Brownie points.

It would be useful for GC or HL to give some sort of interview about the situation and talk like Tim Foden did a few months back. I would like to hear from GC what if anything has happened with the patent and progress of the KMP process. This surely had some value and as he is technically still employed as full time CEO to see this case through for his crucial evidence for the claim, he must even though they are obviously spending as little as possible to maintain capital have been working on something other than just work to support the claim? Also I am a little unsure now when there might be some dilution, as part of RNS's from last autumn for GC's and other's retainment packages. Unsure how significant that may be at the moment, in terms of the short term share price picture. HL previously mentioned last November time about some unofficial contact and that he had told them to go through the proper channels. We can only presume there has been nothing in the way of a more official approach from anywhere to settle things prior to proceedings at this stage. I know there is a long wait ahead and I am determined to hold but I am unsure if there are many long term shareholders left now, unless everyone is just patiently waiting. I guess the statement of claim could come relatively soon now, still can't believe it came to this. I hear it's now all about 'flow' now in terms of share price movement. Clearly hardly anybody is buying and selling this at the moment, so little flow, when that may change I have no idea. Still hoping as still heavily underwater after over 5 years invested.",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.

EML could have, and should have, been talking about a sea water Desal plant either built at coast or near the site, and pipe with the potable water, or sea water from coast to site. Costly, yes, but it could have raised finance with a NPV8 of $2B +. With the added bonus, that superfluous potable water at site could either be 'sold' on, or given to locals for Brownie points.  And further, as Trev raised, what about the value of KMP. It's now looking like it was a 'lifestyle company'.  Yes, I do remember The Herd and their comments on this BOD.. lol",

It would be useful for GC or HL to give some sort of interview about the situation and talk like Tim Foden did a few months back. I would like to hear from GC what if anything has happened with the patent and progress of the KMP process. This surely had some value and as he is technically still employed as full time CEO to see this case through for his crucial evidence for the claim, he must even though they are obviously spending as little as possible to maintain capital have been working on something other than just work to support the claim? Also I am a little unsure now when there might be some dilution, as part of RNS's from last autumn for GC's and other's retainment packages. Unsure how significant that may be at the moment, in terms of the short term share price picture. HL previously mentioned last November time about some unofficial contact and that he had told them to go through the proper channels. We can only presume there has been nothing in the way of a more official approach from anywhere to settle things prior to proceedings at this stage. I know there is a long wait ahead and I am determined to hold but I am unsure if there are many long term shareholders left now, unless everyone is just patiently waiting. I guess the statement of claim could come relatively soon now, still can't believe it came to this. I hear it's now all about 'flow' now in terms of share price movement. Clearly hardly anybody is buying and selling this at the moment, so little flow, when that may change I have no idea. Still hoping as still heavily underwater after over 5 years invested.",

Obviously the best possible RNS is one that says the company has been presented with a substantial offer to settle the dispute and is carefully considering the proposal but somehow I think that is unlikely. Would also be good to have some info or an interview with HL arrive somewhere.",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.  A lot of conjecture, but everything is possible with a mad man in the White House.",

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.

When all the dust has settled EML will still owner the mining licences until 2046. The only way the Moroccans can take them back is if EML lose the case.   The Moroccans could claim inactivity through their  own mining code ACT 97.  If EML win or Morocco settle then the licences stay with us.  Then there is no way they can claim inactivity as they were the cause of it.  As to what will happen to these licence's should we win or settle is anyone's guess but I cannot imagine the mine will get completed by us due to the bad blood between the two parties.",

It is worth mentioning that Morocco (OCP) are easily able to fund a settlement, and they are motivated to settle now, so that they can proceed with the \"entire\" Khemisset project (both the part owned by EML and the part owned by OCP).",

It would be useful for GC or HL to give some sort of interview about the situation and talk like Tim Foden did a few months back. I would like to hear from GC what if anything has happened with the patent and progress of the KMP process. This surely had some value and as he is technically still employed as full time CEO to see this case through for his crucial evidence for the claim, he must even though they are obviously spending as little as possible to maintain capital have been working on something other than just work to support the claim? Also I am a little unsure now when there might be some dilution, as part of RNS's from last autumn for GC's and other's retainment packages. Unsure how significant that may be at the moment, in terms of the short term share price picture. HL previously mentioned last November time about some unofficial contact and that he had told them to go through the proper channels. We can only presume there has been nothing in the way of a more official approach from anywhere to settle things prior to proceedings at this stage. I know there is a long wait ahead and I am determined to hold but I am unsure if there are many long term shareholders left now, unless everyone is just patiently waiting. I guess the statement of claim could come relatively soon now, still can't believe it came to this. I hear it's now all about 'flow' now in terms of share price movement. Clearly hardly anybody is buying and selling this at the moment, so little flow, when that may change I have no idea. Still hoping as still heavily underwater after over 5 years invested.",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.  A lot of conjecture, but everything is possible with a mad man in the White House.",

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.

Morocco will wait until they see the value of the Claim and the precise detail of the statement of EML's claim (plea, memorial or whatever).  At that point Morocco's team will advise on the likely outcome at Arbitration, and talks will begin. It is worth mentioning that Morocco (OCP) are easily able to fund a settlement, and they are motivated to settle now, so that they can proceed with the \"entire\" Khemisset project (both the part owned by EML and the part owned by OCP).",

Here's how I summarised it in my notes, and I'll eventually upload the full writeup here: https://substack.com/@caseresearch - ICSID Case (Emmerson Plc v Kingdom of Morocco, Case # ARB/25/22) - Dispute: rejection of environmental/social impact assessment; water usage concerns - RFA: 23rd May 2025 - Emmerson Water Efforts: capex heavy reductions to get usage down 50%; multiple rejections followed - Morocco's over conservatism: Emmerson would only use 0.6% of reserves; pos. socio-economic / water usage tradeoff - Rejections: multiple rounds; no progress; ICSID responsible choice - Incentives: Morocco's is unclear; Emmerson's water planned not otherwise allocated - BIT Breach: lack of fair and equitable treatment clear; includes lacking compensation on/before expropriation date - Parties Track Record - Emmerson arbitrator: 93% of wins (appointing side W/ favorable outcome) while representing claimant, and 62% overall - Emmerson backing: BSF / Tim Foden, who is a highly competent lawyer with a great track record - Moroccan legal counsel: 1/3 win rate, only done three cases, and arbitrator has 57% win rate, with all losses while representing the state - Incentives: Emmerson's litigation funding is non-recourse; (unrelated) some tribunal inter-personal bias inevitable, so not wholly rational / fact based outcome - Valuation (US$) - Award P/S (prob weighted; net of liabilities): 0.53 - Price P/S: 0.03 - Target P/S: 0.53 - MC($Mn): 42.00 - Upside: 1679.30% - CAGR: 58% (6 years) - Risk / Return: 1/17 - Margin of Safety: 85% reduction in award estimate --> 1:3 risk:return tradeoff - Allocation: future dividend unclear, likely at least in part - Catalyst: case progression gives many, periodic, chances to make odds / EML's fair value more apparent - Risks - Bear Case: Loss - Potash Price Leverage: compensation (award) based on project value, so Potash price leverage - No monetary award: no other value driver currently - Enforcement trouble: ICSID ruling doesn't equal forced payment; another proceeding required - Poor award allocation: if new project pursued, a poor project would warrant a lower valuation; no guarantee if up/down post-award date - Reason for discount - Shareholder turnover: junior mining investors out, new arbitration holders need time to assess - Ignorance - Single value driver: dependence on case may drive conservatism, at least for now - Niche: arbitrations, especially early stage, are not as popular as e.g. Buffet's style - Volume: \u00a325k per day ($32k) rules out many funds / competent investors.

If only I had the foresight to have sold at 2.2p and bought back, you just never know what will happen. I think we can assume Morocco  are not looking to settle and the share price is just drifting down. Really we need to know the size of the claim and that's not coming until next year.

Costly, yes, but it could have raised finance with a NPV8 of $2B +. With the added bonus, that superfluous potable water at site could either be 'sold' on, or given to locals for Brownie points.  And further, as Trev raised, what about the value of KMP. It's now looking like it was a 'lifestyle company'.  Yes, I do remember The Herd and their comments on this BOD.. lol",

It would be useful for GC or HL to give some sort of interview about the situation and talk like Tim Foden did a few months back. I would like to hear from GC what if anything has happened with the patent and progress of the KMP process. This surely had some value and as he is technically still employed as full time CEO to see this case through for his crucial evidence for the claim, he must even though they are obviously spending as little as possible to maintain capital have been working on something other than just work to support the claim? Also I am a little unsure now when there might be some dilution, as part of RNS's from last autumn for GC's and other's retainment packages. Unsure how significant that may be at the moment, in terms of the short term share price picture. HL previously mentioned last November time about some unofficial contact and that he had told them to go through the proper channels. We can only presume there has been nothing in the way of a more official approach from anywhere to settle things prior to proceedings at this stage. I know there is a long wait ahead and I am determined to hold but I am unsure if there are many long term shareholders left now, unless everyone is just patiently waiting. I guess the statement of claim could come relatively soon now, still can't believe it came to this. I hear it's now all about 'flow' now in terms of share price movement. Clearly hardly anybody is buying and selling this at the moment, so little flow, when that may change I have no idea. Still hoping as still heavily underwater after over 5 years invested.",

Potash fertiliser prices rose significantly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at the time was a large producer. No end in sight to that conflict, although USA will not supply further monies to buy military hardware, and basically has given Putin the 'go ahead' to 'win' the conflict in the next 6 months. This will only change if Eu decides, with a large monetary investment, to supply Ukraine with all it needs. Doubtful. The main problem then will be if USA is willing to sell Eu arms.?  IMHO, what is needed for Ukraine, and maybe The World, to survive, is for the Democrat party in USA, to gain enough seats in the November mid-term elections to win both houses. Trump would be impeached, and I believe there are sufficient numbers of  Republicans, who would want Trump out, and a new path forward, more in line with Republican philosophy,  rather than the war mongering Empire building, of a Malignant Narcissist.  Apols for the 'rant'.  So, one way or 't'other, I believe the conflict will end this year. This will bring more fertiliser to market, and Brasil has a new Govt policy for 'fertiliser' exploration, and wants to be self sufficient.  OCP are obviously aware of this, and the probability that MOP prices will fall, and thus reduce the NAV of the Khemisett mine.  A lot of conjecture, but everything is possible with a mad man in the White House.",

OCP is effectively the Government in the Fertilizer area.  Until 2008, OCP was the \"Office of Phosphates\" of the Government concerned with all aspects of Phosphates (whilst another part of Government, ONHYM [Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines], deals with Oil and other Minerals).  OCP became a 95% Government owned corporation when it needed capital from the issue of equity (as Banks would not provide funds during the financial crisis). So its very much the case that if Morocco/OCP wants to settle the case with EML, then OCP (which is hugely profitable) will foot the bill.",

If talks to begin, we will either get a massive reduction to fair value, slowed timeline as Morocco use these settlement negotiations as an excuse to drag things out, or both. I'm not entirely sure settlement will be easy for them. They have the money, but there's no sign of any willingness/lack of, so it's safer to assume they'll resists - as is the incentive of the desperate. @ComesMarcellino the GRX success has little overlap with EML, and it may only be of use for the Tribunal's mental models. Not something we can factor in. @JazyGeoff I assume you mean expropriation, as per the article 6(1) of the UK-Morocco BIT. yes Emmerson will own the mining license, but it won't mean anything if they've already been compensated. It could be a mix. The inactivity argument is interesting, and Morocco will definitely give it a go. It's a risk the Tribunal agree more with them than us on that front, but the BSF backing helps put the odds in our favor. The settlement would likely mean the concessions are transferred over, otherwise you're looking at double compensation. But as I said it could be a mix, at which point EML becomes more economically complex.",

EML is a registered  UK company. The directors of EML are legally bound to the Company Act of 2006. EML Directors could face fiduciary duty claims if they agree to transfer the licences without trying to achieve full value for its shareholders. Directors cannot agree to transfer the licences for less than fair value without exposing themselves to personal lawsuits under the Companies Act 2006.  Morocco will not want to pay full value, it defeats doing a deal in the first place.  Anyone of us could bring a case against the Directors.   This they wouldn't want.   At a guess I think when it is all over assuming a win or settlement, the licences could be sold to an interested party.",

The Moroccans could claim inactivity through their  own mining code ACT 97.  If EML win or Morocco settle then the licences stay with us.  Then there is no way they can claim inactivity as they were the cause of it.
