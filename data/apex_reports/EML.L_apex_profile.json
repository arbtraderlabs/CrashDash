The ICSID Secretary-General registered the RFA on 23 May 2025.\nThe Claimants seek\ncompensation for the loss and damage they sustained as a result of Morocco's breaches of its obligations under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\"), including (i) Morocco's expropriation of the Project in violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT, and (ii) Morocco's breach of its obligations to accord the Claimants fair and equitable treatment, to provide full protection and security to the Claimants and their investments, and to refrain from impairing the Claimants' investments by discriminatory measures under Article 2(2) of the BIT.\nThe Claimants will quantify the amount of compensation sought during the course of the arbitral proceedings, taking into account that the Company's most recent valuation of the Project was approximately US$ 2.2 billion.\nOn 5 August 2025, Stanimir A. Alexandrov (a Bulgarian national) accepted his appointment by the Claimants as arbitrator. On 15 August 2025, Zachary Douglas KC, a national of Australia and Switzerland, accepted his appointment by the Respondent as arbitrator. The Company anticipates that the arbitral tribunal will be constituted in or around October 2025. The Company further anticipates that the Claimants' written memorial will be due in or around Q1 2026 and will set forth in greater detail the factual and legal grounds for the Claimants' claims.\nThe Claimants will continue zealously to pursue their claims in this matter.\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson

General information\nEmmerson PLC (the \"Company\") is a company incorporated and domiciled in the Isle of Man, whose shares have since 27 April 2021 been listed on AIM.\nThe principal activities of the Group are the pursuance of a dispute with the Moroccan Government regarding the Khemisset Potash project, and the development of the Company's proprietary potash processing technology known as KMP. In previous years, the principal activity was the development of the Khemisset Potash project, however the rejection of the Company's environmental permit application in October 2024, resulting in the total expropriation of the Project, necessitated a change in strategy.\n2. Basis of preparation\n2.1 General\nThe Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the valuation and recognition principles of UK-adopted International Accounting Standards. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2025 are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the Group's auditor, and do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements.\nThey should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unchanged from those disclosed in those statements. These policies have been consistently applied to each of the periods presented.\nThe financial information of the Group is presented in US Dollars, which is also the functional currency of the parent Company and has been prepared under the historical cost convention. The individual financial statements of each of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency).\n2.2 Basis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, Moroccan Salts Limited (\"MSL\"), Potasse de Khemisset SA, Mines de Centre SARL, and Khemisset UK Ltd (\"KUL\").\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\nGenerally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\u00b7\nThe contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;\n\u00b7\nRights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nThe Group's voting rights and potential voting rights.\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Group Financial Statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\nAll intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets, are eliminated in full.\nAll the Group's companies have 31 December as their year-end. Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions.\n2.3 Functional and presentational currency\nThe financial information of the Group is presented in US Dollars, which is also the functional currency of the parent Company, and has been prepared under the historical cost convention. The individual financial statements of each of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency).\n2.4 Going concern\nAs at 18 September 2025 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$1.1 million. On 2 January 2025, the Company signed a Capital Provision Agreement (\"CPA\") with a specialist litigation funding firm to provide up to US$11.0 million in both litigation finance capital and working capital for the Company.\nThe Company has prepared a cashflow forecast to December 2026 setting out the expected financial commitments related to the running of the Group in its reduced scale, and the legal and other advisory expenses related to the ongoing dispute with the Moroccan government. The Company will not commit to further material financial obligations for at least the 12 months from the date of this report in order to protect its Going Concern position.\nBased on a review of the cashflow forecast, the Board is satisfied that the existing cash and funding facility are more than sufficient to meet the Company's outgoings for at least 12 months from the date of this report, and therefore believe the Going Concern basis is appropriate for the preparation of the financial statements.\n3. Administrative fee and other expenses\nUS$'000\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2025\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2024\n12 months to\n31 Dec 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nDirectors' fees\n380\n296\n599\nDepreciation\n-\n5\n16\nTravel\nand accommodation\n3\n6\n2\nAuditors' remuneration\n18\n37\n63\nEmployment costs\n19\n425\n702\nProfessional and consultancy fees\n289\n565\n1,055\nOther expenses\n227\n162\n2,001\nTotal Administrative Expenses\n936\n1,496\n4,438\n4. Litigation funding\nOn 2 January 2025, the Company announced that it had signed a Capital Provision Agreement (\"CPA\") with a specialist litigation funding firm to provide up to US$11.0 million in both litigation finance capital and working capital for the Company (the \"Funding\"). Funds advanced under the CPA can be used to settle legal fees connected with the case, as well as for general working capital purposes, subject to approvals.\nFunds advanced are non-recourse and are not repayable in the event of the legal case being lost. If the case has a successful outcome, the litigation funding firm will receive capital a capital entitlement based on multiples of the amounts advanced, or a percentage of the total settlement, depending on the timing and quantum of the settlement.\nBecause the funds advanced confer present benefits whose value can be quantified, these advances are recognised as Other Income. The balance of entitlements under the CPA will be recognised upon settlement of the legal case, as a reduction against the final award.\nDuring the period, the Company incurred litigation expenses of US$1,004k, of which US$727k were settled through advances and has been recognised as Other Income. The balance of US$277k has been recorded as a Current Liability.\n5. Current and Non-current liabilities\nOn 30 April 2025, the Company reached a legal settlement agreement related to a contract dated 29 November 2021 relating to the provision of basic engineering package for the Company's Khemisset Potash Project. The settlement amount agreed between both parties is US$427k, payable in 3 instalments with the final payment due on 27 May 2027. This amount has been split between current and non-current liabilities accordingly.\n6. Earnings per share\nThe calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:\nUS$'000\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2025\n6 months to\n30 Jun 2024\n12 months to\n31 Dec 2024\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\nEarnings\nLoss from continuing operations for the period attributable to the equity holders of the Company\n(1,290)\n(1,596)\n(25,770)\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share\n1,293,070,615\n1,052,292,157\n1,111,428,463\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n0.10 cents\n0.15 cents\n2,32 cents\n7.

This is now the Company's primary focus, and we are confident of a successful outcome. In the meantime, we are also exploring ways to valorise our proprietary potash processing methodology, known as the KMP, while remaining focused on minimising expenditure. We will provide updates on the progress of our activities during 2025\n\".\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nPanmure Liberum Limited (Nominated Advisor and Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Will King\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014.\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S STATEMENT\n2024 started positively with the announcement of the Khemisset Multi-mineral Process (\"KMP\") and progress with the environmental approval, as this was successfully referred back to the\nCentre R\u00e9gional d'Investissement\n(\"CRI\") for review following the appeal to the Ministerial Committee. However, in spite of the Company`s best efforts, the innovation of the Khemisset Multi-mineral Process, interaction with the relevant authorities and the addressing of the environmental issues previously raised, the Company received a second unfavourable outcome in regard to the approval of the environmental licence in October 2024. Following legal advice and a review of the options open to the Company, the decision was taken at the beginning of November to inform the Government of The Kingdom of Morocco that there was an investment dispute between the Company and the Government. The Company appointed Boies Schiller Flexner LLP as its litigation counsel and commenced investigating routes for litigation funding.\nThe ESIA and Litigation\nThe primary focus for the Company at the beginning of 2024 was to obtain the approval of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (\"ESIA\")\n.\nThe Company, having sent an appeal to the Ministerial Committee in 2023 was still awaiting progress at the beginning of the 2024 financial year. The Committee was unable to sit before late January 2024; government priorities were impacted in the intervening period by more pressing matters such as the tragic earthquake in September 2023.\nDuring January 2024, the Company announced that it had been working on a new process, the KMP, which further addressed many of the concerns regarding the environment that had been previously raised by the authorities. And, with the huge reduction in water consumption and removal of any need for waste brine disposal, delivered an excellent solution to the main issues. Emmerson has always maintained that the Khemisset Project has adhered to the highest international standards in terms of environmental compliance, including its water use, and the responsible management of waste brines and tailings. The introduction of the KMP further supported the environmental credentials of the Company.\nIn March 2024, the Company was informed that the Ministerial Committee had upheld its appeal and referred the matter back to the CRI\u00a0of the region Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra for reconsideration, inviting the Company to include optimisations into its latest ESIA submission.\nIn April, the Company submitted an updated ESIA, including the optimisations from the KMP related to water usage and waste management.\nFollowing the submission of the updated ESIA the Company continued to engage with the authorities and had expected that the CRI would call a meeting within a matter of weeks but subsequently were informed that a sub-committee had been formed at Ministry level to further analyse the updated ESIA prior to the CRI being able to make any decision.\nIn mid-October the Company was informed that the CRI had in fact called a meeting of the\nCommission R\u00e9gionale Unifi\u00e9e de l'Investissement\n(\"CRUI\")\u00a0and that the committee had returned a second unfavourable recommendation in regard to the ESIA for the project.\nFollowing a review of regulatory and legal options, the Company announced on 1 November 2024 it had informed the Government of The Kingdom of Morocco (\"the Government\") that there was an investment dispute between the Company and the Government, arising out of various breaches by the Government and its Agents of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was signed on 30 October 1990 and entered into force on 14 February 2002, the Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"BIT\").\nThe Company appointed Boies Schiller Flexner LLP as its litigation counsel.\nThe Company was able to secure litigation funding in a relatively short period of time, and on 2 January 2025 announced that funding of US$11 million had been secured from a leading litigation funder and was now available.\nFollowing the securing of the funding, work commenced on the case and the formal Request for Arbitration was submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes at the beginning of May 2025.\nUpdated Financial Estimates and Financing\nIn February 2024, the Company was able to announce the results of a Scoping Study which outlined the KMP process enhancements, whereby magnesium and iron chlorides in the brines would be precipitated out as struvite and vivianite respectively, after reaction with phosphates and ammonia.\nThis process would then allow the brines to be recirculated back into the plant, instead of disposed of through Deep Water Injection (\"DWI\"), yielding a number of significant benefits.\nThe most significant of these benefits relate to water, as the recirculation of brines reduces the overall consumption of raw water by 50% compared with the 2020 Feasibility Study, and addressed the primary environmental issues raised by the Government in its earlier assessment of the ESIA application.\nThe financial benefits to the project were significant and summarised below -\nParameter (real unless stated)\n2020 Feasibility Study\n2023 Updates\nOriginal Design updated\nKMP Process Solution\nCapex\nUS$411m\nUS$539m\nUS$525m\nMOP Cash Cost FOB Casablanca\nUS$147/t\nUS$164/t\nUS$156/t\nMOP Cash Cost CFR Brazil net of salt credit\nUS$110/t\nUS$139/t\nUS$133/t\nAll-in-Sustaining Cash Cost CFR Brazil net of salt credit\nUS$136/t\nUS$171/t\nUS$163/t\nAnnual EBITDA (nominal)\nUS$286m\nUS$258m\nUS$440m\nPost Tax Cash Flow (nominal)\nUS$3.8bn\nUS$3.0bn\nUS$5.9bn\nPost Tax NPV8 (nominal)\nUS$1.4bn\nUS$1.0bn\nUS$2.2bn\nPost Tax IRR (nominal)\n40%\n26%\n40%\nIt is also worthy of note that the signed mandates with a syndicate of international and Moroccan banks for a debt facility US$310 million, of which US$230 million would be a tranche covered by a UK Export Finance guarantee, were renewed for a further year at the end of 2023 so were still in place at the point at which the Company had to announce that it was in dispute with the Moroccan Government.\nIn April 2024, the Company announced the results of a successful share placing, bringing in gross proceeds of US$2.5 million. Of this, Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd (\"GSM\") and Gold Quay Capital Pte Ltd (\"GQC\") (together the \"Strategic Investors\") contributed US$2.0 million and US$0.2 million respectively, at a price of 1.75 pence per share. The Strategic Investors also received 1:1 warrants at 3 pence per share, expiring on 31 December 2024 and this signified the continuing support the Company had from its Strategic Investor at the time.\nIn addition, the Company also raised US$0.3 million from its wider shareholder base at the same price, through the REX retail platform. This offering was significantly oversubscribed.\nThese funds strengthened the Company's balance sheet and enabled work to continue on the KMP, the ESIA process, and for general working capital.\nPost the unfavourable recommendation from the CRUI and the announcement of the dispute with the Government of Morocco the Company raised \u00a30.85million (USD1.07million) in early December 2024 to provide funds to ensure that the Company had time to pursue the various options for litigation funding, as well as continuing to develop the KMP process as a standalone area of intellectual property under patent protection.\nOutlook for 2025\nThe clear priority for 2025 is to work with our legal advisors and proceed with the legal process with regard to the dispute and future arbitration.\nI look forward to providing further updates as 2025 progresses.\nGraham Clarke\nChief Executive Officer\n30 June 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\n2024\n2023\nNote\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nContinuing operations\nAdministrative expenses\n3\n(4,438)\n(2,664)\nImpairment\n2.15, 7, 8\n(21,103)\n-\nShare-based payment expense\n13\n(270)\n(335)\nNet foreign exchange (loss)/gain\n(18)\n18\nOperating loss\n(25,829)\n(2,981)\nFinance cost\n(5)\n(11)\nLoss before tax\n(25,834)\n(2,992)\nIncome tax\n5\n64\n-\nLoss for the year attributable to equity owners\n(25,770)\n(2,992)\nOther comprehensive income\nItems that may be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss:\nExchange (loss)/gain on translating foreign operations\n(306)\n117\nTotal comprehensive loss attributable to equity owners\n(26,076)\n(2,875)\nEarnings per share (cents)\nBasic and diluted\n6\n(2.319)\n(0.293)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS AT\n31 DECEMBER 2024\n2024\n2023\nNote\nUS$'000\nUS$'000\nNon-current assets\nIntangible assets\n2.9,7\n-\n20,457\nProperty, plant and equipment\n-\n31\nTotal non-current assets\n-\n20,488\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n8\n762\n1,080\nCash and cash equivalents\n923\n1,937\nTotal current assets\n1,685\n3,017\nTotal assets\n1,685\n23,505\nNon-current liabilities\nLong-term liabilities\n10\n(354)\n-\nTotal non-current liabilities\n(354)\n-\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n9\n(472)\n(346)\nTotal current liabilities\n(472)\n(346)\nNet assets\n859\n23,159\nShareholders equity attributable to equity owners\nShare capital\n12\n38,464\n34,958\nShare-based payment reserve\n13\n1,202\n1,633\nReverse acquisition reserve\n2,234\n2,234\nRetained earnings\n(40,520)\n(15,451)\nTranslation reserve\n(521)\n(215)\nTotal equity\n859\n23,159\nThese financial statements were approved by the Board on 30 June 2025 and signed on their behalf by\nGraham Clarke\nDirector\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nUS$'000\nShare Capital\nShare-based payment reserve\nReverse Acquisition reserve\nRetained earnings\nTranslation reserve\nTotal equity\nBalance at 1 January 2023\n34,733\n2,470\n2,234\n(13,636)\n(332)\n25,469\nLoss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(2,992)\n-\n(2,992)\nOther comprehensive income:\nFX loss translating foreign operations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n117\n117\nTotal comprehensive loss\n-\n-\n-\n(2,992)\n117\n(2,875)\nFair value of share options\n-\n335\n-\n-\n-\n335\nOptions/warrants exercised for cash\n225\n(62)\n-\n60\n-\n223\nOptions exercised cashless\n-\n(187)\n-\n187\n-\n-\nWarrants expired\n-\n(930)\n-\n930\n-\n-\nNet adjustment for options cancelled\n-\n7\n-\n-\n-\n7\nTotal transactions with owners\n225\n(837)\n-\n1,177\n-\n565\nBalance at 31 December 2023\n34,958\n1,633\n2,234\n(15,451)\n(215)\n23,159\nLoss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(25,770)\n-\n(25,770)\nOther comprehensive income:\nFX gain translating foreign operations\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(306)\n(306)\nTotal comprehensive loss\n-\n-\n-\n(25,770)\n(306)\n(26,076)\nFair value of share options/warrants\n-\n270\n-\n-\n-\n270\nShares issued in year\n3,629\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3,629\nCost of issuing shares\n(123)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(123)\nOptions/warrants expired\n-\n(701)\n-\n701\n-\n-\nTotal transactions with owners\n3,506\n(431)\n-\n701\n-\n3,776\nBalance at 31 December 2024\n38,464\n1,202\n2,234\n(40,520)\n(521)\n859\nThe nature of the share-based payment and reverse acquisition reserves are described in note 13 and 14.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nNotes\n2024\n2023\nUS$\n'000\nUS$\n'000\nCash flows from operating activities\nLoss before tax\n(25,834)\n(2,992)\nAdjustments\nForeign exchange\n18\n(18)\nTaxation\n5\n64\n-\nIntangible asset impairment\n7\n20,352\n-\nVAT receivable impairment\n8\n751\n-\nDirectors' remuneration settled in shares\n90\n-\nShare-based payment -

General information\nEmmerson PLC (the \"Company\") is a company incorporated and domiciled in the Isle of Man, whose shares have since\n27 April 2021 been listed on AIM.\nThe principal activity of the Group is the pursuance of a dispute with the Moroccan Government regarding the Khemisset Potash project, and the development of the Company's proprietary potash processing technology known as KMP. In previous years, the principal activity was the development of the Khemisset Potash project, however the rejection of the Company's environmental permit application in October 2024 necessitated a change in strategy.\n2. Basis of preparation\n2.1.\nGeneral\nThe Company and Group's Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (\"UK-IAS\"). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value.\n2.2.\nFunctional and presentational currency\nThe financial information of the Group is presented in US dollars to the nearest thousand.\nThe individual financial statements of each of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate (functional currency), these being US dollar and Moroccan Dirhams.\n2.3.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\nGenerally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\u00b7\nThe contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;\n\u00b7\nRights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nThe Group's voting rights and potential voting rights\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Group Financial Statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\nAll intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets, are eliminated in full.\nAll the Group's companies have 31 December as their year-end. Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions.\n2.4.\nGoing concern\nAs at 25 June 2025 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$0.5 million. On 2 January 2025, the Company signed a Capital Provision Agreement (\"CPA\") with a specialist litigation funding firm to provide up to US$11.0 million in both litigation finance capital and working capital for the Company.\nThe Company has prepared a cashflow forecast to December 2026 setting out the expected financial commitments related to the running of the Group in its reduced scale, and the legal and other advisory expenses related to the ongoing dispute with the Moroccan government.\nThe outcome of the litigation is expected to take at least 12 months from the date of this report, and possibly significantly longer. Litigation costs can therefore be anticipated with confidence, and ongoing operating costs have been reduced significantly in order to conserve cash.\nIf the legal case is resolved through negotiation out of court, this may occur sooner, but would be likely to be a favourable outcome for the Company that would likely result in either a cash settlement, or if in the form of an alternative beneficial arrangement, would put the Company in a stronger position such that its ability to raise funds would be significantly improved.\nThe Company will not commit to further material financial obligations for at least the 12 months from the date of this report in order to protect its Going Concern position.\nShould the legal case be decided against the Company, then EML would undoubtedly face a challenge in determining its next course of action. Such options could include continuing to appeal the case, or deciding to focus on other business opportunities, including the marketing of the KMP. However, as such an outcome is not expected to be in the 12 months from the date of this report, it is not considered a risk to the Going Concern basis.\nBased on a review of the cashflow forecast, the Board is satisfied that the existing cash and funding facility are more than sufficient to meet the Company's outgoings for at least 12 months from the date of this report, and therefore believe the Going Concern basis is appropriate for the preparation of the financial statements.\n2.5.\nChanges in accounting policies\nStandards, interpretations and amendments to published standards effective from 1 January 2024\nThere were no new standards or interpretations effective and adopted for the first time for the year beginning on or after 1 January 2024 that had a significant effect on the Group's or Company's financial statements.\nStandards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective\nAt the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (effective 1 January 2025)\n\u00b7\nIFRS 18: Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2027) 1\n\u00b7\nIFRS 19: Subsidiaries Without Public Accountability: Disclosures (effective 1 January 2027) 1\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure (effective 1 January 2026) 1\n\u00b7\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards - volume 11 (effective 1 January 2026)\n\u00b7\nIFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (effective 1 January 2024) 1\n\u00b7\nIFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (effective 1 January 2024) 1\n1\nThese standards have not yet been endorsed in the UK.\nThe Company is assessing the effect of these new and amended standards and interpretations, which are in issue but not yet mandatorily effective, but their impact is currently not expected to be material.\n2.6.\nSegment reporting\nA business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.\nThe Directors are of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment (2023: single segment) of business being the ongoing dispute with the Moroccan Government over the Khemisset Potash Project.\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker is the CEO Graham Clarke, reporting to the Board of Directors.\n2.7.\nFinancial instruments\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another.\n(a) Financial assets\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial assets are classified at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"), or fair value through profit and loss.\nThe classification of financial assets at initial recognition that are debt instruments depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's business model for managing them. The Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.\nIn order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest (\"SPPI\")' on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\nThe Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.\nSubsequent measurement\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\n\u00b7\nFinancial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)\n\u00b7\nFinancial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)\n\u00b7\nFinancial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments)\n\u00b7\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)\nThis category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\u00b7\nThe financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\u00b7\nThe contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate (\"EIR\") method and are subject to impairment. Interest received is recognised as part of finance income in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. The Group's financial assets at amortised cost include trade receivables (not subject to provisional pricing) and other receivables.\nDerecognition\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group's consolidated statement of financial position) when:\n\u00b7\nThe rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n\u00b7\nThe Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement\u037e and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (\"ECLs\") for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit and loss. For trade receivables (not subject to provisional pricing) and other receivables due in less than 12 months, the Group applies the simplified approach in calculating ECLs, as permitted by IFRS 9. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead, recognises a loss allowance based on the financial asset's lifetime ECL at each reporting date.\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group.\nA financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows and usually occurs when past due for more than one year and not subject to enforcement activity. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n(b) Financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans.\nSubsequent measurement\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\u00b7\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings and trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. This category generally applies to trade and other payables.\nDerecognition\nA financial liability is derecognised when the associated obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.\nWhen an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\n2.8.\nTaxation\nCurrent taxes are based on the results shown in the financial statements and are calculated according to local tax rules, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, determined using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset or liability is realised or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n2.9.\nIntangible assets - exploration and evaluation expenditure\nExploration expenditure comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the exploration of a project area and research costs.\nWhen it has been established that a mineral deposit has development potential and the Group has the rights to explore, all costs (direct and applicable overheads) incurred in connection with the exploration and development of the mineral deposits are capitalised until either production commences, or the project is not considered economically viable.\nIn the event of production commencing, capitalised costs in respect of the asset are transferred into Tangible Fixed Assets, and are depreciated over the expected life of the mineral reserves on a unit of production basis. Other pre-trading expenses are written off as incurred.\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, intangible assets are allocated to specific projects with each licence and reviewed annually. Where a project is abandoned or is considered to be of no further interest, the related costs are written off.\nIntangible assets are subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, where indicators of impairment are considered to be present in accordance with IFRS 6. The recoverability of all exploration costs, licenses and mineral resources is dependent on the ability of the Group to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of reserves and future profitable production, or proceeds from the disposition thereof.\nExpenditure on research and development, such as for the KMP, including testwork and patent applications, is recognised as an intangible asset under IAS 38 once both the technical and economic viability of such research can be demonstrated. Until that time, costs are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalised intellectual property costs will be amortised over their economic life, once that period has been realistically established.\n2.10.\nContingent assets\nContingent assets are assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Contingent assets are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefit is probable.\n2.11.\nContingent liabilities\nA contingent liability is a possible or present obligation that does not meet the criteria for recognising in the accounts because it is either:\na) A possible obligation (i.e. one not yet confirmed to actually be a present obligation, with any degree of certainty) that arises from past events and where the final outcome will be contingent on one or more uncertain future events, not wholly within the control of the entity; or\nb) A present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because the loss is not probable or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n2.12.\nCash and cash equivalents\nFor the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand and deposits held at call with financial institutions.\n2.13.\nForeign currencies\nAssets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into US$ at the rates of exchange ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.\nOn consolidation of a foreign operation, assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the Statement of Financial Position. Income and expenses for each Statement of Comprehensive Income presented are translated at average exchange rates. All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.\n2.14.\nShare-based payment arrangements\nThe Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of share options are recognised as an expense. The total expense to be apportioned over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:\n\u00b7\nincluding any market performance conditions;\n\u00b7\nexcluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and\n\u00b7\nincluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.\nAny non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest.\nThe Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\nWhen options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.\nThe fair value of goods or services received in exchange for shares is recognised as an expense and included within administrative expenses.\n2.15.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with UK-IAS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed below:\na) Recoverability of intangible assets\nThe Group tests annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that the intangible assets might be impaired.\nIFRS 6 requires entities recognising exploration and evaluation assets to perform an impairment test on those assets when specific facts and circumstances indicate an impairment test is required. The assessment involves judgement as to the status of licenses and the likelihood of renewal of exploration licenses which expire in the near future. Where impairment indicators are present, the Group is required to evaluate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.\nThe Directors therefore undertook an assessment of the following areas and circumstances that could indicate the existence of impairment in accordance with IFRS 6:\n\u00b7\nThe Group's right to explore in an area has expired, or will expire in the near future without renewal;\n\u00b7\nNo further exploration or evaluation is planned or budgeted for;\n\u00b7\nA decision has been taken by the Board to discontinue exploration and evaluation in an area due to the absence of a commercial level of reserves; or\n\u00b7\nSufficient data exists to indicate that the book value will not be fully recovered from future development and production.\nIn October 2024, the Company received the news that its ESIA application had been rejected and that no further appeals could be made. The Company believes that this decision, and its treatment over the preceding years by the Moroccan authorities, to have been contrary to its legal rights, and has thus initiated a dispute in this matter.\nNotwithstanding the Board's confidence in its position, and the expectation that this dispute will be resolved in a positive way (whether through an amicable settlement or through litigation), the final rejection of the ESIA represents a clear indicator of impairment in the context of several of the criteria under IFRS 6, and accordingly the Company has recognised an impairment provision of US$20.4 million, the full carrying value of the Fixed Assets in respect of the Khemisset Project, at the time of the rejection.\nFollowing this impairment, the carrying value of Group's exploration and evaluation intangible assets in relation to the Khemisset Project at 31 December 2024 was US$nil (2023: US$20.4 million).\nb) Share-based payments\nThe Group has made awards of options on its unissued share capital to certain Directors and employees as part of their remuneration package.\nThe valuation of these options involved making a number of critical estimates relating to price volatility, future dividend yields, expected life of the options and interest rates. These assumptions are described in more detail in note 13.\nThere was a charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income during the year in relation to share based payments of US$270k (2023: US$335k).\n3.

In prior years, a large portion of costs in Morocco related to the development of the Khemisset project and had therefore been capitalised in accordance with the Company's policies.\n4.

Emmerson PLC is registered for taxation in the United Kingdom, where the corporation tax rate was 19%. Morocco has a 20% tax rate applicable to mining companies, including Emmerson's Moroccan subsidiaries, while the British Virgin Islands have a tax rate of 0%.\nA deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of deductible temporary differences relating to certain losses carried forward at the year end, as there is insufficient evidence that taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.\nThe unrecognised deferred tax asset for the Group was approximately US$6,154k (2023: US$2,361k). The unrecognised deferred tax asset relating to Moroccan tax losses amounted to approximately US$2,004k (2023: US$97k).\n6. Earnings per share\nThe calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:\n2024\n2023\nLoss from continuing operations for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company (US$'000)\n(25,770)\n(2,992)\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share\n1,111,428,463\n1,021,272,676\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n2.319 cents\n0.293 cents\nThe potential number of shares which could be issued following the exercise of options and warrants currently outstanding amounts to 114,352,743 (see note 13).\nDilutive earnings per share equals basic earnings per share as, due to the losses incurred, there is no dilutive effect from the existing share options and warrants.\n7.

Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Other payables consist of supplier invoices for administration expenses.\nIncluded on Other payables are $73,000 which relates to the legal settlement agreement, please see note 10.\n10. Long-term liabilities\nOn 30 April 2025, the Company reached a legal settlement agreement related to a contract dated 29 November 2021 to which the consultant agreed to provide a basic engineering package for the Company's Khemisset Potash Project.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Company has recognised long-term liabilities related to the legal settlement obligations as follows:\nDescription\nPayment Due Date\nUS$'000\nFirst payment*\nPaid June 2025\n73\nSecond Payment\n27 May 2026\n165\nThird Payment\n27 May 2027\n189\nTotal\n427\n\\* The first payment of $73,000 is included within the trade and other payables due to the payment being required within a year from the year end.\n11.

In common with all other businesses, the Company is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the Company's objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout this financial information.\nGeneral objectives, policies and processes\nThe Directors have overall responsibility for the determination of the Company's risk management objectives and policies. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:\nCapital management\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Directors reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As a part of this review, the Directors consider the cost of capital, the risks associated with each class of capital and overall capital structure risk management through the new share issues and share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.\nCredit risk\nThe Company's credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating \"A\" are accepted.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk arises from the Directors' management of working capital. It is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.\nThe Directors' policy is to ensure that the Company will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. To achieve this aim, the Directors seek to maintain a cash balance sufficient to meet expected requirements.\nThe Directors have prepared cash flow projections on a monthly basis through\nto\n31 December 2026. At the end of the period under review, these projections indicated that the Group is expected to have sufficient liquid resources\nto continue in operational existence and\nmeet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.\nForeign exchange risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. However since the Company's strategy changed from developing the Khemisset project to pursuing a dispute with the Moroccan authorities, the exposure to forex risk has reduced significantly and is now limited to cash balances and outgoings in GBP.\n12. Share capital\nThe Ordinary Shares issued by the Company have no par value and are fully paid. Each Ordinary Share carries one vote on a poll vote.\nThe Company does not have a limited amount of authorised capital.\nNumber of shares\nUS$'000\nAs at 1 January 2024\n1,026,743,224\n34,958\nShare issued - cash received in year\n163,892,203\n2,894\nShares issued - cash received after year end\n79,230,768\n645\nShare awards issued to management\n12,000,000\n90\nShare issue costs\n-\n(123)\nAs at 31 December 2024\n1,281,866,195\n38,464\nIn April 2024, the Company allotted 112 million shares at a price of 1.75 pence per share, raising net proceeds of US$2.4 million.
