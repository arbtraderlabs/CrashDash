A number of important\nissues\nthat had held up progress\nhave been\nresolved\n, and discussions have moved onto the specifics of the Project's water management, which is a key area of concern in Morocco following low rainfall in recent years.\nO\nur proposals (including specific revisions) are robust and\nI am cautious\nly optimistic they\nwill be accepted, but\nthe timing of approvals is in the hands of the Moroccan authorities\n. We appreciate the patience of our shareholders and are committed to doing everything that is needed to get this over the line\n.\n\"\nWork in other are\nas has continued. Our technical workstreams (which of course include key elements relevant to water management such as sourcing water and tailings facilities) are now nearing completion, and we were also able to sign MOUs for around 2/3rd\ns\nof our potash production\non a take or pay basis\n, demonstrating the strength of demand for potash. Discussions with financiers continue, and we will provide updates at the appropriate times, although understandably the environmental approvals will unlock p\nrogress\n,\nparticularly on the equity side.\n\"\nI am confident we will be able to provide some substantive updates over\nthe course of\nQ1,\nand that\n2023\nwill be\na transformative year for Emmerson\n.\n\"\nEnvironmental permit\nThe Company's priority is to secure the necessary environmental approvals from the Moroccan authorities for the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or \"the Project\"). As Khemisset will be the first potash mine in Morocco, the authorities have sought to ensure that all aspects of the Project comply with the highest standards. This process is iterative, and has taken time, and the Company is aware of the frustration felt by shareholders over its inability to provide firm deadlines, or detailed commentaries. To a large extent, this is in the nature of such processes.\nThe Company has always emphasised the economic benefits of the Project to local communities, as well as the strategic importance of building a new source of potash in Morocco. These aspects have been widely acknowledged, and the Project has received significant support both in Morocco and in the UK.\nOver the course of 2022, the Company has been able to address a number of the wider issues relating to the Project, in particular its potential impact on local and neighbouring communities and businesses. Discussions have progressed more specifically onto matters concerning the Project's water management.\nForemost among these is the confirmation of the capacity to use recycled water from the Khemisset Waste Water Treatment Plant, instead of drawing freshwater direct from the Ouljet Essoltane Dam. This revision, developed in conjunction with Reminex SA, significantly mitigates risks around water supply levels during dry periods.\nThe Company has also determined that a dry tailings system will now be employed at Khemisset to reduce water consumption and essentially eliminate any risk of saline fluid outflow in the event of an extreme rainfall event. Such tailings storage facilities are in use at various potash operations around the world.\nThe finer technical details of the above, and other specific areas, continue to be reviewed by the environmental and water agencies. These proposals are in line with Emmerson's determination, as a responsible investor, to pursue the highest environmental standards in everything that we do at Khemisset. The Company is working through these solutions with the relevant government departments to ensure they are acceptable to all stakeholders, although the timing of final approvals is in the hands of the Moroccan authorities.\nTechnical Workstreams\nBasic Engineering workstreams have substantially progressed during the period. Design of the processing plant by US-based Barr Engineering is now 90% complete, and infrastructure design undertaken by the Moroccan firm Reminex SA is 80% complete. Both streams will be completed within Q1 2023 in readiness for financier due diligence and the transition into project execution.\nTraffic studies for the proposed highway interchange and the overall logistics model for transporting the final product from the mine site to the ports of Casablanca, undertaken by the Moroccan consultants Novec SA, have also been progressed to support both the wider Basic Engineering streams and the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (\"ESIA\") submission.\nWhile the Company continues to advance its strategy regarding renewable energy as part of its sustainability commitment, binding agreements for both the 225Kv and 22Kv powerlines have been signed with the Moroccan grid operator, Office National de l'Electricit\u00e9 et de l'Eau Potable (''ONEE''). The 22Kv line will be utilised as construction phase power before being converted to its primary purpose as contingency power for the production phase, which will be powered by the 225Kv supply.\nElectrical Resistance Tomography (\"ERT\") results from the most recent exploration campaign have provided a sensible basis for finalising the mine site location, precise siting of key infrastructure (portal, declines and processing facility) and adapting the design to in-situ rock competence for site wide foundations.\nOther technical details have been further de-risked in partnership with globally renowned subject matter experts. Cuttability testing has been completed on core samples obtained from the most recent exploration campaign in Komatsu laboratories, confirming adequacy of continuous miners for both underground workings and development of the access declines. Howden have been instrumental in progressing the ventilation model for the decline and the mine, enabling development of underground mine planning, final sizing of declines, and surface equipment specification, sizing and location.\nPotash and Salt MOUs\nIn November, the Company announced the signing of non-binding MOUs relating to the offtake of potash and salt to be produced at Khemisset, as follows:\n\u00b7\nWith Keytrade AG for the sale of a minimum of 245,000 metric tonnes per year of MOP for a period of 10 years; and\n\u00b7\nWith Hexagon Group AG for the sale of a minimum of 245,000 metric tonnes per year of MOP and a minimum of 500,000 metric tonnes per year of salt product (\"NaCl\"), both for a period of 10 years.\nImportantly, the MOUs contemplate \"take or pay\" provisions whereby the off-takers will market the product to end users and compensate the Company for any quantities not taken by end users or otherwise sold by the off-takers.\nThe MOUs are non-exclusive, and Emmerson will continue to engage in ongoing offtake discussions with other wholesale customers, distributors, and global traders for the remaining production capacity from Khemisset.\nThese initial offtake MOUs represent a material development for Emmerson and underpin an adequate proportion of future potash and salt sales to satisfy the banks. The Board believes that this is a strong endorsement for the Project, de-risking the financing.\nFinancing update\nThe Company\nis now finalising the first stage of\nsecuring the\nbank\nfunding needed to bring the\nP\nroject into construction\n. As previously noted,\ns\ntrong expressions of interest have been received from international and Moroccan lending banks, as well as development financial institutions and other financing counterparties, to underpin an attractive construction financing package. Updates in this matter will be provided in due course.\nGlobal potash market outlook\nPotash prices rose sharply in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine, and the imposition of sanctions on both Russia and Belarus, who together account for approximately 40% of global potash production. By the end of the year, prices had fallen back somewhat, following a short-term drop in demand due to high prices and dry weather, but remain well above historic levels.\nIn the near-term, the market for agricultural produce such as grain, oilseed, and soya, are expected to be tight, leading to sustained high prices for those commodities as well as fertilisers such as potash. Longer term, the growing global population and the transition to more resource-intensive diets, combined with scarcity of cultivatable land, will lead to an increasing use of fertilisers to improve yields. Because the continent of Africa will have the highest population growth of all, it will also have the greatest need for increased food production. Khemisset, which is expected to be the first commercial potash mine on the continent in almost 50 years, is therefore important due to geography, as well as in the context of worldwide potash demand.\nAppointment of Nominated Adviser\nOn 3 January 2023, the Company announced the appointment of Liberum Capital as\nNominated Adviso\nr\n, enhancing our relationship with them following their appointment as Joint Corporate Broker to the Company in February 2022.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Jim Wynn / Charles Vaughan\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nLiberum Capital Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / William King\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nShard Capital (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\n+44 (0)20 7186 9927\nSt Brides Partners (Financial PR/IR)\nSusie Geliher / Charlotte Page\n+44 (0)20 7236 1177\nNotes to Editors\nEmmerson is focused on advancing the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or the \"Project\") in Morocco into a low cost, high margin supplier of potash, and the only primary producer on the African continent. With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking second in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts, and the spot price for granular MOP fertiliser has since risen, further enhancing the valuations.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This Committee was unable to meet during the second half of 2023. The Company understands that this was a result of a number of matters taking priority at governmental level, not least the co-ordination of relief efforts related to the earthquake in September 2023.\nThe Company continues to lobby to ensure this meeting takes place as soon as possible, and that its application will be considered favourably, while at all times respecting due protocols and procedures.\nThe Company has repeatedly been assured that the meeting will take place soon, and that no further significant issues remain. However, the timing of the meeting and its outcomes are not within the Company's control. Any substantive updates on the approval process will be reported without delay.\nBank Mandates\nIn December 2023, the Company announced the extension of the appointment of a syndicate of leading international and Moroccan banks as initial mandated lead arrangers (\"MLAs\") to co-ordinate and fund dual-tranche debt financing facilities for the development of the Project for a further 12 months until 31 December 2024.\nThe debt facility under discussion amounts to US$310 million, including an ECA-covered tranche of US$230 million supported by UK Export Finance, and a dual currency (US$ and Moroccan Dirham) commercial tranche of\u00a0US$80 million.\nThe extension of the mandates demonstrates the ongoing support for the Khemisset Project by the syndicate.\nOther Workstreams\nThe basic engineering workstreams for the Khemisset Project are now at the stage where only the final documents are expected. No further exploration or engineering work in respect of the basic design is being undertaken pending the ESIA approval.\nSeparately, the Company has continued to examine process design and optimisations with a specific focus on improving the Project's environmental footprint, which also offer considerable economic upside. Details of these enhancements are being finalised and will be announced in due course.\nChief Executive Graham Clarke\nsaid:\n\"\nThe final quarter of 2023 has been frustrating in that we continue to await the session of the Ministerial Committee, which is the next step towards the approval of our environmental permit. Discussions with various parties and advisors have continued to be positive, offering understanding for our frustration while explaining that governmental attention has been focused on various other matters. We believe the matter will be dealt with soon, based on feedback, but we are unable to provide any confirmed dates as the matter is in the hands of the government.\n\"The extension of the bank mandates was a positive development, and a reminder of the fact that we continue to enjoy the support of international and Moroccan banks, the UK government (both through UK Export Finance and the work of the British Embassy in Rabat), and our largest shareholder Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd.\n\"While we have been continuing with our lobbying activities, we have limited our technical activities appropriately in order to preserve the Company's cash for as long as possible, although some important work has been undertaken to examine opportunities for further optimising and enhancing the project economically and more importantly, environmentally.\n\"Once we have the ESIA approval, we will be in a position to move forward quickly with fundraising and technical work. We will of course provide updates as soon as we are able in all these matters.\n\"In the meantime, I am grateful to our shareholders for their continued support, particularly in the context of unforgiving market conditions.\n\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Jim Wynn / Charles Vaughan\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nLiberum Capital Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Matthew Hogg / Kane Collings\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nShard Capital (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\n+44 (0)20 7186 9927\nBlytheRay (Financial PR and IR)\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray / Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNotes to Editors\nEmmerson is focused on advancing the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or the \"Project\") in Morocco into a low cost, high margin supplier of potash, and the first primary producer on the African continent.

With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts..\nThis announcement should be read in its entirety.

With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts.\nThis announcement should be read in its entirety.

          "content": "8 Apr 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 5900J\nEmmerson PLC\n08 April 2024\nEmmerson PLC / Ticker: EML / Index: AIM / Sector: Mining\n8 April 2024\nEmmerson PLC\n(\"Emmerson\" or the \"Company\")\nQ1 2024 update, US$2.175 million Equity Placing with Strategic Investors & Retail Offering\nEmmerson, the Moroccan focused potash development company, is pleased to provide an update on its activities in Q1 2024 in relation to its 100% owned Khemisset Potash Project (\"\nKhemisset\n\" or the \"\nProject\n\"), and has announced it has raised US$2.175 million from the issuance of new ordinary shares (\"\nShares\n\") to its strategic investors. In addition, the Company will shortly launch a retail offer to existing shareholders on the REX platform.\nQ1 2024 update\nEnvironmental approval\nOn 11 March 2024, the Company announced that the\nCommission Minist\u00e9rielle de Pilotage\n(\"Ministerial Committee\" or the \"Committee\"), to whom the Company referred the decision of the\nCommission R\u00e9gionale Unifi\u00e9e d'Investissement\n(\"\nCRUI\n\") regarding the Project's environmental approval in July 2023, had upheld the Company's referral and asked that the matter be returned to the CRUI for reconsideration.\nAs part of this, the Committee invited the Company to resubmit an Environmental Impact Assessment (\"\nEIA\n\"), including any environmental optimisations. The Company and its consultants have therefore been preparing a revised EIA to address the concerns previously raised by the CRUI including the improvements arising from the Khemisset Multi-mineral Process (\"\nKMP\n\"), and this document will be submitted in the coming days.\nThe Company believes that the improvements resulting from the incorporation of the KMP into the design, notably the reduction in water consumption and the elimination of brine disposal, are considerable, and address the major concerns related to water identified by the CRUI. Whilst the Company considers that its previous EIA was adequate and met all relevant criteria required by the CRUI and other relevant authorities, it is excited to introduce its new proprietary KMP technology into the development of the Project.\nThe CRUI is expected to review the EIA submission, particularly focusing on the amendments, over the coming weeks, and any updates will be announced in due course.\nKMP\nOn 1 February 2024, the Company announced that it had completed a scoping study on a new processing route known as KMP. Full details of the benefits of KMP can be found in the announcement from that date which is available\nhere\n.\nUS$2.175 million subscription with GSM and GQC\nEmmerson is pleased to announce that it has entered into a subscription agreement with Global Sustainable Minerals Pte Ltd (\"\nGSM\n\") and Gold Quay Capital Pte Ltd (\"\nGQC\n\")\n(together the \"\nStrategic Investors\n\"), whereby GSM will subscribe for US$2.0 million of new Shares and GQC will subscribe for US$175k of new Shares, at a placing price of 1.75 pence\nper Share (the\n\"Placing Price\n\")\n. The Placing Price represents a discount of 16.4% to the Company's 5-day VWAP of 2.09 pence.\nPursuant to legally binding subscription agreements, GSM has subscribed for 90,702,948 Shares and GQC has subscribed for 7,936,508 Shares at the Placing Price (the \"\nSubscriptions\n\"). On completion of the Subscriptions, GSM and GQC will be beneficially interested in 20.30% and 2.64% respectively of the Company's issued share capital.\nIn addition, the Strategic Investors will receive a warrant to subscribe for new Shares (\"\nWarrants\n\") for each Share subscribed for pursuant to the Subscription Agreements. The Warrants have an exercise price of 3 pence and an expiry date of 31 December 2024.\nGSM Board Seat\nOn completion of the Subscriptions, and as a result of its shareholding exceeding 20%, GSM will have the right to appoint a representative to Emmerson's board of directors, under the terms of the relationship agreement signed in November 2021 between the Company and GSM. GSM have indicated to Emmerson that they intend to exercise this right and details of any appointment, which will be subject to the usual regulatory approvals, will be announced in due course.\nUse of proceeds\nThe funds will be utilized by the Company to advance its studies in respect of KMP towards feasibility level alongside the progression of the EIA process in Morocco, as well as for general working capital requirements.\nRetail Offer on REX platform\nTo enable the Company's existing shareholders to participate at the same Placing Price, the Company intends to make an offer of Shares at a price of 1.75 pence per Share available on the\u00a0REX platform (the\u00a0\"\nRetail\u00a0Offer\n\"). The Retail Offer will be the subject of a separate announcement to be made shortly.\nGraham Clarke, CEO of Emmerson commented:\n\"\nFollowing the news last month that the Ministerial Committee had upheld the referral of our environmental approval, we have been working to update the EIA to incorporate the various improvements that the KMP has enabled. While we maintain the previous EIA submission was adequate, we believe this, in addition to the previous optimisations, makes the revised EIA even more environmentally robust, and addresses all material concerns related to water that have been raised in the past.\n\"The US$2.175 million subscription with our Strategic Investors is a sign of their continued support for the Project. In September 2023, we announced to the market that the original funding agreement from 2021 was no longer suitable, and had been allowed to expire, but that GSM, as our largest shareholder, remained supportive. By providing this additional funding alongside GQC, even ahead of environmental approval, GSM has demonstrated their confidence in the Project, and particularly in the advantages of the KMP.\n\"This cornerstone funding has strengthened our balance sheet, thus allowing us to continue our work advancing the KMP towards Feasibility Level, while we work with the authorities to obtain the approval for the EIA. We are also pleased to offer shares at the same placing price to existing investors via the REX platform, should they wish to participate.\n\"Khemisset is a world-class potash project, but with the addition of the KMP processing route, it represents a truly unique multi-nutrient producer. By offering a full suite of fertilisers containing potash, phosphates, and nitrogen, as well as magnesium and iron, all from a single deposit, it represents a solution to the challenges of food security and African self-reliance, unlike any other mine in the world.\"\nMark Zhou, CEO of GSM, said\n:\n\"We are delighted to be able to demonstrate our commitment to Khemisset, which we believe is an outstanding project. We look forward to working even more closely with the Emmerson team in the future.\"\nAdmission of Shares\nApplication will be made for the Shares issued pursuant to the Subscriptions and those Shares to be issued pursuant to the Retail Offer (together the \"\nFundraising Shares\n\") to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). Admission is expected to occur at\n8.00 a.m. on 22 April 2024\n. The Fundraising Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing issued Shares.\nThe Company will provide an update as to Total Voting Rights, and to confirm the timing of Admission, following the completion of the Retail Offer.\nRelated Party Transaction\nBy nature of the Substantial Shareholding (as defined by the AIM Rules for Companies) in the Company, GSM's participation in the Subscriptions constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of the AIM Rules for Companies. The directors consider, having consulted with Liberum, the Company's nominated adviser, that the terms of the Subscription are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0Market Abuse Regulation and the Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information, please visit\nwww.emmersonplc.com\n, follow us on Twitter (@emmerson_plc), or contact:\nEmmerson PLC\nGraham Clarke / Jim Wynn / Charles Vaughan\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nLiberum Capital Limited (Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker)\nScott Mathieson / Matthew Hogg\n+44 (0)20 3100 2000\nShard Capital (Joint Broker)\nDamon Heath / Isabella Pierre\n+44 (0)20 7186 9927\nBlytheRay (Financial PR and IR)\nTim Blythe / Megan Ray / Said Izagaren\n+44 (0) 207 138 3204\nNotes to Editors\nEmmerson is focused on advancing the Khemisset project (\"Khemisset\" or the \"Project\") in Morocco into a low cost, high margin supplier of potash, and the first primary producer on the African continent. With an initial 19-year life of mine, the development of Khemisset is expected to deliver long-term investment and financial contributions to Morocco including the creation of permanent employment, taxation, and a plethora of ancillary benefits. As a UK-Moroccan partnership, the Company is committed to bringing in significant international investment over the life of the mine.\nMorocco is widely recognised as one of the leading phosphate producers globally, ranking third in the world in terms of tonnes produced annually, and the development of this mine is set to consolidate its position as the most important fertiliser producer in Africa. The Project has a large JORC Resource Estimate (2012) of 537Mt @ 9.24% K2O, with significant exploration potential, and is perfectly located to support the expected growth of African fertiliser consumption whilst also being located on the doorstep of European markets. The need to feed the world's rapidly increasing population is driving demand for potash and Khemisset is well placed to benefit from the opportunities this presents. The Feasibility Study released in June 2020 indicated the Project has the potential to be among the lowest capital cost development stage potash projects in the world and also, as a result of its location, one of the highest margin projects. This delivered outstanding economics, including a post-tax NPV8 of approximately US$1.4 billion using industry expert Argus' price forecasts.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
