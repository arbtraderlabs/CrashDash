(\u201cVEUSA\u201d), a Texas corporation, has been incorporated.\nIn parallel with completion of the Financing Discussions, the Company, through VEUSA, has also incorporated Eco Oil Disposal, LLC (\u201cEco Oil\u201d), an Oklahoma limited liability company, for the purposes of restructuring its relationship with, and economic interest in, the reclamation business, JKT Reclamation, LLC (\u201cJKT\u201d) in Wilson, Oklahoma. The Company expects that the restructuring of matters related to its interest in the reclamation business will be concluded contemporaneously with the Financing Discussions.\nOperationally, JKT has seen substantial improvement in the second half of 2025. Mr. Freddy Nixon has been appointed as the manager of the Wilson, Oklahoma facility and will be appointed Chief Executive Officer of Eco Oil from 1 January 2026. Under the leadership of Mr. Nixon, the facility has averaged approximately US$71,000 per month of revenue for the five month period July 2025 to November 2025 versus approximately US$30,000 per month in 2024 (excluding months in which the facility was shut-down for operational and technical repairs).\nIn the announcement on 2 October 2025, the Company advised that it was carefully monitoring its cash position, following low levels of cash flow, and as such, limited funds being returned to the Company by its investee companies in order to\nsupport the Company\u2019s ongoing operations. Although the Board of the Company remains confident regarding the Financing Discussions, there is no certainty that these will materialise, and in this instance the Board will need to carefully consider the Company\u2019s financial position and solvency. As such the Board of the Company continues to explore additional structured solutions and will continue to hold discussions with key stakeholders to manage the financial position of the Company.\nAdditionally, further to the above and to the announcement of 2 October 2025, the Company announces it now expects to be in a position to publish its Annual Report and Financial Statements for its financial year ended 31 December 2024 (\"2024 Annual Report\") and its Half-year report for the six months ended 30 June 2025 (\"2025 Half-year Report\") by 31 January 2026.\nPursuant to Rule 19 of the AIM Rules for Companies, trading in the Company's ordinary shares on AIM will remain suspended pending publication of its 2024 Annual Report and its 2025 Half-year Report.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The proceeds of the Swap Agreement, approximately\nUS$223,000\n, which were received on\n30 September 2025\n, will be used by JKT to continue to develop the reclamation operations at the site and the Company expects to provide further updates on JKT\u2019s development as the funds are deployed.\nThe Company has a 41.4% economic interest in JKT Reclamation, LLC, through its subsidiary ADM Energy (\nUSA\n), Inc.\nIn\nMarch 2025\n, the Company raised \u00a3587,000 via a Subscription and Broker Option, which was used to provide further capital to increase the Company\u2019s interest in its portfolio of investments, including JKT and the Altoona\nLease in\nKern County, California\n.\nDespite the positive progress made by its investee companies and the recent funding being sourced by the Swap Agreement for JKT, limited funds are being returned to the Company to support its ongoing operations and the Company\u2019s working capital remains very constrained as previously announced.\nSince this fundraise,\nthe Board has been carefully managing the Company\u2019s working capital while it explores longer-term structured solutions. It has reduced creditor liabilities and remains in discussions with key stakeholders to manage the financial position of the Company. Further, the Company is in continued discussions with an interested party in relation to further funding of its investee companies, and at the PLC level. However, in the event that these discussions do not progress, the Board will need to carefully consider the company\u2019s financial position and solvency.\nDelay to the Publication of 2024 Annual Results and 2025\nHalf-year Report\nFurther to the announcement made on\n1 July 2025\n, the Company announces that it anticipates being able to publish its Annual Report and Financial Statements for its financial year ended\n31 December 2024\n(\"2024 Annual Report\") and its Half-year Report for the six months ended\n30 June 2025\n(\"2025 Half-year Report\") by\n31 December 2025\n.\nAs announced previously, pursuant to Rule 19 of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"), the Company was required to publish its 2024 Annual Report by\n30 June 2025\nand its 2025 Half-year Report by\n30 September 2025\n.

The purchase of the lease includes in-place equipment and infrastructure including five new pump jacks and a new 150-barrel storage tank.\nFirst Production at the Lease\nFollowing completion of the investment, the SPI-1 well was put into production on 18 April 2025. As of 16 May 2025, the SPI-1 well has now produced approximately 90 barrels of oil or an average of approximately 3 barrels per day.\nThe SPI-1 well was originally drilled in\n2004\nto a depth of 2,434 feet and, it is the Company's understanding, that the well was drilled using water-based mud (in place of oil-based mud).\nDue to the presence of expandable clays in the formation and suggested formation damage caused by the use of water-based mud, it is believed that the SPI-1 well is not capable of producing at typical rates that otherwise would be achievable. However, as the SPI-1 well is the only well on the Altoona Lease that was drilled to a depth exceeding 2,000 feet, the Company is pleased that the well is producing oil and believes that evidence of production from this well is highly encouraging and a supportive data point for the Company's plan to deepen two further wells (using oil-based mud) in order to test deeper production that may be contributing to the positive results realised in adjected leases by Chevron (USA).\nFurther Development Plans\nAs stated in the announcement on 17 April 2025, VOG and the Lease partners intend to bring up to 11 of the available well bores (including the SPI-1) into production (the \"\nPhase 1\n\" work program). The initial US$150,000 of the US$750,000 total sum from the farm-out consortium has been escrowed and will be used to fund the remainder of Phase 1. VOG is currently working with its partners to plan Phase 2 of the work program which will consist of the deepening of two wells in order to test deeper potential pay zones that are also currently producing in a neighbouring lease that is operated by Chevron (USA). As noted in the announcement on 17 April 2025, the remaining US$600,000 has been deposited into escrow and will be released upon completion of necessary pre-drill regulatory and technical work, and will be utilised to facilitate Phase 2.\nAn updated investor presentation containing information on the Company's portfolio of investments will be made available in due course and will be posted on the Company's website.\nDebt Settlement\nThe Company announces that it has agreed to settle an outstanding amount owned to a creditor, representing in aggregate approximately \u00a337,697.50, via the issue of 37,697,500 new ordinary shares of 0.001 pence (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") at the issue price of 0.1 pence per new Ordinary Share (\"\nDebt Settlement Shares\n\").\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made for the 37,697,500 Debt Settlement Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM which is expected to occur on or around 23 May 2025 (\"\nAdmission\n\"). The Debt Settlement Shares will rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the ordinary shares of the Company currently traded on AIM.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued share capital will comprise 1,726,874,644 ordinary shares of 0.001 pence each. This number will represent the total voting rights in the Company and may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculation by which they can determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nCommenting on the recent developments within ADM's portfolio, Randall Connally, CEO, commented\n:\n\"Having returned from a trip to southern California to inspect Altoona, I am more excited than ever about the significant potential that this lease holds for the Company. The extensive infrastructure and production activity by Chevron in the immediate vicinity of Altoona is a testament to the highly prolific reservoir rock in this area. The teams are working to advance the deepening of two wells which are expected to be completed before the end of August 2025 and ADM looks forward to updating investors further in due course.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').

Chevron (USA), Inc. (\"\nChevron\n\") is actively developing leases contiguous with and surrounding the Altoona Lease. In March/April 2020 Chevron drilled and started producing the 3-8R and 3-8AR wells located approximately 250 meters from the Altoona Lease. These wells were drilled to deeper reservoir intervals at approximately 1,935 feet and combined, have produced in excess of 214,000 barrels of oil to the end of February 2025.\nA StockBox interview with ADM's CEO, Randall Connally focused on the Altoona Lease is available at\nhttps://youtu.be/TtmgtDy6vsw\n.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this announcement are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.
