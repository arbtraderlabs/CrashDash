In 2016, he was Knighted in the New Year Honours list for Parliamentary and Political Service. He sits in the House of Lords after being awarded a Life Peerage in 2020.\nIn addition to his Parliamentary career, Lord Bellingham has held five former non-executive roles for AIM companies, and this includes chairing Pathfinder Minerals plc. He is also currently chairman of four private companies. Prior to entering Parliament, Lord Bellingham practised as a barrister having graduated from Magdalene College, Cambridge with a master's degree in Law.\nThe appointment of Lord Bellingham follows the anticipated resignation, which had been planned since early 2023, of Mr. Oliver Andrews as Chairman of the Board, a position he has held since 2 August 2021. Mr. Andrews, who is resigning to focus on other endeavours, has provided steady guidance to the Board and Company during 2023 as the Company has transitioned its management team and diversified to include oil and gas assets in the USA. Additionally, Mr. Andrews has supported the Company financially, including investing US$100,000 in the Secured Convertible Loan Note announced in the RNS dated 25 May 2023.\nMr. Richard Carter, an executive director of the Company since 26 July 2016, has also resigned to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Carter has played an important role with the Company's investment in Aje as well as providing guidance to the company as it has diversified.\nThe appointment of Lord Bellingham and the resignation of Mr. Andrews is with effect from 8 November 2023 and the resignation of Mr. Carter will be with effect from 1 December 2023 to allow an orderly transition of affairs for the Company. With the resignations of Mr. Andrews and Mr. Carter, the Board will be reduced from six directors to four.\nCommenting on the Changes in Directorate:\nLord Henry Bellingham, non-executive Chairman, commented,\n\"I wish to thank Mr. Oliver Andrews and Mr. Richard Carter for their service and support to the Company, especially over the last year as the Company has transitioned to a new management team and diversified its focus. ADM has made great progress toward positioning the Company for renewed growth and it would not have been possible without the steady hands and leadership of both Mr. Andrews and Mr. Carter. I wish them both the best in their future endeavours.\nAs the Chairman of the Board of ADM, I am committed to growing ADM into a substantial energy investing company and diversifying our portfolio from an exclusive focus on upstream oil and gas assets to include initiatives in line with the energy transition and that take advantage of the substantial growth in technology spending currently being experienced by the energy industry.\"\nStefan Olivier, Chief Executive Officer, commented,\n\"I too want to thank Mr. Oliver Andrews and Mr. Richard Carter for their efforts on behalf of the Company. I have enjoyed working with both and believe they are leaving the Company in a solid position from which to execute on both our legacy and new investments.\nI fully support the appointment of Lord Bellingham as non-executive chairman and embrace his vision of expanding the scope of investments that will be included in ADM's investment portfolio.\"\nEnquiries:\nADM Energy plc\n+44 20 7459 4718\nLord Bellingham, Chairman\nwww.admenergyplc.com\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\n+44 20 7213 0880\n(Nominated Adviser)\nJo Turner, James Caithie\nHybridan LLP\n+44 20 3764 2341\n(Broker)\nClaire Louise Noyce\nODDO BHF Corporates & Markets AG\n+49 69 920540\n(Designated Sponsor)\nMichael B.

In order to focus on the Altoona lease, part of the Blade Oil V, LLC (\"Blade V\") investment announced on 25 May 2023, the Company has returned the Texas and Kansas leases included in the Blade V investment, resulting in a reduction of US$406,850 of total maximum consideration associated with the transaction including US$250,000 (circa \u00a3205,000) of the total debt reductions announced in this RNS.\nDebt Restructuring\nThe debt restructuring exercise carried out by the Company comprises the following component parts:\ni) Settlement of Certain Trade Creditors\nThe Company has entered into agreements to settle \u00a3709,280 original value of certain outstanding trade and other creditors for \u00a3369,570 of which \u00a3101,170 has been paid in cash with \u00a3147,750 remaining to be paid in installments over time and the issuance of 12,065,000 ordinary shares (the \"Settlement Shares\") resulting in a reduction of creditors of \u00a3339,710 or 48% of the original value settled (the \"Trade Creditor Settlement\").\nii) Debt restructuring with OFX Holdings, LLC\nAmendment to Blade Oil V, LLC Acquisition\nFurther to the announcement of the acquisition of Blade V on 25 May 2023, the Company has agreed with OFXH to amend the terms of the transaction in order for it to focus on developing cash generating assets as a priority. The amendments to the Blade V transaction are as follows:\na) The Company will retain the interest in the Altoona lease;\nb) The interest in the Texas and Kansas leases are reassigned to the Seller;\nc) The following adjustments are made to the Total Maximum Consideration (as defined in the RNS dated 25 May 2023):\n1. The Seller (OFX Holdings, LLC) will cancel US$250,000.00 in debt obligations owed to it by the Company;\n2. The Seller will terminate US$150,000.00 of the Contingent Payment; and,\n3. The Company and Seller have agreed to terminate 7 million 2-year, 2.5p warrants.\nAs a result of the changes to the Blade V investment, the total maximum consideration associated with the transaction reduces from US$1,614,000 to US$1,207,160. Further, given this reduction, the Company is in discussions with OFXH regarding the possible investment in a company operating in the oil and gas technology sector which the Company considers has greater short term cash generation prospects than the returned leases.\nFurther Debt Settlement of OFX Holdings, LLC Loans\nAdditionally, the Company and OFXH have agreed to discount and restructure US$275,720 of loans due to OFXH (the \"Debt Conversion Settlement\") as follows:\na) Issue 15,820,000 ordinary shares (the \"Conversion Shares\") at a nominal value of 1p per share;\nb) Issue 7,910,000 3-year, 1.5p warrants.\nThe Debt Conversion Settlement has been undertaken on the same terms as other creditor settlements and, in the event of a change to the terms of the settlement, all converting creditors will be treated equally.\nOther Disclosures Related to OFX Holdings, LLC\n\u00b7\nIn the se"

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n29 November 2023\nADM Energy PLC\n(\"ADM\" or the \"Company\")\nEnergy Technology Investment\nADM Energy PLC (AIM: ADME; BER and FSE: P4JC), a natural-resources investing company, is pleased to announce that, in line with its Investing Policy and its announcement of 14 November 2023, it has made a further investment in an energy technology company focused on providing technology solutions to the upstream sector of the U.S. oil and gas business.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nAcquisition of approximately 53.1% economic interest in OFX Technologies, LLC (\"OFXT\") 100% owner of Efficient Oilfield Solutions, LLC, a revenue generative, technology company focused on delivering technology solutions that increase efficiency, lower costs and aid in the management of regulatory requirements of the U.S. upstream oil and gas industry (\"the Investment\")\n\u00b7\nTotal Maximum Consideration of US$1,285,000 comprised of the issue of 86,035,489 new ordinary shares at 1p each; 39,959,017 3-year, 1p warrants and US$235,000 in cash.\n\u00b7\nThe Total Maximum Consideration implies a value of OFXT of approximately US$2.3 million or 4.5x the annualised monthly recurring revenue target of OFXT for the end of Q1 2024.\n\u00b7\nThis oilfield technology investment positions the Company to take advantage of the rapid growth in technology spending by the upstream industry. Barclays cited in an article from\nOilprice.com\nin April 2023 estimated upstream technology spending at US$30 billion by 2025, up over 6x from 2020 levels.\n\u00b7\nSubscription of US$225,000 of the amended Secured Convertible Loan Notes (as announced on 14 November 2023) and US$10,000 previously funded by the Company will fully fund the Company's cash commitments associated with the investment.\n\u00b7\nThe investment is consistent with the mandate of new non-executive Chairman Lord Henry Bellingham to position ADM with investments focused on technologies related to the energy industry in addition to the more traditional investments in oil and gas production that the Company has historically pursued.\nInvestment Summary\nThe Company has acquired 650,000 Class A Units of OFXT from OFX Holdings, LLC (\"OFXH\"), a substantial shareholder of the Company. In addition, the Company acquired 150,000 Class A Units in OXFT from parties unrelated to OFXH and directly subscribed for 120,000 Class A Units and 200,000 Class B Units from OFXT (together \"the Transactions\").\nThe result of the Transactions is that ADME, upon completion, will hold 920,000 Class A Units and 200,000 Class B Units of OFXT representing approximately 53.1% of the economic interest of OFXT.\nTotal consideration for the investments is US$1,285,000 comprised of (i) the issue of 86,035,489 new ordinary shares at a price of 1p per share (the \"Consideration Shares\"); (ii) US$235,000 in cash and (iii) 39,959,018 3-year, 1p warrants. The Company has the option, at its sole discretion, to purchase an additional 100,000 Class A Units at US$1.50 per Unit or US$150,000 on or before February 28, 2024. Additionally, ADM will issue a total of 16 million incentive warrants to the management team and other key persons of OFXT (the \"Incentive Warrants\").\nOf the Total consideration associated with the investment, US$975,000 is to be paid to OFXH, a substantial shareholder of the Company. OFXH will be issued 79,918,033 ordinary shares and 39,959,018 3-year, 1p warrants. Adjusted for the issuance of shares to OFXH, OFXH will hold 82,469,367 ordinary shares representing 17% of the enlarged share capital of the Company.\nConcurrent with the oilfield technology investment, ADM has accepted a subscription for US$225,000 gross proceeds of its amended 15% secured convertible loan notes with an equity conversion price of 1p per share. The Secured Convertible Loan Notes will only be issued upon funding and the proceeds will be used to fund the Company's cash commitments associated with the OFXT investment. No commissions or fees were paid in relation to the subscription which will result in net proceeds to the Company of US$235,000.\nOFX Technologies, LLC (\nwww.ofxtechnologies.com\n)\nOFXT owns 100.0% of the membership interest of Efficient Oilfield Solutions, LLC, a revenue generating Louisiana limited liability company (\"EOS\") which currently offers a free to download mobile phone app supported on both iOS and Android platforms that is used to track and manage produced water resulting from oil and gas operations and to fulfil regulatory requirements associated with the disposal of oilfield waste-water in the State of Louisiana as well as data storage requirements necessary to comply with state regulations.
