(\u201cVEUSA\u201d), a Texas corporation, has been incorporated.\nIn parallel with completion of the Financing Discussions, the Company, through VEUSA, has also incorporated Eco Oil Disposal, LLC (\u201cEco Oil\u201d), an Oklahoma limited liability company, for the purposes of restructuring its relationship with, and economic interest in, the reclamation business, JKT Reclamation, LLC (\u201cJKT\u201d) in Wilson, Oklahoma. The Company expects that the restructuring of matters related to its interest in the reclamation business will be concluded contemporaneously with the Financing Discussions.\nOperationally, JKT has seen substantial improvement in the second half of 2025. Mr. Freddy Nixon has been appointed as the manager of the Wilson, Oklahoma facility and will be appointed Chief Executive Officer of Eco Oil from 1 January 2026. Under the leadership of Mr. Nixon, the facility has averaged approximately US$71,000 per month of revenue for the five month period July 2025 to November 2025 versus approximately US$30,000 per month in 2024 (excluding months in which the facility was shut-down for operational and technical repairs).\nIn the announcement on 2 October 2025, the Company advised that it was carefully monitoring its cash position, following low levels of cash flow, and as such, limited funds being returned to the Company by its investee companies in order to\nsupport the Company\u2019s ongoing operations. Although the Board of the Company remains confident regarding the Financing Discussions, there is no certainty that these will materialise, and in this instance the Board will need to carefully consider the Company\u2019s financial position and solvency. As such the Board of the Company continues to explore additional structured solutions and will continue to hold discussions with key stakeholders to manage the financial position of the Company.\nAdditionally, further to the above and to the announcement of 2 October 2025, the Company announces it now expects to be in a position to publish its Annual Report and Financial Statements for its financial year ended 31 December 2024 (\"2024 Annual Report\") and its Half-year report for the six months ended 30 June 2025 (\"2025 Half-year Report\") by 31 January 2026.\nPursuant to Rule 19 of the AIM Rules for Companies, trading in the Company's ordinary shares on AIM will remain suspended pending publication of its 2024 Annual Report and its 2025 Half-year Report.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The proceeds of the Swap Agreement, approximately\nUS$223,000\n, which were received on\n30 September 2025\n, will be used by JKT to continue to develop the reclamation operations at the site and the Company expects to provide further updates on JKT\u2019s development as the funds are deployed.\nThe Company has a 41.4% economic interest in JKT Reclamation, LLC, through its subsidiary ADM Energy (\nUSA\n), Inc.\nIn\nMarch 2025\n, the Company raised \u00a3587,000 via a Subscription and Broker Option, which was used to provide further capital to increase the Company\u2019s interest in its portfolio of investments, including JKT and the Altoona\nLease in\nKern County, California\n.\nDespite the positive progress made by its investee companies and the recent funding being sourced by the Swap Agreement for JKT, limited funds are being returned to the Company to support its ongoing operations and the Company\u2019s working capital remains very constrained as previously announced.\nSince this fundraise,\nthe Board has been carefully managing the Company\u2019s working capital while it explores longer-term structured solutions. It has reduced creditor liabilities and remains in discussions with key stakeholders to manage the financial position of the Company. Further, the Company is in continued discussions with an interested party in relation to further funding of its investee companies, and at the PLC level. However, in the event that these discussions do not progress, the Board will need to carefully consider the company\u2019s financial position and solvency.\nDelay to the Publication of 2024 Annual Results and 2025\nHalf-year Report\nFurther to the announcement made on\n1 July 2025\n, the Company announces that it anticipates being able to publish its Annual Report and Financial Statements for its financial year ended\n31 December 2024\n(\"2024 Annual Report\") and its Half-year Report for the six months ended\n30 June 2025\n(\"2025 Half-year Report\") by\n31 December 2025\n.\nAs announced previously, pursuant to Rule 19 of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"), the Company was required to publish its 2024 Annual Report by\n30 June 2025\nand its 2025 Half-year Report by\n30 September 2025\n.
