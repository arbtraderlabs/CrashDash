With the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n7 August 2024\nSorted Group Holdings Plc\n(\"Sorted\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nInterim results for the six months ended 30 June 2024\nSorted (AIM: SORT) announces its unaudited interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2024.\nCHAIRMAN'S REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE\n2024\nDear Shareholders,\nI am pleased to present the Chairman's statement for Sorted's unaudited interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (\"H1 FY24\" or the \"Period\").\n2023 marked a significant turning point for Sorted. On 28 June 2023, we announced a secured convertible bridge loan agreement (the \"Convertible Loan Agreement\") with Sorted Holdings Limited (\"SHL\") to lend it up to \u00a32.6 million (the \"Loan\") for working capital purposes. The Convertible Loan Agreement had a redemption premium of 50% and was secured by a first fixed and floating charge over SHL's business and assets. At the Company's option, the Loan could be converted into shares representing approximately 100% of the fully diluted share capital of SHL.\nAdditionally, we simultaneously announced the entry into exclusive non-binding heads of terms for a potential acquisition of the entire issued share capital of SHL by the Company for a nominal consideration of \u00a31.00 (the \"Proposed Acquisition\"). The Proposed Acquisition constituted a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"). Accordingly, in accordance with rule 14 of the AIM Rules, the Company's ordinary shares were suspended from trading on AIM on 28 June 2023.\nOn 30 January 2024, we announced and published an AIM admission document in connection with the Proposed Acquisition. The AIM admission document detailed, among other things, the proposed acquisition of SHL, a proposed subscription of 2,285,712 new ordinary shares of 62.5 pence each in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at 87.50 pence per new Ordinary Share to raise approximately \u00a32.0 million, a proposed consolidation of every 625 existing ordinary shares of nominal value of 0.1 pence each into one new Ordinary Share, a proposed change of name and AIM ticker symbol to Sorted Group Holdings PLC and SORT respectively, director appointments, a notice of general meeting, and the restoration of trading of the Company's existing ordinary shares on AIM. Terms were agreed for the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of SHL for an aggregate nominal consideration of approximately \u00a366.73 to be paid in cash at completion.\nThe Proposed Acquisition was attractive for several reasons. This included the Proposed Acquisition being a significant opportunity to leverage SHL's technology and substantial capital investment made in SHL to date (exceeding \u00a370 million). In addition, SHL had an attractive software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") business model in the ecommerce sector with scalable, predictable revenue performance. SHL's diverse customer base of household retail brands and strong industry partnerships with the business being UK-based business with over 60 employees. Lastly, the global ecommerce market in which SHL operates has been forecast to grow significantly and is a highly fragmented market.\nOn 25 January 2024, we announced that the Company had entered into an unsecured term loan facility agreement with Bidco 3 Limited (the \"Lender\" or \"Bidco 3\") for a total principal amount of up to \u00a33.0 million (the \"Facility\"). Bidco 3 is a special purpose holding company focused on making strategic investments. The directors of the Company (the \"Directors\" or the \"Board\") believe that the Group has adequate financial resources and will not need to draw on this Facility to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nOn 16 February 2024, all resolutions were duly passed at a general meeting of the Company. The proposals set out in the AIM admission document were completed on 19 February 2024 with the enlarged group successfully admitting to trading on AIM on the same day (\"Admission\"). As part of this, Carmen Carey was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Mahmoud Warriah as Chief Financial Officer, and Petar Cvetkovic as Non-Executive Director. To reflect the Company's new name, the website changed to www.sorted.com on Admission.\nOn 30 April 2024, the Company announced that it had received approximately \u00a32.0 million in research and development (\"R&D\") tax credits from His Majesty's Revenue & Customs (\"HMRC\") (together the \"R&D Tax Credit\"). The R&D Tax Credit relates to SHL's claim made to HMRC in respect of the financial year ended 30th September 2022. The R&D Tax Credit has been directly applied towards reducing the Group's pay as you earn (\"PAYE\") and value added tax (\"VAT\") liabilities for the financial year ended 31st December 2023 and up to 29th February 2024.\nOperational and Financial Restructuring\nOn 28 May 2024, it was announced that Carmen Carey had stepped down as Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Executive Director of the Group with immediate effect, although she will continue to support the Company during a three-month notice period.\nDuring this period, we undertook significant restructuring efforts to align the business with its strategic goals and to ensure long-term sustainability, which are outlined as follows:\n\u00b7\nEmployee Headcount Reduction:\nThe headcount was reduced from 66 to 51, eliminating an expensive corporate layer that is no longer required for the business. This enabled the Board to promote the next level of high-end talent to form the new senior management team.\n\u00b7\nCost Reduction:\nWe have reduced back-office costs related to legal, HR, and finance functions, enabling management to reallocate resources towards front-office functions, specifically software engineering and sales. This is anticipated to lead to a total people cost reduction of approximately \u00a31.2 million on an annualised basis.\n\u00b7\nProperty Costs:\nWe have reorganised our offices, closing the London office and resizing the Manchester office to be more fit for purpose. This is expected to deliver an annualised six-figure saving.\n\u00b7\nOperational Efficiencies:\nWe are introducing efficiencies to run the Sorted platform more cost-effectively. Our second largest cost, outside of personnel, is our IT infrastructure, which we will focus on reducing in the second half of the financial year ending 31 December 2024 (\"FY24\").\nH1 FY24 has been transformative for our Company as we have embarked on a strategic initiative to foster a \"start-up\" mentality within our organisation. The key objectives have been to streamline our operations, reduce unnecessary corporate and executive costs, and return to our nimble roots in Manchester.\nOutlook and Future Strategy\nThroughout this period of significant change, our commitment to maintaining revenue levels and customer satisfaction has remained steadfast. I am proud to report that, despite comprehensive restructuring efforts, we have successfully upheld our revenue streams, reflecting the strength and adaptability of our team. Our customers have expressed their continued trust in our services, as evidenced by the renewal of their contracts with Sorted.\nThese changes have not only reduced costs but also enhanced our ability to respond quickly to market needs and opportunities. Specifically, we have reduced costs in back-office functions such as HR, internal IT, Finance, and Legal, as well as property and office expenses. These savings have been strategically reinvested in front-office areas, particularly in expanding our Sales team and enhancing our Software Development teams.\nWe have made significant investments in both our core team and our service offerings during this period, ensuring that we are well-positioned to capitalise on future growth opportunities. Our efforts have been geared towards fostering a culture of innovation and agility, essential for navigating the competitive landscape that we operate in as well as increasing long-term value for our shareholders.\nAs we look forward to the remainder of the financial year, we are optimistic about the future. Our strategic focus on agility, efficiency, and customer satisfaction will continue to guide us. We are confident that the steps we have taken will not only strengthen our market position but also lay a solid foundation for sustained growth and success. The acquisition of SHL and the consequential reverse takeover have provided us with a valuable platform for potential growth opportunities. Armed with this knowledge, we are actively exploring avenues for sustainable expansion and enhancement of our offerings.\nWe entered FY24 with a solid financial foundation. The successful fundraises that took place in 2024 provided us with ample resources and, together with the loan facility agreement with Bidco 3 Limited for up to \u00a33.0 million, enabled us to pursue our strategic acquisition objective against the backdrop of the complex business landscape.\nThroughout the acquisition process, we have remained committed to our key stakeholders, particularly our shareholders. We recognise that change brings uncertainty, and we have made every effort to navigate these challenges with transparency and fairness. Our team has shown remarkable resilience and adaptability during this period of transition, and we are grateful for their dedication to our shared vision.\nFinally, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our shareholders, clients, and partners for their unwavering support throughout this transformative period. Your confidence in our ability to navigate these challenges and capitalise on emerging opportunities has been instrumental in our progress.\nIn conclusion, while the previous financial year ended 31 December 2023 presented its fair share of hurdles, we are well-funded and strategically positioned for the future. With a solid financial foundation, streamlined operations, and a focus on delivering a new strategic path going forward, we are confident in our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. We thank our shareholders and stakeholders for their continued trust and support.\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Wilkinson\nExecutive Chair, Sorted Group Holdings PLC\nCONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT

THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE\n2024\n1\nGeneral\ninformation\nSorted Group Holdings PLC and its subsidiary Location Sciences AI Limited (together the \"Group\") provide a Software as a Service (SaaS) Delivery Experience Platform (DEP) that powers dynamic checkouts, delivery management and tracking globally. Through partnerships with some of the biggest global carriers and customer-obsessed retailers, Sorted transforms the delivery experience into a delight, for everyone that touches it. Sorted provides mission critical software using an application programming interface (API) driven platform that enables fast and seamless integrations with retailers offering enhanced features.\nThe Company is a public limited company which is quoted on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.\n2\nBasis of\npreparation\nThe financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee\n(\"\nIFRIC\") interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, as described in those financial statements.\nThe accounting resulting from the reverse acquisition (see notes 3 and 6) causes the comparative amounts to be restated such that the figures for the six-month period ended 30 June 2023, as well as the balance sheet as on 31 December 2023, represent those of Sorted Holdings Limited and subsidiaries (before the reverse acquisition). The results for the six-month period 30 June 2024, as well as the balance sheet as on 30 June 2024 is the same as the comparatives but also includes the balances of Sorted Group Holdings Plc and subsidiaries (before the reverse acquisition) as on 30 June 2024 and the results of the same from the acquisition date of 16 February 2024. The comparative results and balances, although largely extracted from audited results of Sorted Holdings Limited, have not been audited. The results and balances for the current period have not been subject to an audit.\nThe latest financial statements of Sorted Group Holdings Plc are those for the year ended 31 December 2023 and have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and included an unqualified auditors' report and did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or Section 498(3) Companies Act 2006. As described above, the current results are not comparable with this latest financial statements due to the reverse acquisition.\n3\nGoing concern\nThis going concern note should be read in conjunction with the note for the year ended 31 December 2023, which detailed significant events and strategic initiatives for the Company.\nOn 30 January 2024, we announced and published an AIM admission document in connection with the Proposed Acquisition. The AIM admission document detailed, among other things, the proposed acquisition of SHL, a proposed subscription of 2,285,712 new ordinary shares at 87.50 pence per share to raise approximately \u00a32.0 million, a proposed 625 to 1 share consolidation, a proposed change of name and AIM ticker symbol to Sorted Group Holdings PLC and SORT respectively, director appointments, a notice of general meeting, and the restoration of trading of the Company's existing ordinary shares on AIM. Terms were agreed for the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of SHL for an aggregate nominal consideration of approximately \u00a366.73 to be paid in cash at completion.\nThe Proposed Acquisition was attractive for several reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nSignificant opportunity to leverage Sorted's technology and substantial capital investment (exceeding \u00a370 million).\n\u00b7\nAn attractive software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") business model in the ecommerce sector with scalable, predictable revenue performance.\n\u00b7\nDiverse customer base of household retail brands and strong industry partnerships.\n\u00b7\nGlobal ecommerce market forecast to grow significantly.\n\u00b7\nHighly fragmented market.\n\u00b7\nUK-based business with over 60 employees.\nOn 25 January 2024, we announced that the Company had entered into an unsecured term loan facility agreement with Bidco 3 Limited (the \"Lender\" or \"Bidco 3\") for a total principal amount of up to \u00a33.0 million (the \"Facility\"). Bidco 3 is a special purpose holding company focused on making strategic investments. The Directors believe that the Group has adequate resources and will not need to draw on this loan to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nOn 16 February 2024, all resolutions were duly passed at a general meeting of the Company. The proposals set out in the AIM admission document were completed on 19 February 2024 with the enlarged group successfully admitting to AIM on the same day (\"Admission\"). As part of this, Carmen Carey was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Mahmoud Warriah as Chief Financial Officer, and Petar Cvetkovic as Non-Executive Director. To reflect the Company's new name, the website changed to www.sorted.com on Admission.\nOn 30 April 2024, SGH plc announced that it had received approximately \u00a32.0 million in research and development (\"R&D\") tax credits from His Majesty's Revenue & Customs (\"HMRC\"). The R&D Tax Credit relates to Sorted Group Limited's claim made to HMRC in respect of the financial year ended 30 September 2022. The R&D Tax Credit has been directly applied towards reducing the Group's pay as you earn (\"PAYE\") and value added tax (\"VAT\") liabilities for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and up to 29 February 2024.\nOn 28 May 2024, it was announced that Carmen Carey stepped down as Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Executive Director of the Group with immediate effect and will continue to support Sorted during a three-month notice period.\nDuring this period, we undertook significant restructuring efforts to align the business with its strategic goals and ensure long-term sustainability, which are outlined as follows:\n\u00b7\nEmployee Headcount Reduction:\nThe headcount was reduced from 66 to 51, eliminating an expensive corporate layer that is no longer required for the business. This enabled the Board to promote the next level of high-end talent to form the new senior management team.\n\u00b7\nCost Reduction:\nWe have reduced back-office costs related to legal, HR, and finance functions, enabling management to reallocate resources towards front-office functions, specifically software engineering and sales. This is anticipated to lead to a total people cost reduction of approximately \u00a31.2 million on an annualised basis.\n\u00b7\nProperty Costs:\nWe have reorganised our offices, closing the London office and resizing the Manchester office to be more fit for purpose. This is expected to deliver an annualised six-figure saving.\n\u00b7\nOperational Efficiencies:\nWe are introducing efficiencies to run the Sorted platform more cost-effectively. Our second largest cost, outside of personnel, is our IT infrastructure, which we will focus on reducing in the second half of the financial year ending 31 December 2024 (\"FY24\").\nThese strategic actions have been taken to streamline operations, reduce costs, and position the Company for future growth. The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow forecasts and have considered various scenarios, including the potential impacts of market conditions and the restructuring efforts.\nThe Directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the period from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025.\n4\nLoss per\nshare\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2023\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nLoss attributable to\nshareholders\n(3,434,450)\n(6,590,049)\nNo.\nNo.\nWeighted average number of shares\n(basic)\n6,704,660\n4,236,140\nThe calculation of basic loss per share of 51.2p (June 2023: 155.6p) is based on loss after taxation and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of shares for 30 June 2023 retrospectively includes the impact of the share consolidation (see note 6).\n5\nSegmental\nanalysis\nOperating segments are based on internal reports about components of the Company, which are regularly reviewed and used by the Board of Directors being the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") for strategic decision making and resource allocation, in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.\nThe segmental analysis has been restated due to the reverse acquisition (refer note 7). The comparative period is represented by two reportable segments - 'Corporate & Enterprise' and 'Return & Reverse Logistics'. With the reverse acquisition on 16 February 2024, the additional reportable segment, 'Verify', was added.\nVerify provides location verification services, utilising sophisticated machine learning and pattern recognition technologies Verify detects location ad-fraud and checks the accuracy and quality of location signals used to improve the performance of digital advertising. The Verify business was gradually scaled down beginning on February 16th, with operations progressively reduced until its full closure in June 2024. This strategic move was made to concentrate resources and focus on the Sorted Corporate and Enterprise business.\nThe corporate & enterprise segments provides a software as a service platform, the Delivery Experience Platform, that powers dynamic checkouts, delivery management and tracking globally. The segment remains stable with a successful renewal of a major client and a consistently low churn rate. This revenue stream continues to be our primary focus.\nThe return & reverse logistics segment provides software as a service platform that enables retailers of all sizes to automate their return processes and access competitively priced carrier return rates. We continue to develop the business, focusing on organic growth.\nIt should be noted that a segmental analysis of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not part of routine management reporting and, consequently, no segmental analysis of assets is shown here.\nAn analysis of operating revenue is as\nfollows:\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2023\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nVerify\n(8,057)\n-\nCorporate & Enterprise (Ship & Track)\n2,771,978\n2,785,851\nReturn & Reverse Logistics\n424,569\n491,929\n3,188,490\n3,277,780\nAn analysis of EBITDA is as\nfollows:\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2023\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nVerify\n(589,651)\n-\nCorporate & Enterprise (Ship & Track)\n(1,063,080)\n(3,683,387)\nReturn & Reverse Logistics\n60,983\n34,626\n(1,591,748)\n(3,648,761)\nAn analysis of\nprofit or\nloss before tax is as\nfollows:\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nSix\nmonths\nended\n30\nJune\n2023\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\nVerify\n(577,311)\n-\nCorporate & Enterprise (Ship & Track)\n(2,907,453)\n(6,604,189)\nReturn & Reverse Logistics\n50,559\n14,140\n(3,434,205)\n(6,590,049)\n6\nShare\ncapital\n30 June\n2024\nUnaudited\n\u00a3\n31 December\n2023\nAudited\n\u00a3\n7,639,705 ordinary shares of 62.5p each\n(December 2023: 2,647,587,398 of 0.1p each)\n4,774,815\n2,647,588\n1,040,712,398 deferred shares of 0.99p each\n10,303,053\n10,303,053\n376,651,734 New Deferred shares of 0.9p each\n3,389,866\n3,389,866\n18,467,734\n16,340,507\nShare\nissue\nShare consolidation and issue\nFollowing an announcement on 28 June 2023 where the Company entered into an exclusive non-binding heads of terms for a potential acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Sorted Holdings Limited (the \"Proposed Acquisition\"), we published an AIM admission document on 30 January 2024. This document detailed the proposed acquisition of SHL, a proposed subscription of 2,285,712 new ordinary shares at 87.50 pence per new ordinary share to raise approximately \u00a32.0 million, a proposed 625 to 1 share consolidation, a proposed change of name and AIM ticker symbol to Sorted Group Holdings PLC and SORT respectively, director appointments, a notice of general meeting, and the restoration of trading of the Company's existing ordinary shares on AIM.

The acquisition was one whereby a nominal value of \u00a366,73 was paid in cash to acquire the outstanding share capital of Sorted Holdings Limited. Consequentially, new directors were appointed, being directors and key management personnel from Sorted Holdings Limited.\nConsistent with the AIM Rules classifying this transaction as a reverse takeover, management assessed and concluded that the acquisition is, in substance, a reverse acquisition in accordance with the principles in IFRS 3. However, given that Sorted Group Holdings Plc and subsidiaries (before the acquisition) do not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3, the reverse acquisition is rather accounted for by analogy to the reverse acquisition accounting principles in IFRS 3 and the principles in IFRS 2 (as generally acceptable accounting principles exist).\nAs a result, the acquisition is accounted for such that Sorted Holdings Liming is identified as the acquirer and the net assets of Sorted Group Holdings Plc and subsidiaries (before the acquisition) deemed acquired. The consideration for the reverse acquisition is measured at the fair value of the cash transferred and the deemed consideration of the loan previously granted to Sorted Holdings Limited, which remains outstanding on 16 February 2024.\nAccordingly, the resulting balances and transactions for the periods prior to 16 February 2024 are those of Sorted Holdings Limited and subsidiaries (before the acquisition).\nThe consideration transferred is as follows:\n\u00a3\nCash\n67\nLoan previously provided\n2,516,491\n2,516,558\nThe allocation of the consideration transferred to the net assets acquired by Sorted Holdings Limited is as follows:\n\u00a3\nCash\n2,691,816\nAccounts receivable and other receivables\n178,772\nAccounts payable and accruals\n(803,086)\nListing costs expensed\n449,056\n2,516,558\n8\nAvailability of half year report\nCopies of the half-year report are available on request from the Company's registered office at Level 6 111 Piccadilly, Manchester, England, M1 2HY and can also be viewed at:\nhttps://www.sorted.com\nFor further information please contact:\nSorted Group Holdings plc\nTel: +44 (0)3300 555 284\nSimon Wilkinson, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nDavid Hart\nVivek Bhardwaj\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nJames Pope\nAndy Thacker\nAbout Sorted\nSorted's Delivery Experience supports retailers in providing exceptional delivery experiences and analysing post-purchase performance.
