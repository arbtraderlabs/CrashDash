The Company's current share price of 30 pence is below the current nominal value of 62.50 pence per ordinary share (\"\nOrdinary Share\n\"). Accordingly, in order to create a lower nominal value for each Ordinary Share, the board of directors of Sorted (the \"\nBoard\n\" or the \"\nDirectors\n\") are proposing that each existing Ordinary Share will be subdivided into one new ordinary share of 0.01 pence each (the \"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") and one deferred share of 62.49 pence each (the \"\nNew Deferred Shares\n\")\u00a0(the \"\nShare Capital Reorganisation\n\").\nEach New Ordinary Share will carry the same rights as each existing Ordinary Share under the Company's articles of association (the \"\nArticles of Association\n\"). No new certificates will be issued in relation to the existing Ordinary Shares, and the existing share certificates will remain valid entitling the registered holder to the same number of New Ordinary Shares.\nEach New Deferred Share will have very limited rights and will effectively be valueless. CREST accounts of Shareholders will not be credited in respect of any entitlement to New Deferred Shares, and no share certificates will be issued in respect of New Deferred Shares.\nThe New Deferred Shares will have the rights and restrictions as set out in the Articles of Association in respect of deferred shares, which do not entitle their holders to receive notice of or attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company or to receive a dividend or other distribution and provide the Company will the authority to transfer them at effectively nil consideration per New Deferred Share to a custodian nominated by the Company. The New Deferred Shares will not be admitted to trading on AIM or any other exchange.\nFollowing the passing of all the resolutions at the AGM, the Company will implement the Share Capital Reorganisation and make an application for admission of the 7,639,705 New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM at 8:00 a.m. on 26 September 2025.\nThe number of ordinary shares in issue, and held by each Shareholder, will not change. It is simply the nominal value of the existing Ordinary Shares which will change. Accordingly, the Share Capital Reorganisation will result in the issue of 7,639,705 New Ordinary Shares and 7,639,705 New Deferred Shares.\nThe New Ordinary Shares will continue to carry the same rights as those attached to the existing Ordinary Shares, save for the change in nominal value.

The retailer uses Sorted's 'Ship' carrier management software to integrate its carrier services across multiple distribution centres into one platform, and Sorted's 'Track' post-purchase experience software to monitor performance across in-flight shipments, enabling the retailer to own the customer delivery communication experience.\nSimon Wilkinson, Executive Chairman of Sorted, commented\n:\n\"M&S has a long-standing reputation for outstanding customer experience. We are pleased to have supported their ever-growing online ambitions for many years now and the previous renewal of M&S's contract with Sorted from 12-months, announced on 27 March 2024, to this renewal - running through to\u00a022 September 2028, a term of just over three years - further strengthens our partnership and represents the largest for Sorted to date.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nSorted Group Holdings Plc\nTel: +44 (0)3300 555 284\nSimon Wilkinson, Executive Chairman\nMahmoud Warriah, Chief Finance Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited\u00a0(Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nDavid Hart\nVivek Bhardwaj\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd\u00a0(Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nJames Pope\nAndy Thacker\nAbout Sorted\nSorted's Delivery Experience supports retailers in providing exceptional delivery experiences and analysing post-purchase performance.
