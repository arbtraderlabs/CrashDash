The Company's current share price of 30 pence is below the current nominal value of 62.50 pence per ordinary share (\"\nOrdinary Share\n\"). Accordingly, in order to create a lower nominal value for each Ordinary Share, the board of directors of Sorted (the \"\nBoard\n\" or the \"\nDirectors\n\") are proposing that each existing Ordinary Share will be subdivided into one new ordinary share of 0.01 pence each (the \"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") and one deferred share of 62.49 pence each (the \"\nNew Deferred Shares\n\")\u00a0(the \"\nShare Capital Reorganisation\n\").\nEach New Ordinary Share will carry the same rights as each existing Ordinary Share under the Company's articles of association (the \"\nArticles of Association\n\"). No new certificates will be issued in relation to the existing Ordinary Shares, and the existing share certificates will remain valid entitling the registered holder to the same number of New Ordinary Shares.\nEach New Deferred Share will have very limited rights and will effectively be valueless. CREST accounts of Shareholders will not be credited in respect of any entitlement to New Deferred Shares, and no share certificates will be issued in respect of New Deferred Shares.\nThe New Deferred Shares will have the rights and restrictions as set out in the Articles of Association in respect of deferred shares, which do not entitle their holders to receive notice of or attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company or to receive a dividend or other distribution and provide the Company will the authority to transfer them at effectively nil consideration per New Deferred Share to a custodian nominated by the Company. The New Deferred Shares will not be admitted to trading on AIM or any other exchange.\nFollowing the passing of all the resolutions at the AGM, the Company will implement the Share Capital Reorganisation and make an application for admission of the 7,639,705 New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM at 8:00 a.m. on 26 September 2025.\nThe number of ordinary shares in issue, and held by each Shareholder, will not change. It is simply the nominal value of the existing Ordinary Shares which will change. Accordingly, the Share Capital Reorganisation will result in the issue of 7,639,705 New Ordinary Shares and 7,639,705 New Deferred Shares.\nThe New Ordinary Shares will continue to carry the same rights as those attached to the existing Ordinary Shares, save for the change in nominal value.

The Company's current share price of 30 pence is below the current nominal value of 62.50 pence per ordinary share (\"\nOrdinary Share\n\"). Accordingly, in order to create a lower nominal value for each Ordinary Share, the board of directors of Sorted (the \"\nBoard\n\" or the \"\nDirectors\n\") are proposing that each existing Ordinary Share will be subdivided into one new ordinary share of 0.01 pence each (the \"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") and one deferred share of 62.49 pence each (the \"\nNew Deferred Shares\n\")\u00a0(the \"\nShare Capital Reorganisation\n\").\nEach New Ordinary Share will carry the same rights as each existing Ordinary Share under the Company's articles of association (the \"\nArticles of Association\n\"). No new certificates will be issued in relation to the existing Ordinary Shares, and the existing share certificates will remain valid entitling the registered holder to the same number of New Ordinary Shares.\nEach New Deferred Share will have very limited rights and will effectively be valueless. CREST accounts of Shareholders will not be credited in respect of any entitlement to New Deferred Shares, and no share certificates will be issued in respect of New Deferred Shares.\nThe New Deferred Shares will have the rights and restrictions as set out in the Articles of Association in respect of deferred shares, which do not entitle their holders to receive notice of or attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company or to receive a dividend or other distribution and provide the Company will the authority to transfer them at effectively nil consideration per New Deferred Share to a custodian nominated by the Company. The New Deferred Shares will not be admitted to trading on AIM or any other exchange.\nFollowing the passing of all the resolutions at the AGM, the Company will implement the Share Capital Reorganisation and make an application for admission of the 7,639,705 New Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM at 8:00 a.m. on 26 September 2025.\nThe number of ordinary shares in issue, and held by each Shareholder, will not change. It is simply the nominal value of the existing Ordinary Shares which will change. Accordingly, the Share Capital Reorganisation will result in the issue of 7,639,705 New Ordinary Shares and 7,639,705 New Deferred Shares.\nThe New Ordinary Shares will continue to carry the same rights as those attached to the existing Ordinary Shares, save for the change in nominal value. The New Ordinary Shares will have the same ISIN number and SEDOL code as the existing Ordinary Shares.\nFor further information please contact:\nSorted Group Holdings plc\nTel: +44 (0)3300 555 284\nSimon Wilkinson, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nDavid Hart\nVivek Bhardwaj\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nJames Pope\nAndy Thacker\nAbout Sorted\nSorted's Delivery Experience supports retailers in providing exceptional delivery experiences and analysing post-purchase performance.

Our strategic priorities during H1 FY25 have included streamlining operations, strengthening internal policies and procedures, advancing our technology roadmap, and leveraging emerging artificial intelligence (\"AI\") technologies to further enhance our platform.\nWe have made encouraging progress in solidifying our customer relationships, evidenced by the successful renewal of several key contracts. This is a testament to the continued trust our clients place in Sorted and reinforces the foundation for future growth.\nOperational and Financial Highlights\nOur focused restructuring efforts have yielded tangible results:\n\u00b7\nTeam Optimisation:\nWe maintained a streamlined team of 51, empowering a highly capable and agile senior management structure.\n\u00b7\nCost Management:\nExpenditures across back-office functions continue to be reduced, including in our Legal, HR, Finance and Administrative operations. These savings have been redeployed to strengthen our customer-facing functions, with a particular emphasis on Software Engineering and Sales functions.\n\u00b7\nPlatform Optimisation:\nWe have delivered meaningful cost efficiencies across our IT infrastructure, and further targeted improvements are expected throughout the second half of 2025.\nCustomer and Revenue Stability\nDespite internal transformation, our revenue base has remained stable.

SGL is a 100 per cent. subsidiary of Sorted Holdings Limited (\"\nSHL\n\"), which in-turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sorted.\nHighlights\n- Revenue for the Period of \u00a36.72 million (12 months ended 30 September 2022 (\"FY 22\"): \u00a35.26 million).\n- Loss before tax for the Period of \u00a311.72 million (FY 22: \u00a318.62 million).\n- Cash as at 31 December 2023 of \u00a30.32 million (FY 22: \u00a36.82 million).\n- Post Period, on 19 February 2024 Sorted completed its acquisition of SHL with the enlarged group successfully admitting to trading on AIM on the same day.\n- Creditors due within one year consists primarily of the intercompany balance between Sorted Group Limited and Sorted Holdings Limited. This is a historical balance arising through distributing external funding from Sorted Holdings Limited. This was because the external funding was obtained by Sorted Holdings Limited, but the utilisation of the funding occurred in Sorted Group Limited, as the trading entity. In the accounts of Sorted Holdings Limited, there is an equal gross asset. The liability in Sorted Group Limited and the asset in Sorted Holdings limited is eliminated in the consolidated accounts of Sorted Holdings Limited. Consequently, this liability does not exist in the consolidated accounts of Sorted Holdings Limited or Sorted Group Holdings plc. The sale of Sorted Holdings Limited to Sorted Group Holdings plc for \u00a366.67 on February 16th, 2024 does not impact this balance. Consequently, the balance remains a liability in the accounts of Sorted Group Limited and an asset in the accounts of Sorted Holdings Limited. This will remain the case until settled or formally written off, bringing the balance to zero on both sides. Sorted Holdings Limited will not seek to recover this amount. As stated above, the elimination of this intergroup balance results in no related liability (or asset) existing in the consolidated accounts of Sorted Holdings Limited and Sorted Group Holdings plc.\nFor further information please contact:\nSorted Group Holdings plc\nTel: +44 (0)3300 555 284\nSimon Wilkinson, Chairman\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nDavid Hart\nVivek Bhardwaj\nTurner Pope Investments (TPI) Ltd (Broker)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3657 0050\nJames Pope\nAndy Thacker\nAbout Sorted\nSorted's Delivery Experience supports retailers in providing exceptional delivery experiences and analysing post-purchase performance.

On 28 June 2023, we announced a secured convertible bridge loan agreement (the \"Convertible Loan Agreement\") with Sorted Holdings Limited (\"SHL\") to lend it up to \u00a32.6 million (the \"Loan\") for working capital purposes. The Convertible Loan Agreement had a redemption premium of 50% and was secured by a first fixed and floating charge over SHL's business and assets. At the Company's option, the Loan could be converted into shares representing approximately 100% of the fully diluted share capital of SHL.\nAdditionally, we simultaneously announced the entry into exclusive non-binding heads of terms for a potential acquisition of the entire issued share capital of SHL by the Company for a nominal consideration of \u00a31.00 (the \"Proposed Acquisition\"). The Proposed Acquisition constituted a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"). Accordingly, in accordance with rule 14 of the AIM Rules, the Company's ordinary shares were suspended from trading on AIM on 28 June 2023.\nOn 30 January 2024, we announced and published an AIM admission document in connection with the Proposed Acquisition. The AIM admission document detailed, among other things, the proposed acquisition of SHL, a proposed subscription of 2,285,712 new ordinary shares of 62.5 pence each in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at 87.50 pence per new Ordinary Share to raise approximately \u00a32.0 million, a proposed consolidation of every 625 existing ordinary shares of nominal value of 0.1 pence each into one new Ordinary Share, a proposed change of name and AIM ticker symbol to Sorted Group Holdings PLC and SORT respectively, director appointments, a notice of general meeting, and the restoration of trading of the Company's existing ordinary shares on AIM. Terms were agreed for the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of SHL for an aggregate nominal consideration of approximately \u00a366.73 to be paid in cash at completion.\nThe Proposed Acquisition was attractive for several reasons. This included the Proposed Acquisition being a significant opportunity to leverage SHL's technology and substantial capital investment made in SHL to date (exceeding \u00a370 million). In addition, SHL had an attractive software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") business model in the ecommerce sector with scalable, predictable revenue performance. SHL's diverse customer base of household retail brands and strong industry partnerships with the business being UK-based business with over 60 employees. Lastly, the global ecommerce market in which SHL operates has been forecast to grow significantly and is a highly fragmented market.\nOn 25 January 2024, we announced that the Company had entered into an unsecured term loan facility agreement with Bidco 3 Limited (the \"Lender\" or \"Bidco 3\") for a total principal amount of up to \u00a33.0 million (the \"Facility\"). Bidco 3 is a special purpose holding company focused on making strategic investments. The directors of the Company (the \"Directors\" or the \"Board\") believe that the Group has adequate financial resources and will not need to draw on this Facility to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.\nOn 16 February 2024, all resolutions were duly passed at a general meeting of the Company. The proposals set out in the AIM admission document were completed on 19 February 2024 with the enlarged group successfully admitting to trading on AIM on the same day (\"Admission\"). As part of this, Carmen Carey was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Mahmoud Warriah as Chief Financial Officer, and Petar Cvetkovic as Non-Executive Director. To reflect the Company's new name, the website changed to www.sorted.com on Admission.\nOn 30 April 2024, the Company announced that it had received approximately \u00a32.0 million in research and development (\"R&D\") tax credits from His Majesty's Revenue & Customs (\"HMRC\") (together the \"R&D Tax Credit\"). The R&D Tax Credit relates to SHL's claim made to HMRC in respect of the financial year ended 30th September 2022. The R&D Tax Credit has been directly applied towards reducing the Group's pay as you earn (\"PA",

On 28 June 2023, we announced a secured convertible bridge loan agreement (the \"Convertible Loan Agreement\") with Sorted Holdings Limited (\"SHL\") to lend it up to \u00a32.6 million (the \"Loan\") for working capital purposes. The Convertible Loan Agreement had a redemption premium of 50% and was secured by a first fixed and floating charge over SHL's business and assets. At the Company's option, the Loan could be converted into shares representing nearly 100% of the fully diluted share capital of SHL.\nAdditionally, we simultaneously announced entering into an exclusive non-binding heads of terms for a potential acquisition of the entire issued share capital of SHL by the Company for a nominal consideration of \u00a31.00 (the \"Proposed Acquisition\"). As part of the Proposed Acquisition, the Company would assume approximately \u00a34.0 million of SHL's outstanding debt. Existing subscribers, including shareholders of SHL, would be given the opportunity to participate in a cash subscription for up to \u00a35 million of new shares in Location Sciences Group PLC (now named as Sorted Group Holdings PLC) to align their interests with existing shareholders. The Proposed Acquisition constituted a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"). Accordingly, in accordance with rule 14 of the AIM Rules, the Company's ordinary shares were suspended from trading on AIM on 28 June 2023.\nPost the period end, on 30 January 2024 we announced and published an AIM admission document in connection with the Proposed Acquisition. The AIM admission document detailed,\ninter alia\n, the proposed acquisition of SHL, a proposed subscription of 2,285,712 new ordinary shares at 87.50 pence per new ordinary share to raise approximately \u00a32.0 million, a proposed 625 to 1 share consolidation, a proposed change of name and AIM ticker symbol to Sorted Group Holdings PLC and SORT respectively, director appointments, a notice of general meeting, and the restoration of trading of the Company's existing ordinary shares on AIM. Terms were agreed for the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of SHL for an aggregate nominal consideration of approximately \u00a366.73 to be paid in cash at completion.\nThe Proposed Acquisition was outlined as attractive for a number of reasons.

In addition, Sorted has re-seller agreements in place with major Carriers in the United Kingdom as well as in the United States.\no\nGlobal ecommerce market forecasted to reach a market size of US$6.35 trillion by 2027 according to Deloitte\n: The demand for ecommerce has been in?uenced by a number of factors including but not limited to: (i) the rise of smartphones and internet accessibility; (ii) increasing use of social media; (iii) supply chain and logistical infrastructure improvements; and (iv) changing patterns in consumer behaviour.\no\nHighly fragmented market:\nThe Directors believe that there is no dominant player that offers a delivery experience platform for the entire ecommerce spectrum with one single integrated solution. In this regard, the Directors believe that Sorted's Delivery Experience Platform offers ecommerce businesses a complete end-to-end post-purchase solution, and accordingly, there is an opportunity for Sorted to establish market leadership.\nCarmen Carey, CEO of Sorted, commented:\n\"\nThe admission to AIM is a significant milestone for Sorted and provides a great platform for our operations to grow. We look forward to keeping our shareholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders updated on developments within the Sorted business in the coming months and years\n.\"\nThe same definitions apply throughout this announcement as those set out in the Admission Document published on 30 January 2024, a copy of which is available to view at www.sorted.com, unless the context requires otherwise.\nFor further information please contact:\nSorted Group Holdings Plc\nvia Allenby Capital\nSimon Wilkinson, Chairman\nCarmen Carey, Chief Executive Officer\nMahmoud Warriah, Chief Financial Officer\nAllenby Capital Limited (Nominated Adviser)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\nDavid Hart\nVivek Bhardwaj\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

          "content": "With Sorted's new version 2.0 a potential client or existing can simulate what cost savings they can achieve before actually signing up While other platforms have experimented with usage-based pricing, our implementation stands apart through three key differentiators: 1. Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

          "content": "With Sorted's new version 2.0 a potential client or existing can simulate what cost savings they can achieve before actually signing up While other platforms have experimented with usage-based pricing, our implementation stands apart through three key differentiators: 1. Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

          "content": "With Sorted's new version 2.0 a potential client or existing can simulate what cost savings they can achieve before actually signing up While other platforms have experimented with usage-based pricing, our implementation stands apart through three key differentiators: 1. Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

          "content": "With Sorted's new version 2.0 a potential client or existing can simulate what cost savings they can achieve before actually signing up While other platforms have experimented with usage-based pricing, our implementation stands apart through three key differentiators: 1. Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",

Platform-wide integration: ATUs aren\u2019t bolted onto existing infrastructure; they\u2019re fundamental to how Sorted\u2019s platform operates. Every feature, from the core API to advanced analytics, is designed with ATU efficiency in mind. This means using our platform naturally guides you toward efficient practices 2. Predictable scaling: Our solution provides detailed ATU calculators and forecasting tools that eliminate billing surprises. Before implementing any new integration or process, you can model its exact ATU impact. This predictability is crucial for enterprises managing thousands of daily shipments. 3. Efficiency incentives: Traditional platforms profit from inefficiency \u2013 more API calls mean more infrastructure costs passed to all customers. Sorted\u2019s model aligns incentives correctly. When customers optimise their integrations, both parties benefit through reduced computational load and lower costs.

This provides the Board with assurance on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Medium Term means 3-5 years and the contract extension from yesterday is 3 years It looks like from my research here that the old CEO left last March due to having to restructure letting people go which probably wobbled him now Sorted have fully restructure saving serious money and has convinced M&S that it can continue for at least the Medium Term and M&S must like what they do to extend the contract for 3 more years Here's a couple of post from sort over the last few days https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_logistics-roi-customerexperience-activity-7364635017274183681-woJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_many-people-whove-followed-sorteds-journey-activity-7364574579089915904-dDUN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sorted-official_deliverymanagement-pricing-innovation-activity-7363210294845652993-h-Ld?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAAEG4l0gBO7-otCES7DDpar2cXo5aD5L2eLY",
