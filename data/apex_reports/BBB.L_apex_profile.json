Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, the Group is potentially entitled to a maximum additional cash consideration on the first anniversary of the disposal on the following basis:\ni. 13.7% of the Headline Price (c.AUD$6.9m (c.\u00a33.5m));\nplus\nii. a cash amount equal to Skymesh's net profit after tax, before depreciation and amortisation and unrealised foreign exchange movements, but including management fees and exceptional items, for the month of November 2024;\nplus\niii. an amount equal to the excess of the Completion Payment above the Completion Payment Cap if applicable;\nless\niv. the balance of the Skymesh customer debt not collected during the period of six months from 1 February 2025 which is greater than 120 days overdue relating to the implementation of the Pathfinder system which resulted in approximately $2.8m (the \"Pathfinder Implementation Debt\") not being invoiced or slow to be invoiced and the subsequent delayed collection of such due payments from customers;\nless\nv. the costs incurred by SKM in undertaking a recovery program of the Pathfinder Implementation Debt under the direction of the Company.\nThe Company is currently in discussions with SKM having regard to the performance of SKyMesh post its disposal by the Company. These discussions are ongoing but the outcome of the negotiations with SKM could impact not only whether or not the company is entitled to any deferred consideration but could also impose a financial obligation on the Company to SKM. The Board will keep Shareholders update on developments.\nSeparately, the Company is also announcing today its intention to seek shareholder approval to cancel the admission of its shares to trading on AIM.\nFor further information:\nBigblu Broadband Group PLC\nwww.bbb-plc.com\nFrank Waters (CEO)\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nomad and Broker)\nMarc Milmo / Finn Gordon (Corporate Finance)\nTim Redfern / Harriet Ward (ECM)\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nAbout Bigblu Broadband plc\nBigblu Broadband plc (AIM: BBB.L) is focused on supporting its retained shareholdings in Skymesh and Quickline to realise value for BBB shareholders as well as driving its Starlink performance.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In addition, the Group continues to service business customers through its distribution of Starlink Enterprise business across UK and Europe.\nFinancial Highlights - Continuing Operations\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue \u00a30.3m (1H24: \u00a30.2m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1\nloss reduced in the period to \u00a30.2m (1H24: Loss \u00a30.6m), post cost rationalisations\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Free cash outflow\n2\nreduced to \u00a30.7m (1H24: outflow \u00a35.7m), before exceptional items.\n\u00b7\nNet cash\n3\nas at 1H25 was \u00a30.4m (1H24: Net debt3 \u00a34.9m), post the receipt of the initial consideration on the disposal of Skymesh, the full repayment of the Group's historic RCF with Santander and the return of \u00a36.1m to shareholders through the tender offer.\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nBrdy New Zealand - wholly owned\no\nAs part of the disposal of Skymesh, Brdy New Zealand was separated and transferred into BBB plc's special purpose vehicle, Bigblu Broadband New Zealand Ltd, for a nominal value.\no\nThe Group continues to service 100+ customers through its satellite broadband network and at the same time actively consider opportunities to realise value for shareholders.\n\u00b7\nStarlink Enterprise Business\no\nDuring FY24, following the agreement entered with Starlink, the Group launched its Starlink distribution business. During FY24 and 1H25, the Group invested an initial \u00a32.1m in inventory as well as investing \u00a30.4m in systems and \u00a30.2m in operational resources to support the rollout in Australia and UK/Europe.\no\nIn 1H25, BBB sold 0.4k units in mainland UK/Europe, generating revenue of \u00a30.2m (1H24: 0.2k units and \u00a30.1m revenue).\n\u00b7\nAustralia - Minority Interest\no\nOn 23 December 2024 the Group disposed of its controlling interest in Skymesh to SKM for a maximum consideration of up to AUD$50.2m (\u00a325.0m) with the Group receiving an upfront cash payment of AUD$30.0m (\u00a314.9m) on completion, up to $6.9m deferred consideration payable after 12 months, and AUD$13.3m through the issue of new shares in SKM.

BBB currently retains a 2.8% stake.\no\nPost securing a \u00a3250m debt facility with The National Wealth Fund and NatWest in August 2024, Quickline has been focused on delivering their four contracts worth c\u00a3300m it had secured under the government's \u00a35bn Project Gigabit programme. These contracts subsidise the rollout of a full fibre network to more than 170,000 hard-to-reach rural homes and businesses across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire which have been left behind by commercial rollouts.\n\u00b7\nBrdy Norway - Trigger Event & Contingent Consideration Implications\no\nIn May 2024, the Group divested its holding in Brdy Norway via an MBO led by Andrew Walwyn and the local management team to Brdy Holding AS, a subsidiary of Blukom SGPS (owned and controlled by Andrew Walwyn).

Through this investment the Group was able to offer Starlink LEO internet solutions to business and small office / home office workers in Australia as well as UK / Europe. In the year, this generated \u00a30.4m of revenue for the Group.\nSkymesh - Australia\nThe focus for Australia in 2024 was the ongoing investment in Skymesh's fully integrated Cloud Based Microsoft System \"Pathfinder\" and the migration of legacy bases onto the same single system. Whilst this resulted in a number of teething issues, thereby impacting churn and the performance of Skymesh during the year, by the end of the financial year Skymesh saw stability across its customer base following investment in internal resources. SkyMesh remained the leading Australian satellite broadband service provider with c50% of all new additions, having been named Best Satellite NBN Provider for the sixth year in succession (2019-2024). In FY24, Skymesh generated revenues of \u00a322.2m and adjusted EBITDA of \u00a33.1m.\nOn 23 December 2024, the Group successfully completed its disposal of Skymesh for a total consideration of up to AUD$50.2m (c\u00a325.0m) of which AUD$43.3m was received on completion (AUD$30m paid in cash and AUD $13.3m through the issue of new shares in SKM Telecommunication's ( SKM) , the acquirer of Skymesh) and additional consideration of up to $6.9m on certain criteria. BBB retain a 33.9% stake in SKM post the transaction and 29.1% on a fully diluted basis (assuming expected Strategic Investor Options and Employee Options are exercised).\nThe Board believed that the disposal provided the Group with the opportunity to realise a strong valuation on this asset, generating an initial meaningful cash consideration for Shareholders whilst also retaining a shareholding in the business and therefore continued exposure to any potential upside from SkyMesh under SKM's ownership. We are pleased that Frank Waters CEO has joined the SKM Board and we look forward to working with the existing and new Australian leadership team who bring enormous industry experience to the business.\nQuickline Investment\nAt the year-end we retained a 2.8% holding in Quickline post the injection of \u00a3150m of additional funding by Northleaf Capital Partners since the date of acquisition in June 2021.\nDuring FY24, Quickline secured all four contracts it had tendered under the government's \u00a35bn Project Gigabit programme. These contracts subsidise the rollout of a full fibre network to more than 170k hard-to-reach rural homes and businesses across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire which have been left behind by commercial rollouts. The contracts were secured by Quickline following competitive public procurement processes and total c\u00a3300m of government subsidy.\nOn 1 August 2024 Quickline secured a \u00a3250 million debt package comprising a \u00a3125m term loan and \u00a3100m debt guarantee from the UK Infrastructure Bank alongside a \u00a325m term loan provided by ",

We were delighted with the significant contract wins of \u00a3300m by Quickline under the government's \u00a35bn Project Gigabit programme and in August 2024 Quickline secured a \u00a3250m debt package to support Quickline's large-scale broadband expansion in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire as it targets passing more than 500k rural premises in these two counties. The Company retains a 2.8% shareholding in Quickline.\nPost period end, we announced the successful disposal of SkyMesh, the Group's Australian subsidiary to a newly formed Bidco, SKM Telecommunication Services Pty Ltd (SKM), repaid all debt and returned \u00a36.1m to shareholders via a tender offer. The Company retains a 33.9% shareholding in SKM (undiluted).\nFinancial Highlights - Total Operations (Including Australia)\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue for the Group was \u00a322.9m (FY23: \u00a326.0m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Group was \u00a32.1m (FY23: \u00a34.4m)\nFinancial Highlights - Continuing operations\nPost the disposal of Norway and the majority interest in Skymesh Australia, the continuing trading operations of the Company are in New Zealand where it trades under the Brdy brand focused on the provision of internet services to remote parts of New Zealand, and the ongoing distribution of Starlink. In addition, the Group retains a 2.8% stake in Quickline and a 33.9% (undiluted) stake in SKM, neither of which are consolidated.\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue \u00a30.7m (FY23: \u00a30.7m) with a like-for-like revenue increase of c.4.2%.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2\nloss in the period for the continuing business was \u00a31.0m (FY23: Loss \u00a30.5m)\n.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted PAT\n3\nloss increased to \u00a32.0m (FY23: Loss \u00a30.7m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EPS\n4\nloss of 3.4p (FY23: loss 1.2p) with Reported EPS loss of 8.4p (FY23: Loss 8.0p)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Operating cash outflow\n5\nof \u00a32.9m (FY23: outflow \u00a30.8m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Free cash outflow\n6\nof \u00a33.4m (FY23: outflow \u00a31.0m), before exceptional items.\n\u00b7\nConsequently, net debt\n7\nas at 30 November 2024 was \u00a36.5m (FY23: Net cash \u00a31.5m)\n\u00b7\nPro forma\n8\nnet cash post disposal was \u00a37.1m, prior to the Tender Offer.\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nGroup operations including Australia\no\nGroup revenue including recurring airtime, equipment, installation sales, and one off IP sales was \u00a322.9m. (FY23: \u00a326.0m / LFL \u00a324.0m) of which the negative impact of currency movements, was \u00a30.7m. Recurring airtime revenue (revenue generated from the Company's broadband airtime) which is typically linked to contracts, was \u00a320.8m representing 90% of total revenue (FY23: 93%).\no\nGross profit margins were 29.4% in FY24 (FY23: 37.2% / LFL 34.0%).\no\nUnderlying overheads reduced to \u00a34.7m (FY23: \u00a35.2m) representing 20.2% of revenue (FY23: 20.1% / LFL 21.6%) mainly due to lower headcount costs from the re-organisation (\u00a30.4m).\no\nConsequently, the adjusted EBITDA for the period was \u00a32.1m (FY23: \u00a34.4m / LFL \u00a32.4m).\n\u00b7\nAustralian Operations\no\nFrom December 2023 the Group began to offer Starlink LEO internet solutions to business and small office / home office workers in Australia (as well as UK / Europe). This addition to the Group's product offering in Australia further strengthened the Group's position in the Australian market. We continued to work with our network partners, including NBN Co, during the period to ensure that we had a full suite of product offerings to meet all customer needs to underpin further potential increases in customer numbers, customer satisfaction and improved retention.

The Company's continuing operations comprise Skymesh in Australia, as well as the retained residual stake in Quickline Communications (\"Quickline\") in the UK.\nDuring the period there was continued progress against the Group's stated realisation strategy with the disposal of the Norwegian operations. Importantly we were delighted with the significant contract wins in Quickline where the Company retains a 2.8% shareholding. Following the disposal of our Norwegian operations and with the sole focus on our trading operations in Australia, we have undertaken a further rationalisation of the central cost base.\nFinancial Highlights - Continuing Operations (being the Australian business)\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue \u00a311.2m (1H23: \u00a313.0m) with a like for like\n1\nrevenue reduction of c.8% as we continued to focus on the migration of customers onto more appropriate packages with a higher lifetime value.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2\nin the Period of \u00a31.1m (1H23: \u00a31.5m) with\nlike for like\n1\nadjusted EBITDA in 1H23 of \u00a31.1m, on a constant currency basis following planned customer migrations and consequent realignment of cost base.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Free cash outflow\n3\nof \u00a34.5m (1H23: inflow \u00a30.1m), before exceptional items. This reflects planned stock investment of \u00a32.1m in the recently announced Starlink contract as well as anticipated one off working capital requirements associated with the transition to the new systems platform. Consequently, net debt as at 1H24 was \u00a34.9m (1H23: Net debt \u00a30.3m)\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nAustralia -\no\nAs highlighted at the year end, the emergence of 5G and LEO satellite technologies is expected to lead to an accelerated uptake of non-fibre broadband internet services in Australia.\no\nStarlink has demonstrated the appetite of consumers for alternative broadband solutions and has successfully progressed in our market. Following the Starlink investment, the Group made in December 2023 in conjunction the distribution contracts, the Group is now able to offer Starlink LEO internet solutions to business and small office / home office workers in Australia as well as UK / Europe which has further strengthened our position in the Australian market. We continue to work with our network partners including NBN Co. to ensure that we have a full suite of product offerings to meet all customer needs. New NBN Co. products recently launched at SkyMesh offer faster speeds and greater data packages than previously offered by the Group, which is expected to lead to further potential increases in customer numbers, satisfaction and improving retention.\no\nPost implementation of our new fully integrated Cloud Based Microsoft System \"Pathfinder\" and the migration of legacy bases onto the same single system, Skymesh customers who may have had multiple accounts\nwith distinctly different billable services (i.e Satellite, Fixed Wireless, VOIP, or email) have been merged into one billable SIO (Service in Operation). This exercise resulted in Skymesh having a total of 52.3k (1H23: 51.4k) unique customers as at 1H24. On a like for like basis, Skymesh increased the customer base by 0.7k customers in 1H24 (1H23: Net churn 1.6k customers) to 52.3k.\no\nSkyMesh remains the leading Australian satellite broadband service provider with c50% of all new additions, having been named Best Satellite NBN Provider for the sixth year in succession (2019-2024)\n\u00b7\nQuickline -\nContinues to be well supported by Northleaf, who acquired majority control in June 2021. Northleaf has provided \u00a3130m of additional funding since acquisition with BBB currently retaining a 2.8% stake. In addition, Quickline has secured a \u00a3250m debt facility. Quickline can currently address over 200,000 rural premises with its hybrid FTTP and FWA infrastructure and has over 10,000 customers.\nQuickline has recently secured all four contracts it had tendered under the government's \u00a35bn Project Gigabit programme. The contracts will subsidise the rollout of a full fibre network to more than 170k hard-to-reach rural homes and businesses across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire which have been left behind by commercial rollouts. The contracts have been secured by Quickline following competitive public procurement processes and total c\u00a3300m",

          "full_content": "20 May 2024 07:05\nRNS Number : 9996O\nBigblu Broadband PLC\n20 May 2024\nBigblu Broadband plc\n('BBB', the 'Company' or the 'Group')\nDisposal of Norwegian Operations\nAnd\nRelated Party Transactions\nBigblu Broadband plc (AIM: BBB.L), a leading provider of alternative super-fast and ultra-fast broadband services, announces the disposal of the Norwegian Operations comprising Brdy AS and Brdy Nordics AS (the \"Brdy Group\") to\nBrdy Holding AS (under construction)\n, a company owned by the Norwegian Management Team and Andrew Walwyn (the \"Buyer\") who has today also announced that he has stepped down from his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the \"Disposal\"). Frank Waters, currently Chief Financial Officer, will take over as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nHeadquartered in Oslo, Norway and established over 15 years ago, Brdy Group provides a range of Broadband services to both consumers and businesses across the Nordic region. The Enterprise Value of the business units being sold is \u00a31.3m and the company will write off intercompany balances as a consequence of the Buyer assuming certain existing net working capital creditors and contingent liabilities within the Brdy Group amounting to approximately \u00a31.3 million. As a result, the Equity value of the business units being disposed is \u00a31, being the Initial Consideration. In addition, BBB will be entitled to a Contingent Consideration as follows: If the Brdy Group,\n\u00b7\nin the period between 17th May 2024 and 16th May 2025, achieves an Adjusted EBITDA of five hundred thousand pounds (\u00a3500,000) or more, BBB will receive twenty (20) percent of the Adjusted EBITDA for that period, within six months of the period.\n\u00b7\nin the period between 17th May 2025 and 16th May 2026, achieves an Adjusted EBITDA of one million pounds (\u00a31,000,000) or more, BBB will receive twenty (20) percent of the Adjusted EBITDA for that period, within six months of the period.\nA Deferred Consideration is also payable of up to NOK 2.3m (c\u00a30.2m) on the return, or release of the deposit held with networks, or a Trigger Event.\nIn addition,\non\nthe occurrence of a Trigger Event, including a listing, an additional Consideration shall be payable of 20% of the proceeds less costs.\nThe disposal is in line with BBB's strategy of divesting of its assets and reducing risk attached to the potential future cash flows of the Group. The Norwegian operations have for several years encountered significant headwinds with higher than anticipated customer churn as the Company sought to tackle low broadband speeds in the region as well as faster offerings from fibre competitors. The Company has sought to address these challenges by taking steps to enhance its service proposition but also by reducing the cost base in the region. Most recently in the past financial year\n, the Company pro-actively undertook a reorganisation of the Norwegian business into two legal entities, recognising the different attributes of each, being the satellite and 5G technology business with typically lower capex, and the infrastructure business with typically higher capex. This resulted in reducing the workforce by approximately 30%, with an annualised cost saving of c.\u00a30.4m. However, customers have continued to decline with customers numbers falling from c.9.6k as at 31 May 2022 to c.6k as at 30 April 2024.\nFor the financial year ended 30 November 2023 the Brdy Group delivered revenue of NOK 52.8m (c.\u00a34.1m) and generated an audited loss before tax of NOK 42.6m (c.\u00a33.3m). Net Liabilities excluding goodwill were NOK 1.4m (c.\u00a30.1m). Since the period end, trading in the region has remained challenging and the Company is expected to incur further potentially significant demounting costs as it continues to transition to an asset light business.\nThe Board recognised the challenges it has faced in trying to turnaround the Norwegian business as well as the potential need for further cash investment in the region. The Board has undertaken a full market exercise by independent advisors over the last year to try and find acquirers for the Brdy Group as it believed that either we were able to sell the Norwegian assets, or we would have to consider closing it down with significant potential cost implications. Following this exercise, the Board believes that the proposed management buyout of the business by local management, supported by Andrew Walwyn, provided the greatest certainty of being able to dispose of its Norwegian assets and remove potential ongoing liabilities associated with these operations. The Board believes that the Disposal is in the best interests of shareholders. Following the Disposal, the Board believes that it will be able to reduce annual central costs further by c.\u00a30.4m including executive costs and that it will be able to focus exclusively on its efforts to realise value from the Australian Operations and the retained stake in Quickline.\nBigblu Operations Limited Contracts\nAs part of the reductions in the headcount wit",

Furthermore, the Company was encouraged to see the important recent contract wins in Quickline where the Company retains a 2.8% shareholding.\nThe Board remains focused on\nexecuting its value realisation strategy and\nensuring it can maximise the inherent value within its remaining Australian asset as well as the retained investment in Quickline and deliver shareholder returns.\nFinancial Highlights - Continuing Operations (being mainly the Australian operations given the disposal of the Norwegian Operations)\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue \u00a325.9m (FY22: \u00a327.2m) with like for like revenue growth\n1\non a constant currency basis of c.0.3%\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2\nin the Period of \u00a34.5m (FY22: \u00a34.1m) following further cost initiatives\n\u00b7\nAdjusted PAT3 improved to \u00a34.2m (FY22: \u00a33.2m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EPS4 profit of 7.1p (FY22: profit 5.4p) with Reported EPS loss of 8.0p (FY22: Loss 5.0p)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Operating cash inflow5 of \u00a35.3m (FY22: Inflow \u00a30.7m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Free cash inflow\n3\nbefore exceptional items of \u00a34.7m (FY22: outflow \u00a30.3m)\n\u00b7\nNet cash as at 30 November 2023 was \u00a31.5m which is after the Clear and Harbour acquisition payments of \u00a32.8m and reorganisation costs of \u00a30.8m incurred during the year\nFinancial Highlights - Group Operations including the Norwegian operations\n\u00b7\nGroup revenue in the year of \u00a330.1m (FY22: \u00a331.2m)\n\u00b7\nGroup adjusted EBITDA, before items identified as exceptional in nature, grew by 15% for the period to \u00a35.9m (FY22: \u00a35.1m)\n\u00b7\nReported loss for the year \u00a34.7m after items identified as exceptional in nature and including a loss of \u00a33.3m from the Group's Norwegian operations.\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nTotal customers for our operations in Australia at the period end were 55.3k (FY22: 51.5k) with like for like overall customer numbers largely maintained.\n\u00b7\nIn February 2023, SkyMesh completed the acquisition of the satellite operations of Harbour ISP PTY LTD, a subsidiary of Uniti Group LTD in Australia that brought with it 5.2k customers. This customer base was fully migrated onto SkyMesh systems in May 2023.\n\u00b7\nAs highlighted at the half year, the emergence of 5G and LEO satellite technologies is expected to lead to accelerated uptake of non-fibre broadband internet services in Australia. Starlink has demonstrated the appetite of consumers for alternative broadband solutions and has successfully progressed in our market with continued strong promotional offers which have impacted churn rates throughout the year in Australia, increasing from 30% to 32%. We are working with our network partners and c.15% of the customer base had been transferred to new product offerings with NBN Co by the year end.\n\u00b7\nNew product opportunities recently launched at SkyMesh will offer faster speeds and greater capacity, leading to a potential increase in customer numbers and satisfaction and therefore improved retention.

Whilst this large undertaking has caused some initial strain, we are beginning to see the targeted benefits of this investment in terms of servicing customers more efficiently and improved integrations with networks.\n\u00b7\nSkyMesh won WhistleOut best Satellite NBN provider award for the fifth year in a row.\n\u00b7\nQuickline continues to be well supported by Northleaf, who acquired majority control in June 2021.

The Company has operations in Australia, Norway and a residual stake in Quickline Communications (\"Quickline\").\nThere was progress across the Company's business units in the period, with the focus on the introduction of new products and systems improvements. The Company is therefore well positioned for the second half of the year.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue was \u00a315.0m (1H22: \u00a314.9m)\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA1 increased 2.1% to \u00a32.1m (1H22: \u00a32.0m)\n\u00b7\nLike for like revenue2 and adjusted EBITDA growth, on a constant currency basis increased by 3.1% and 21.4% respectively\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Free cash inflow3 of \u00a30.2m (1H22: inflow \u00a30.4m)\n\u00b7\nNet debt4 as at 31 May 2023 was \u00a30.3m (1H22: Net Cash \u00a34.5m) following the Acquisition in Australia, as well as one off restructuring payments made in Norway and Central.\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nSkyMesh completed the acquisition of the satellite operations of Harbour ISP PTY LTD, a subsidiary of Uniti Group LTD in Australia (the \"Acquisition\") at a cost of c.\u00a32.7m which included net 5.2k customers\n\u00b7\nTotal customers at period end were 62.6k (1H22: 60.4k), including the Acquisition\n\u00b7\nThe Company has pro-actively undertaken a reorganisation of the Norwegian business and restructured the central costs within the business. This has resulted in a reduction in the Norwegian workforce of approximately 30%, and a reduction of c.75% of our UK head office. Together bringing annual savings of \u00a30.9m\n\u00b7\nIn Norway we completed the planned separation of the business into two legal entities, recognising the different attributes of each being our satellite and 5G technology business, typically lower capex, and our infrastructure business, typically higher capex.\n\u00b7\nQuickline continues to be well supported by Northleaf with an addressable base of over 350,000 premises at the half year, with its hybrid Fixed Wireless (FWA) and Full Fibre infrastructure. The Company retains a 3.1% stake holding following further investment since the year end with a current carrying value of \u00a35.9m. Northleaf have invested \u00a3110m in total since they acquired the majority stake.\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is stated before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, share based payments and exceptional items. It also excludes property lease costs which, under IFRS 16, are replaced by depreciation and interest charges.\n2 Like for like (LFL) revenue and EBITDA is adjusted for new or divested businesses in both the current and prior year and adjusts for constant currency.\n3 Adjusted Operating cash flow relates to the amount of cash generated from the Group's operating activities and is calculated as follows: Profit/(Loss) before Tax adjusted for Depreciation, Amortisation, Share Based Payments and adjusting for changes in Working Capital and non-cash items and excludes items identified as exceptional in nature. Adjusted Free cash flow being cash (used)/generated by the Group after investment in capital expenditure, servicing of debt and payment of taxes and excludes items identified as exceptional in nature.\n4 Cash / Net debt excludes lease-related liabilities of \u00a30.9m of under IFRS 16 (FY22 \u00a31.4m).\nAndrew Walwyn, Chief Executive Officer of Bigblu Broadband plc, commented:\n\"The overall performance of the Group is in line with the Board's expectations. We are carefully extending our product offerings with our partners in each region, thereby increasing our addressable markets, at the same time implementing new systems in each territory and cutting central headcount / other costs.\nWe have reorganised our Norwegian business and our Australian business has completed another important bolt on acquisition. We continue to develop products and solutions with our network partners that will enable customers to operate as effectively as possible, particularly at a time where large numbers of customers are likely to be working from home, whether full or part time.\nSpecifically, following the recent acquisitions by SkyMesh in Australia, the Board believes that its strategy of organic growth complemented by further bolt-on acquisitions should accelerate the Company's presence across Australia with the potential to achieve 80,000 customers over the next three years. Furthermore, the Board continues to assess all options to realise ",

The Company has operations in Australia, the Nordics and a residual shareholding in Quickline Communications (\"Quickline\").\nThere was progress across all the Company's geographies and business units in the period in terms of expanding the product offerings, implementing new core platform systems and a sizeable reduction in costs, recognising market challenges globally. The Company is therefore well positioned for the second half of the year.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nTotal revenue was \u00a314.9m (1H22: \u00a314.9m).\n\u00b7\nLike for like revenue growth1 on a constant currency basis was 3.1% (1H22: growth 15.1%).\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA2 increased 3.2% to \u00a32.1m (1H22: \u00a32.0m).\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Free cash inflow3\u00a0of \u00a30.1m (1H22: inflow \u00a30.4m)\n\u00b7\nNet debt\n4\nas at 31 May 2023 was \u00a30.3m (1H22: Net Cash \u00a34.5m) after payments for the acquisition of the satellite operations of Harbour (\u00a32.7m) in February 2023, the deferred and earn out consideration payments on the acquisition of Clear (\u00a30.4m), together with planned redundancy payments in Norway and Central.\nOperational Highlights\n\u00b7\nIn February 2023, the Company's fully owned Australian business, SkyMesh PTY LTD completed the acquisition of the satellite operations of Harbour ISP PTY LTD, a subsidiary of Uniti Group LTD in Australia (the \"Acquisition\") that brought with it c.5.7k customers, before base adjustment. This base has been fully migrated onto Skymesh systems and first billings commenced in May 2023, thereby completing the transfer.\n\u00b7\nTotal customers at period end were 62.6k (1H22: 60.4k) including the Acquisition. During the period there was net churn in customers of 1.2k due to further demounting in the Nordics and base management on transfer of the Clear and Unity acquisitions.\n\u00b7\nThe emergence of 5G and LEO satellite technologies is expected to lead to accelerated uptake of non-fibre broadband internet services in Australia. Starlink has continued to progress in our market with strong promotional offers which continue to impact on current churn rates, and we are monitoring such promotion and marketing activity. We believe we can counter such threats to the business by expanding the product offerings as well as an addressable market. In this regard and working with our network partners c25% of the base has been transferred to new product offerings with NBN Co, and although early, we are seeing far higher customer satisfaction and reduced churn. Further acquisitions and new product opportunities are also emerging as SkyMesh heads into 2H23 with its product offerings likely to offer faster speeds / capacity, leading to increases in customer numbers and customer satisfaction.\n\u00b7\nIn the period and recognising global challenges, the Company has pro-actively undertaken a reorganisation of our Norwegian business and reduced the central costs within the business. This has resulted in redundancies in our Norway business, reducing the workforce by approximately 30%, with an annualised cost saving of c.\u00a30.4m, and further savings from our UK head office, resulting in approximately 75% of the central team being made redundant, with annualised savings of c\u00a30.5m.\n\u00b7\nIn Norway we completed the planned separation of the business into two legal entities, recognising the different attributes of each being our satellite and 5G technology business, typically lower capex, and our infrastructure business, typically higher capex. Following the launch of new FWA 5G products and the new satellite offerings, we are showing early signs of stabilising, although the business remains cash consumptive.\n\u00b7\nQuickline continues to be well supported by Northleaf, who acquired the majority of Quickline in June 2021, and at the half year can address over 350,000 premises with its hybrid FWA and fibre infrastructure. The Company retains a 4% stake holding after Northleaf investment of \u00a370m.\n1 Like for like (LFL) revenue treats acquired businesses as if they were owned for the same period across both the current and prior year and adjusts for constant currency and business disposed of in the period are excluded from the calculation.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA is stated before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, share based payments and exceptional\u00a0items. It also excludes property lease costs which, under IFRS 16, are replaced by depreciation and interest charges.\n3 Adjusted Operating cash flow relates to the amount of cash generated from the Group's operating activities and is calculated as follows: Profit/(Loss) before Tax adjusted for Depreciation, Amortisation, Share Based Payments and adjusting for changes in Working Ca",

Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them.

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

The BBB CEO and BoD need to get a grip and talk to the market and shareholders, instead of treating us like mushrooms!

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them.

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

          "content": "I subscribed for the article from the author who posted this last week The news sent the share price plunging, but some perspective is needed here. Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

          "content": "Also fact Liontrust sold out rather than keeping holding and voting against suggests they also think it's a lost cause to fight the delisting. In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

So for me, it seems there is limited downside, and there could be further upside to my numbers below also if things go their way. The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

So for me, it seems there is limited downside, and there could be further upside to my numbers below also if things go their way. The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

So for me, it seems there is limited downside, and there could be further upside to my numbers below also if things go their way. The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

So for me, it seems there is limited downside, and there could be further upside to my numbers below also if things go their way. The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

So for me, it seems there is limited downside, and there could be further upside to my numbers below also if things go their way. The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

So for me, it seems there is limited downside, and there could be further upside to my numbers below also if things go their way. The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Not surprising as this must be absolutely tiny in the context of Gresham's fund so not worth the hassle for them. Where do you get your info btw - what data providers do you use? Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

          "content": "After much soul searching I doubled my stake today, so have about \u00a38k in this. I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",

The main risk is the opportunity cost of having funds locked up in this for 1 or 2 years and end up with a similar amount to what you paid for them. If Harwood top up over the coming days and go up to 29.9% I would view it as being extremely positive for the value here.

Cavendish has a similar target price from their note in August which is available on research tree. I think given todays news these are too optimistic. My hopefully conservative scenario is: - Existing business / cash: small and loss making currently so ascribe no value - Deferred SkyMesh payments: my read is they are due $6.9m AUD less uncollected debt (up to $2.8m AUD) less costs to collect the uncollected debt. You would really hope that SKM didn't spend more collecting the debt than the debt is worth. BUT from the RNS it seems SKM wants to renegotiate the deferred consideration as it seems perhaps performance at SkyMesh has gone backwards. You would hope they get $2-3m from this and would argue they have a pretty strong case given I don't think the $6.9m was conditional on anything, but they are in a tricky position as they still own 25% of SkyMesh still so probably don't want to go in too hard and destroy relationships. For my base case I'm assuming nothing from this, but it could be worse or better. - Their SkyMesh stake was supposedly worth $13.25m AUD at the sale price, but would suggest this needs to be written down if the business isn't performing. Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital. Putting all that together I get to \u00a36.5-7.5m or 14-17p, which is roughly 1.5-2.0x the current SP.",

This *massive* (in BBB terms) trade must have been an institutional investor or an as yet undisclosed director deal, but the timing and lack of effect on the SP suggests that the ordinary investor (such as me) is being played and can write off our losses right now. Personally I need to see more than a four-fold SP increase just to break even and nothing suggests that's even going to happen. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a distribution within six months of the SkyMesh deal of somewhere between 13p and 17p per share, but that will do nothing for the value of the shares as this artificially low SP appears to confirm. I guess I'm now resigned to having lost tens of thousands on this stock.",

Last week Skymesh also sold some assets to Summit, but retained the end customers with a new partnership: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/skymesh-sells-clear-networks-fixed-wireless-infrastructure-597863. That should be beneficial to margins it seems. Quickline stake is \u00a37m, so that's over 25% of the mcap. Let's see if they manage to sell part of the nordics business (or they expand to Finland and Sweden), but that has to be worth something as well. I think the company could conservatively be worth 80p, so 2x the current price. The problem is they don't communicate often, and when they do they do not sell themselves well. But sum of the parts is higher than price, they generate FCF, and Mills now owns 25% of the company",

Assuming Bigblu doesn\u2019t receive any deferred consideration from SkyMesh, the company\u2019s fully diluted stake in the business is still worth \u00a36.8mn (15.5p), or more than double its depressed market capitalisation of \u00a32.4mn, unless SkyMesh\u2019s trading has deteriorated markedly. In addition, Bigblu holds a 2.8 per cent equity stake and loan notes (valued in Bigblu\u2019s accounts at \u00a35.9mn, or 13.5p) in Quickline, a company that is building fixed wireless access networks to address the \u2018UK digital divide\u2019. Quickline\u2019s private equity owner, Northleaf Capital Partners, has provided \u00a3150mn of funding since acquiring a majority stake in the business from Bigblu in April 2021. It means that the combined value of the two equity stakes is five times Bigblu\u2019s market capitalisation. Moreover, in the worst-case scenario, whereby the company owes a financial liability to SkyMesh, it could always be settled by reducing the equity stake in the acquisition vehicle on a pro-rata basis. Harwood Capital, Liontrust, Gresham House and BGF Investments hold half of Bigblu\u2019s shares, and will want the company to realise the maximum value from its SkyMesh and Quickline investments and return the proceeds to shareholders. So, having rated the shares a hold at the interim results (\u2018These shares could double \u2013 but it might take time\u2019,\u00a0IC, 1 September 2025), I would hold on as the chronic undervaluation of the company\u2019s equity will unwind when Bigblu disposes of its two major investments,",

Have \u00a312.5k in this now, which (ludicrously!) is almost 0.5% of the company! I'm not sure if I'm foolish or brave at this point! Maybe I'll go to the EGM and try recoup some of my investment in free tea and biscuits! I take Richard Griffiths (aka 'The Welsh Wizard') doubling his stake to be VERY positive. Google him; he's a very highly regarded investor and has a reputation for being both very sharp and quite active with investments. As a 26% shareholder here he can be, and indeed if he wanted to he could probably block the delisting - although I don't think he will. I suspect these will continue to drift up as people cotton on to RG's big vote of confidence, and as I don't think there will be much more stock around out there going forward. I might trim my stake if they do really well in the coming weeks, but am realistically settling in for the long term here, which I guess is 12-24 months, with the lack of info and liquidity that private holdings will come with. The killer here really is the lack of info that they provided in their RNS. It does make me nervous that maybe SkyMesh is a write off. And Quickline is tricky to value. A degree of faith required, but am hoping the potential upside here - as per my earlier post - makes the discomfort worthwhile.",

Maybe worth half that at $7.5m AUD (\u00a33.7m) - They have \u00a34m in loan notes to Quickline from when they sold it, which should still be worth \u00a34m as senior to equity (unless quickline goes bust) - They have 2.8% equity stake in Quickline, which was worth \u00a32.5m back at point of transaction in 2021, but I think is on their balance sheet at c.\u00a32m in annual report, and this would have been audited so seems legit. Quickline seems to be doing OK, so would hope this bit is still worth \u00a32m, but to be conservative say \u00a31m. - Take another \u00a31-2m off the above for transaction costs etc to execute the disposals and returns of capital.

Are you just matching up trades that go through to shareholders ie the 500,000 and the  3,323,348 trade today matching up to Gresham's 3,823,348 stake? I'm guessing the 3,400,000 trade today is the other side of this then? If it's one buyer I don't think it can be Harwood as it would push them above 30%. Griffiths maybe? It's a chunky stake to go to one buyer if not institutional. Should be an RNS in the next few days if it has gone to one or two buyers.",

In the next few weeks we should find out: - Whether its delisting or not. Does it rerate if it stays on the market? Not sure, I'm fine with it delisting, but would like more information about how / when they plan on realising the value from their various stakes. Base case is it delists on 18th December - What outcome is / or at least more details about negotiations wrt SkyMesh deferred cons. In theory this was due to be paid on the 23rd December The timing here does make me nervous. They have possibly timed the delisting such that the deferred cons. outcome occurs after its already delisted, so perhaps less disclosure rules to follow. However I did see this from their interim results which implies strongly that there has been nothing untoward regarding the sales process / financial information provided to Salter / SKM. Also BBB's CEO sits on their Board still presumably is quite on top of the investment and shouldn't have been surprised by recent developments. All in all I think it's a strange situation, and not quite sure what to make of it. And BBB's comms on it have not been the most transparent or clearest either... \"Skymesh FY24 accounts were signed on 10 June 2025 post a review by SKM Board of Directors and were unchanged from that reported within the BBB's FY24 year end results.\"",

I think its a higher risk play as there isn't much information out there about how SkyMesh and Quickline are trading / valued, and nothing public about when / how / if BBB will realise their investments in those. But think my previous analysis stands - you pretty much need everything to go against them for there not to be value at these levels. For Quickline loan notes (\u00a34m) to be worthless implies that that company goes bust. And for their c.30% stake in SkyMesh to be worthless it also assumes that it will largely go bust (or that there is some legal case taken against BBB regarding the sale process). Not without risk, but you need all this to go against them to lose money. Simon Thompson wrote it up again in Investor Chronicle. I bought a subscription to read it (\u00a312 for 12 weeks intro offer), and it basically is the same logic as mine below - no new information. But interesting he is still bullish, he's been following it for a while. Liontrust selling out is interesting also. I wonder where their stake has gone? 8% at this SP is 'only' \u00a3200k so feasible that its mainly gone to retail. An existing institution topping up would be a big sign of confidence. Again I wonder ig Harwood are inside though and can't deal. Base case still is that it delists. I mean the General Meeting is going to be at Harwoods office - surely a sign that they are supportive, and suspect Richard Griffiths would be also as well as directors - so that is 39% give or take. As to the rest of the register - who knows? Gresham hold it in their Microcap fund - not sure if they can / will want to hold it as an unlisted stock. BGF - likewise I don't know. Andrew Walwyn would likely support so that gets them to 45%. Retail usually doesn't vote, so suspect they will get it through unless both Gresham and BGF vote against. And my suspicion is that they already have support of at least one of these otherwise they wouldn't have gone ahead with it.",
