UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THOSE PERSONS THAT RECEIVED INSIDE INFORMATION IN A MARKET SOUNDING ARE NO LONGER IN POSSESSION OF SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION, WHICH IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n16 January 2026\nGCM Resources plc\n(\"\nGCM\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nPlacing to raise approximately \u00a31.0\nmillion\nGCM Resources plc (AIM: GCM), the AIM traded resource exploration and development company,\nannounces\nthat it has conditionally raised approximately \u00a31.0\nmillion (before expenses) by way of a placing (\nthe\n\"\nPlacing\n\") of\na total of 16,666,667 new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the\nCompany (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") at a\nprice of 6.0 pence per new Ordinary Share\n(the \"\nIssue Price\n\").\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nEquity raise of approximately \u00a31.0 million at 6.0 pence per new Ordinary Share.\n\u00b7\nThe net proceeds from the Placing are intended to be used by the Company for working capital purposes.\n\u00b7\nThe Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 20 per cent. to the closing bid price of 7.50 pence per Ordinary Share on 15 January 2026.\n\u00b7\nClear Capital Markets Corporate Broking (\n\"\nClear Capital\n\"\n) is acting as sole bookrunner in connection with the Placing.\n\u00b7\nThe new Ordinary Shares are to be issued pursuant to the Company's existing authorities granted at the general meeting of the Company on\n1\n7 December 2025.\nBackground to the Placing and use of proceeds\nThe Company continues to work towards progressing its Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"\nProject\n\") in north-west Bangladesh although this continues to remain subject to,\ninter alia\n, securing the requisite approvals from the Government of Bangladesh (the \"\nGovernment\n\") in order to develop the Project. Against this backdrop, recently there has been a noticeable shift of momentum in the direction in favour of the use of own natural resources within Bangladesh. With the up and coming National Elections in February 2026 in Bangladesh, there are strong indications which began with the initiatives led by the Ministry for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources focusing on strategies and challenges related to the country's coal-based energy sector in March 2025, that an incoming Government will be seriously considering developing its domestic coal and other natural resources. While this offers no certainty in relation to the Project, this bodes well for the Company.\nGiven the above the Board considers the Placing to be in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will provide the necessary working capital to support GCM's ongoing operations. These funds will be allocated to corporate overheads, legal and advisory costs, and general administrative expenses associated with managing the Company effectively.\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will help ensure that the Company is in the financial position to advance its broader strategic objectives.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Placing comprises the issue of 16,666,667 new Ordinary Shares (the\n\"\nPlacing Shares\n\"\n) at the Issue Price to conditionally raise approximately \u00a31.0 million before expenses for the Company (approximately \u00a30.94 million after expenses but excluding VAT).\nThe Placing Shares will be issued\u00a0on a non-pre-emptive basis\u00a0utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the general meeting of the Company on 17 December 2025 (\"\n2025 AGM\n\").\nWhen issued, the Placing Shares will represent approximately 4.72 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the Company and will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares.\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated 15 January 2026 between Clear Capital and the Company (the \"\nPlacing Agreement\n\"), Clear Capital has, subject to certain conditions, procured subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Issue Price.\nThe Placing Agreement contains provisions entitling Clear Capital to terminate the Placing (and the arrangements associated with it), at any time prior to Admission in certain circumstances, including in the event of a material breach of the warranties given in the Placing Agreement, the failure of the Company to comply with its obligations under the Placing Agreement, or the occurrence of a force majeure event or a material adverse change affecting the financial position or business or prospects of the Company. If this right is exercised, the Placing will not proceed and any monies that have been received in respect of the Placing will be returned to the applicants without interest and Admission will not occur. The Company has agreed to pay Clear Capital a placing commission and all other costs and expenses of, or in connection with, the Placing.\nThe Placing is not being underwritten by Clear Capital or any other person.\nIssue of warrants\nIn addition, Clear Capital, who are acting as sole bookrunner in respect of the Placing, will be issued with 1,000,000 warrants to subscribe for\u00a0new Ordinary Share (\"Warrants\") at a price of 6 pence per Ordinary Share exercisable for a period of 3 years from Admission (as defined below).\nThe Warrants will not be admitted to trading on AIM or any other stock market. The issuance of the Warrants is subject to Admission and will be issued utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the 2025 AGM.\nAdmission to AIM\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is currently expected that Admission will occur at 8.00 a.m. on 21 January 2026 or such later time and/or date as Clear Capital and the Company may agree (being in any event no later than 8.00 a.m. on 21 January 2026).\nTotal voting rights\nOn Admission, the Company will have 352,958,790 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in issue, each with one voting right. There are no shares held in treasury. Therefore, upon Admission, the Company's total number of ordinary shares in issue and voting rights will be 352,958,790 and this figure may be used by shareholders from Admission as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nBen Tadd / Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources plc\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM\nresource exploration and development company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

The Ordinary Shares are not appropriate for a target market of investors whose objectives include no capital loss. Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Ordinary Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Ordinary Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Ordinary Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital projection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Clear Capital will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties.

(\"\nPowerChina\n\") has agreed to an extension of the memorandum of understanding (\"\nMoU\n\") for a period of a further 24 months from 6 December 2025 to 6 December 2027 on the same terms as the previous memorandum of understanding which is primarily focused on the Phulbari coal mine development.\nIt is acknowledged that working under the MOU, the parties have already taken a significant step towards developing the Phulbari coal mine. This is demonstrated by the signing of an EPC contract for \"Phulbari Coal Mining Infrastructure Construction and Overburden Stripping\", which was announced by the Company on 11 March 2024. The scope of work under this contract includes the design, procurement, installation and commissioning of mine infrastructure and overburden removal, dewatering and drainage. It also includes selective mining and stockpiling of valuable industrial mineral co-products that occur in the overburden and are expected to deliver considerable cashflow for the Project ahead of any coal extraction. Importantly, the proposed mine development is now heading in the direction of contract mining which means that the mining is carried out by an experienced mining contractor utilising their own resources and mining equipment resulting in reduced technical risk and start-up capital expenditure requirement.\nWorking under this extended MOU, GCM and PowerChina aim to determine the modality for PowerChina to become involved in other packages of work and financing that are necessary to fully develop the Phulbari coal mine. PowerChina's involvement as a Mine Development Partner remains subject to the approval of PowerChina internal compliance and all other relevant regulatory agencies.\nMichael Tang, Chief Executive of GCM, commented\n:\n\"Working under the MOU, GCM and PowerChina will have the opportunity to finalise the remaining work packages necessary to bring the Phulbari coal mine into production. It also further strengthens our working relationship and demonstrates our ability to bring the Project to fruition. Having PowerChina as our Development Partner will greatly assist with obtaining the necessary Government approval and demonstrating that the proposed Phulbari coal mine will provide a large reliable supply of affordable commercial energy that will reduce the Country's dependence on expensive imported energy products.\"\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nRichard Hutchison / Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources plc\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM listed mining and energy company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

GCM requires approval from the Government of Bangladesh in order to develop the Project. The Company has a strategy of linking the Company's mine proposal to supplying coal to the Government of Bangladesh's existing and in the pipeline coal-fired power plants and / or power plants developed development partners. Together with credible, internationally recognised strategic development partners, GCM aims to deliver a practical power solution to provide the cheapest coal-fired electricity in the country, in a manner amenable to the Government of Bangladesh.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
