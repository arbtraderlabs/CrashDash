Progress remains subject to a number of factors, including the securing of the necessary approvals from the Government of Bangladesh (the \"Government\") to enable development of the Project. Against this backdrop, there has recently been a discernible shift in policy discussion within Bangladesh towards greater utilisation of the country's own natural resources. This has been reflected in initiatives led by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, including discussions in March 2025 focusing on strategies and challenges relating to the coal-based energy sector. With national elections scheduled in Bangladesh on 12 February 2026 these developments suggest that a future government may give increased consideration to the development of domestic coal and other natural resources. While there can be no certainty that these broader policy discussions will translate into specific outcomes for the Project, the Board believes these trends are encouraging for the Company.\nIn light of the above the Board considers the Placing to be in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will provide the necessary working capital to support GCM's ongoing operations. These funds will be allocated to corporate overheads, legal and advisory costs, and general administrative expenses associated with managing the Company effectively.\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will help ensure that the Company is in the financial position to advance its broader strategic objectives.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Placing comprises the issue of 15,244,000 new Ordinary Shares (the\n\"\nPlacing Shares\n\"\n) at the Issue Price to conditionally raise approximately \u00a31.25 million before expenses for the Company (approximately \u00a31.18 million after expenses but excluding VAT).\nThe Placing Shares will be issued\u00a0on a non-pre-emptive basis\u00a0utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the general meeting of the Company on 17 December 2025 (\"\n2025 AGM\n\").\nWhen issued, the Placing Shares will represent approximately 4.14 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the Company and will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares.\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated 10 February 2026 between Clear Capital and the Company (the \"\nPlacing Agreement\n\"), Clear Capital has, subject to certain conditions, procured subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Issue Price.\nThe Placing Agreement contains provisions entitling Clear Capital to terminate the Placing (and the arrangements associated with it), at any time prior to Admission in certain circumstances, including in the event of a material breach of the warranties given in the Placing Agreement, the failure of the Company to comply with its obligations under the Placing Agreement, or the occurrence of a force majeure event or a material adverse change affecting the financial position or business or prospects of the Company. If this right is exercised, the Placing will not proceed and any monies that have been received in respect of the Placing will be returned to the applicants without interest and Admission will not occur. The Company has agreed to pay Clear Capital a placing commission and all other costs and expenses of, or in connection with, the Placing.\nThe Placing is not being underwritten by Clear Capital or any other person.\nIssue of warrants\nIn addition, Clear Capital, who are acting as sole bookrunner in respect of the Placing, will be issued with 914,640 warrants to subscribe for\u00a0new Ordinary Share (\"Warrants\") at a price of 8.2 pence per Ordinary Share exercisable for a period of 3 years from Admission (as defined below).\nThe Warrants will not be admitted to trading on AIM or any other stock market. The issuance of the Warrants is subject to Admission and will be issued utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the 2025 AGM.\nAdmission to AIM\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is currently expected that Admission will occur at 8.00 a.m. on 16 February 2026 or such later time and/or date as Clear Capital and the Company may agree (being in any event no later than 8.00 a.m. on 16 February 2026).\nTotal voting rights\nOn Admission, the Company will have 368,202,790 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in issue, each with one voting right. There are no shares held in treasury. Therefore, upon Admission, the Company's total number of ordinary shares in issue and voting rights will be 368,202,790 and this figure may be used by shareholders from Admission as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nRichard Hutchison/ Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources plc\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM\nresource exploration and development company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

The Ordinary Shares are not appropriate for a target market of investors whose objectives include no capital loss. Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Ordinary Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Ordinary Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Ordinary Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital projection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Clear Capital will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Ordinary Shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\".

The Ordinary Shares are not appropriate for a target market of investors whose objectives include no capital loss. Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Ordinary Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Ordinary Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Ordinary Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital projection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Clear Capital will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Ordinary Shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\".

(\"\nPowerChina\n\") has agreed to an extension of the memorandum of understanding (\"\nMoU\n\") for a period of a further 24 months from 6 December 2025 to 6 December 2027 on the same terms as the previous memorandum of understanding which is primarily focused on the Phulbari coal mine development.\nIt is acknowledged that working under the MOU, the parties have already taken a significant step towards developing the Phulbari coal mine. This is demonstrated by the signing of an EPC contract for \"Phulbari Coal Mining Infrastructure Construction and Overburden Stripping\", which was announced by the Company on 11 March 2024. The scope of work under this contract includes the design, procurement, installation and commissioning of mine infrastructure and overburden removal, dewatering and drainage. It also includes selective mining and stockpiling of valuable industrial mineral co-products that occur in the overburden and are expected to deliver considerable cashflow for the Project ahead of any coal extraction. Importantly, the proposed mine development is now heading in the direction of contract mining which means that the mining is carried out by an experienced mining contractor utilising their own resources and mining equipment resulting in reduced technical risk and start-up capital expenditure requirement.\nWorking under this extended MOU, GCM and PowerChina aim to determine the modality for PowerChina to become involved in other packages of work and financing that are necessary to fully develop the Phulbari coal mine. PowerChina's involvement as a Mine Development Partner remains subject to the approval of PowerChina internal compliance and all other relevant regulatory agencies.\nMichael Tang, Chief Executive of GCM, commented\n:\n\"Working under the MOU, GCM and PowerChina will have the opportunity to finalise the remaining work packages necessary to bring the Phulbari coal mine into production. It also further strengthens our working relationship and demonstrates our ability to bring the Project to fruition. Having PowerChina as our Development Partner will greatly assist with obtaining the necessary Government approval and demonstrating that the proposed Phulbari coal mine will provide a large reliable supply of affordable commercial energy that will reduce the Country's dependence on expensive imported energy products.\"\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nRichard Hutchison / Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources plc\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM listed mining and energy company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

Against this backdrop, recently there has been a noticeable shift of momentum in the direction in favour of the use of own natural resources within Bangladesh. With the up and coming National Elections in February 2026 in Bangladesh, there are strong indications which began with the initiatives led by the Ministry for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources focusing on strategies and challenges related to the country's coal-based energy sector in March 2025, that an incoming Government will be seriously considering developing its domestic coal and other natural resources. While this offers no certainty in relation to the Project, this bodes well for the Company.\nGiven the above the Board considers the Placing to be in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will provide the necessary working capital to support GCM's ongoing operations. These funds will be allocated to corporate overheads, legal and advisory costs, and general administrative expenses associated with managing the Company effectively.\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will help ensure that the Company is in the financial position to advance its broader strategic objectives.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Placing comprises the issue of 16,666,667 new Ordinary Shares (the\n\"\nPlacing Shares\n\"\n) at the Issue Price to conditionally raise approximately \u00a31.0 million before expenses for the Company (approximately \u00a30.94 million after expenses but excluding VAT).\nThe Placing Shares will be issued\u00a0on a non-pre-emptive basis\u00a0utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the general meeting of the Company on 17 December 2025 (\"\n2025 AGM\n\").\nWhen issued, the Placing Shares will represent approximately 4.72 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the Company and will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares.\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated 15 January 2026 between Clear Capital and the Company (the \"\nPlacing Agreement\n\"), Clear Capital has, subject to certain conditions, procured subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Issue Price.\nThe Placing Agreement contains provisions entitling Clear Capital to terminate the Placing (and the arrangements associated with it), at any time prior to Admission in certain circumstances, including in the event of a material breach of the warranties given in ",

The unexpected eruption of student-led protests in mid-2024 catalysed the end of th\ne fifteen-year Awami League government of Sheikh Hasina. Initially sparked by discontent over government job quotas, the protests quickly expanded into a nationwide movement demanding systemic reform and an end to long-standing political dominance. The rap\nid escalation, and the scale of public mobilisation, ultimately forced the Prime Minister to step down and leave the country in early August 2024.\nIn the aftermath, an Interim Government under the leadership of Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus was install\ned with the twin mandates of restoring stability and laying the groundwork for credible democratic elections. This administration has pursued institutional reform, re-establishment of rule of law, and re-evaluation of national economic priorities, includin\ng the future of domestic energy and resource development. The Coal Development Forum convened by the Interim Government on 27 February 2025 was a key milestone, reaching a clear consensus that Bangladesh must utilise its own coal resources to secure afford\nable and sustainable energy supply. The Forum recognised GCM's proposed Phulbari Coal and Power Project as the most advanced and immediately implementable opportunity to achieve this objective.\nThe Interim Government continued with initiatives to assist a democratically elected government move forward with domestic coal sector development with the posting of\na\nPolicy on Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector on the\nBPDB (Bangladesh Power Development Board) website\n. This introduces several key proposals aimed at increasing private investment in power generation and signals a shift away from the traditional IPP (Independent Power Producer) model, where the government o\nr BPDB is the sole buyer under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Significantly:\n\u00b7\nThe policy explicitly grants Merchant Power Plants the first right to develop a supporting coal mine, if the power plant is based on coal.\n\u00b7\nSurplus Power can be sol\nd directly to customers.\n\u00b7\nOpens the possibility for surplus coal to also be sold to other power plants, as it is implied that the intent of the government is to reduce dependency on imported coal.\n\u00b7\nEncourages foreign investors to participate without the need\nof a local partner.\nThen\non 27 August 2025, BIDA (Banglades",

The Company has been informed that the officers of Polo are currently undertaking steps to restore its status as a registered company in the BVI including the appointment of a new BVI agent. This is expected to occur following,\ninter alia\n, the satisfactory completion of customary due diligence on Polo and its stakeholders by the new BVI agent, followed by a court order as required under the laws of the BVI. Notwithstanding this, there can be no certainty that Polo will be restored as a registered company in the BVI, nor as to the timing of any such restoration.\nAs most recently announced on 31 March 2025, Polo has provided a \u00a33.5 million loan facility to the Company of which as at 31 December 2024, \u00a3300,000 remained undrawn. The board of directors of GCM believe that the Company's indebtedness to Polo which, at 31 December 2024 amounted to \u00a35,923,000 including loan interest remains unaffected given the expectation that the officers of Polo will restore Polo's status as a registered company in the BVI.\nPrior to Polo's dissolution, Polo was the parent company of Polo Investments Limited (\"\nPolo Investments\n\"). Polo Investments is the registered legal holder of 43,328,253 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company, representing 12.88 per cent of the Company's issued share capital. Notwithstanding the status of Polo, Polo Investments remains as an active separate legal entity.\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj / Ashur Joseph\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nRichard Hutchison / Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM resource exploration and development, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

Over the past year our Dhaka team has reported on efforts by the Ministry for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (\"the Ministry\") to prepare a presentation focusing on strategies and challenges related to the country's coal-based energy sector. This initiative waxed and waned as the country's political landscape changed but we are delighted to report that a government organised seminar focussed on \"Prospects and Challenges of Bangladesh's Coal Resources and Measures to Overcome\" took place on 27 February this year.\nThe Seminar was chaired by the Energy Secretary with the Energy Adviser as the chief guest. There were over 70 invited guests with some 40% being government agency officials, 50% from academia and 10% media representatives. The Energy Adviser set the scene regarding the coal debate and said that the country needs to decide on coal extraction, whether to pursue open-pit or underground mining, how to select the mining companies, and whether to review existing studies or conduct new ones. The Energy Secretary emphasised that the time has come to decide to use the country's resources. He stated the country has many coal-based power plants and is struggling to pay foreign currency for coal imports. He further stated that the seminar had been organized to create a roadmap for using national resources and that decisions will be made on how to utilize the country's coal resources following discussions with participants at the seminar.\nThe Seminar was informed that to save hard-earned foreign currency in an import-dependent energy system, urgent decisions must be made to extract the vast amount of coal reserves in the country in the national interest. Coal-based power plants with a capacity of some 8,000 megawatts have been established in the country, however due to a lack of coal, the plants in operation cannot run at full capacity. A significant amount of foreign currency is being spent on coal imports. In this situation, there is no alternative but to start extracting the 7,823 million tons of coal reserves. The southern part of the government-owned Barapukuria coal mine and the proposed Phulbari coal project have completed all necessary surveys and are ready for mining activities.\nIt is significant for GCM and its shareholders that this Seminar being led by the Energy Adviser and Energy Secretary, finally demonstrates positive intentions by the Bangladesh Government to develop its domestic coal resources. This message was reinforced by the Presentation by Government personnel that highlighted the proposed Phulbari coal mine readiness and benefits and its ability to help solve the country's coal supply needs. Together with our consultants we are examining the steps to be taken that maximise leverage from the Seminar in pursuit of approval and development of the Project.\nBack to the reporting period; it was dominated by a radical change in the Bangladesh political landscape that started mid-year with\nstudent led protests\nfocused on\npublic service job quota reforms\nto provide equality in job applications. However, the situation\nquickly escalated into a larger anti-government demonstration, that\non 5 August\nled to the\nresignation\nof the\nlong-term\nAwami League and caused the former Prime Minister to\nflee\nBangladesh.\nNobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus\nagreed to take on the role of Chief Adviser and form an Interim Government chartered with maintaining law and order and\nimplementing\nmajor\ninstitutional reforms in preparation for fair elections\n.

Against this backdrop, recently there has been a noticeable shift of momentum in the direction in favour of the Company. For example, it has become apparent that from initiatives led by the Ministry for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources focusing on strategies and challenges related to the country's coal-based energy sector, that the Government is serious regarding developing its domestic coal resources. While this offers no certainty in relation to the Project, this bodes well for the Company.\nAgainst the backdrop of the above, the Company continues to generate nil revenues and incurs ongoing pre-development (non-cash) expenditure because of the renewal of certain consultants' contracts as well as administrative expenses. In this regard, the board of directors of GCM (the \"\nBoard\n\") expects to report an unaudited loss after tax of \u00a31.3 million for the six months ended 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: loss after tax of \u00a30.7 million). Similarly, the Company expects to report unaudited administrative expenses for the six months ended 31 December 2024 of \u00a3461,000 (31 December 2023: \u00a3355,000) and capitalised project expenditure for the period of \u00a3259,000 (31 December 2023: \u00a3173,000). Lastly, as at 31 December 2024, unaudited cash and cash equivalents are expected to be \u00a30.9 million.\nGiven the above financial performance, the Board considers the Placing to be in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will provide the necessary working capital to support GCM's ongoing operations. These funds will be allocated to corporate overheads, legal and advisory costs, and general administrative expenses associated with managing the Company effectively.\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will help ensure that the Company is in the financial position to advance its broader strategic objectives.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Placing comprises the issue of 33,333,333 new Ordinary Shares (the\n\"\nPlacing Shares\n\"\n) at the Issue Price to conditionally raise approximately \u00a31.0 million before expenses for the Company (approximately \u00a30.92 million after expenses but excluding VAT).\nThe Placing Shares will be issued\u00a0on a non-pre-emptive basis\u00a0utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the general meeting of the Company on 13 December 2024.\nWhen issued, the Placing Shares will represe",

(\"\nDyani\n\")\n(\nthe\n\"Dyani\nAgreement\n\"), to maintain and develop the Company's relationship with our key partner, Power Construction Corporation of China, Ltd. (\"\nPowerChina\n\"), on similar terms as previously announced. The Dyani Agreement was most recently extended on 29 June 2020 and expired on 30 June 2022. Details of the key terms of the Dyani Agreement are set out below.\nDyani Agreement\nDyani has helped the Company to make significant progress in developing our partnership with PowerChina. The previous agreement with Dyani expired on 30 June 2022 and Dyani has continued to assist GCM. For example, Dyani has played a key role in the milestone of signing the Phulbari Coal Mining Infrastructure Construction and Overburden Stripping Contract (\"\nMine Construction Contract\n\") which was announced on 11 March 2024 as well as the extension of the memorandum of understanding (\"\nMoU\n\") announced on 13 December 2024. While the Company has a strong direct relationship with the Bangladesh office of PowerChina, Dyani maintains our connections at the Bangladesh office and the head office level in Beijing. The strength of this bilateral relationship with PowerChina is crucial for us to maintain our credibility with the Government of Bangladesh, and as the operator of such a significant asset as the Project. Consideration under the Dyani Agreement is payable in new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the share capital of the Company (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\"), which aligns Dyani's interests with Shareholders and preserves the Company's cash position while we work for consent to develop the Project.\nKey terms of the contract\nUnder the terms of the Dyani Agreement, which will expire on 31 December 2025, Dyani shall provide services to assist the Company to:\n\u00b7\nPromote the Project; grow its relationship with its key development partner, PowerChina; facilitate PowerChina's assistance in achieving project approval from the Government of Bangladesh; and securing finance necessary to take the Project to the stage of coal extraction with positive cashflow.\n\u00b7\nIdentify additional project opportunities that represent business opportunities for GCM that could be developed as adjuncts to the Project.\nDyani will receive share-based success fees on achieving milestones as well as a monthly retainer fee, as follows:\n\u00b7\nA retainer fee of \u00a325,000 per month backdated from 1 January 2024, paid quarterly in arrears by the issuance of new Ordinary Shares priced at the 10 trading days volume weighted average price (\"\nVWAP\n\") immediately prior to the end of the relevant quarter. Accordingly, the following new Ordinary Shares will be issued to Dyani in respect of fees due:\no\nFor the quarter ended 31 March 2024 and using the VWAP of 8.63p for the 10 trading days prior thereto, a resultant issue of 869,061 new Ordinary Shares;\no\nFor the quarter ended 30 June 2024 and using the VWAP of 5.4455p for the 10 trading days prior thereto, a resultant issue of 1,377,284 new Ordinary Shares;\no\nFor the quarter ended 30 September 2024 and using the VWAP of 3.0074p for the 10 trading days prior thereto, a resultant issue of 2,493,849 new Ordinary Shares; and\no\nFor the quarter ended 31 December 2024 and using the VWAP of 1.8908p for the 10 trading days prior thereto, a resultant issue of 3,966,575 new Ordinary Shares.\n\u00b7\nThe success fees comprise:\no\na one-time fee equal to 2% of Company's issued share capital (the \"\nISC\n\") as at 7 January 2025 for facilitating and delivering the Mine Construction Contract (an initial mine construction EPC Contract with PowerChina), covering mine infrastructure and initial overburden removal (noting that this is a sub-set of an all-encompassing Mine Development and Operations Contract). This was achieved on 9 March 2024 and accordingly Dyani will be issued with 5,527,312 new Ordinary Shares.\no\na one-time fee equal to 4% of the ISC at the time of issue for facilitating and delivering a complete mining contract, covering all mine development and operational activities necessary to take the operation through to at least first 8-years of coal production with associated continuous overburden removal and stockpile management (\"\nMine Development and Operations Contract\n\"). A further announcement will made as and when this milestone is achieved, and the resultant one-time fee becomes payable.\n\u00b7\nDyani will also receive a one-time fee of \u00a385,000 payable by way of 4,688,620 new Ordinary Shares for services, including furthering the relationship with PowerChina,",

(\"\nPowerChina\n\") has agreed to an extension of the memorandum of understanding (\"\nMoU\n\") for a period of a further 12 months from 6 December 2024 to 6 December 2025 on the same terms as the previous memorandum of understanding which is primarily focused on the Phulbari coal mine development.\nOn 27 November 2018 the Company originally announced the entry into the MoU. The MoU was previously extended for 12 months from 6 December 2023 to 6 December 2024, details of which were announced by the Company on 28 November 2023.\nIt is acknowledged that working under the MOU the parties have already taken a significant step towards developing the Phulbari coal mine. This is demonstrated by the signing of an EPC contract for \"Phulbari Coal Mining Infrastructure Construction and Overburden Stripping\", which was announced by the Company on 11 March 2024.\nThe scope of work under this contract includes design, procurement, installation and commissioning of mine infrastructure and overburden removal, dewatering and drainage. It also includes selective mining and stockpiling of valuable industrial mineral co-products that occur in the overburden and are expected to deliver considerable cashflow for the Project ahead of any coal extraction. Importantly, the proposed mine development is now heading in the direction of contract mining which means that the mining is carried out by an experienced mining contractor utilising their own resources and mining equipment resulting in reduced technical risk and start-up capital expenditure requirement.\nWorking under this extended MOU, GCM and PowerChina aim to determine the modality for PowerChina to become involved in other packages of work and financing that are necessary to fully develop the Phulbari coal mine. PowerChina's involvement as a Mine Development Partner remains subject to the approval of PowerChina internal compliance and all other relevant regulatory agencies.\nOver the past decade, Bangladesh has experienced considerable expansion of its power generating capacity. However, it did so by relying on imported fuel and not promoting extraction of its domestic coal and gas resources. Bangladesh's installed coal-fired power capacity currently stands at over 8,000MW (commissioned and soon to be commissioned). This represents an investment of some US$20 to 30 billion, predominantly in the latest High Efficiency - Low Emission (HELE) ultra-supercritical coal fired power plant technology with an annual coal supply demand of some 19 million tonnes of coal of the quality of the Phulbari reserves. GCM remains confident that by developing the proposed Phulbari coal mine, the Country will take a significant step away from an almost total dependance on expensive imported energy.\nMichael Tang, Chief Executive of GCM, commented\n:\n\"Working under the MOU, GCM and PowerChina will have the opportunity to finalise the remaining work packages necessary to bring the Phulbari coal mine into production. It also further strengthens our working relationship and demonstrates our ability to bring the Project to fruition. Having PowerChina as our Development Partner will greatly assist with obtaining the necessary Government approval and demonstrating that the proposed Phulbari coal mine will provide a large reliable supply of affordable commercial energy that will reduce the Country's dependance on expensive imported energy products.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nBen Tadd / Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources plc\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM listed mining and energy company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

The first half of the reporting year was dominated by the run-up to the Bangladesh national election held on 7 January 2024, which saw the Awami League government return to power. This outcome gave the app\nearance of political stability and, as noted at the Annual General Meeting held on 29 February this year, the Ministry for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources was widely reported to be preparing a presentation for\nthe then Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, fo\ncusing on strategies and challenges related to the country's coal-based energy sector. The Phulbari coal mine was recognised as part of the solution and key issues expected to be discussed included Bangladesh's growing reliance on imported coal for its pow\ner plants, which has led to financial and logistical challenges.\nWith the time taken for that the newly elected government to become operational and given the fact that the former Prime Minister was away from the country for approximately five weeks after the election, the opportunity for delivery of that presentation d\nid not arise before student led protests started in June this year. These protests which initially were demands for public service job quota reforms, quickly escalated into a larger anti-government demonstration, that on 5 August ultimately led to the coll\napse of the Awami League government (after consecutively being 15 years in power) and caused the former Prime Minister to depart Bangladesh.\nAn interim government led by Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus now governs Bangladesh (the \"Interim Government\"), focusing on restoring peace and implementing institutional reforms in preparation for fair elections. This government, while widely supported f\nor its commitment to democratic change, faces challenges with economic disruptions, price hike of essentials, ongoing unrest among garment workers, restoring law and order and difficulties in restoring trust in public institutions. While the International\nCommunity is also supportive of the reform agenda and appreciates it will take time to achieve, the political parties that have arisen to fill the political void are increasingly pushing for early elections.\nThe Company believes a new and exciting opport\nunity has been created to work directly with the Interim Government in moving the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\"",

The first step has been that parliament was officially dissolved. Their next step is to quickly appoint an \"Interim Government\". Although the full composition of this Interim Government is yet to be confirmed, it is reported that Nobel Laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus has accepted to take the lead as Chief Adviser.\nOur Chief Operating Officer today reported the situation in Bangladesh is calm and moving towards normality. Appointing the Interim Government is a high priority to underpin law and order and continued development of the country.\nMeanwhile, as also reported in the media over the past months, it is confirmed that the Bangladesh Power and Energy Ministry has prepared a presentation promoting the immediate development of the country's domestic coal deposits (including Phulbari). It continues to be reported that Bangladesh must develop its own energy resources to off-set expensive imported energy products with their inherent supply and cost risks.\nIt is envisaged any new Bangladesh government will need to make decisions on energy supply. The Company is ready to assist and put forward the Phulbari coal mine development as an important contribution towards stabilizing the coal supply for Bangladesh's existing coal fired power plants, which now includes another brand newly commissioned 1,320MW power plant in the Payra area.\nThe Company is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh and will provide further updates as appropriate.\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton\nFinance Director\n+44 (0) 20 7290 1630\nZeus Capital Limited\nJames Joyce\nJames Bavister\nAndrew De Andrade\nTel: 0203 829 5000\nGCM Resources plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com;\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAbout GCM Resources\nGCM Resources plc (LON:GCM), the AIM listed mining and energy company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (\"the Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

The Chairman's Statement and the full unaudited interim report are presented below and will shortly be available at the Company's website\nwww.gcmplc.com\n.\nChairman's Statement\nThe operating environment in the six months ending 31 December 2023 was dominated by the run up to the National Election in Bangladesh held on 7th January 2024. Notwithstanding the intensity of the election process, our team in Dhaka managed to maintain contact with the necessary government agencies and it became noticeable that momentum to develop domestic energy resources is building.\nThe driver for this apparent swing away from the Country's growing dependence on imported energy products is the inability of the Bangladesh economy to keep pace with the costs, given since 2022 its currency has devalued by over 30% and its foreign exchange reserves have dropped by over 50%.\nWith the Awami League returned to government, the move to reduce this dependency on imported energy has continued; the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (\"the Ministry\") is reported to be carrying out rapid actions to define a development strategy for the domestic coal sector. Thus far this has been in the form of internal presentations looking into likely coal production and environmental management issues for the known coal deposits, being Barapukuria, Phulbari, Dighipara, Khalaspir and Jamalganj. It is ubiquitously being reported that the proposed Phulbari open pit development offers the best opportunity for significant long-term coal production.\nAn open pit development at the northern end of the Barapukuria deposit is also mooted. However, with the annual coal requirement forecast to soon reach 36 million tonnes, there is certainly scope to develop more than one open pit operation, given Phulbari's name plate annual production of 15 million tonnes could deliver over 40% of that requirement.\nAt the same time the Ministry has recently invited international bidding for oil and gas exploration in 24 blocks in the Bay of Bengal as it endeavours to discover new gas resources to combat a growing gas shortage and fast depleting gas reserves.\nThe Bangladesh Government is committed to coal-fired power being a significant part of its balanced energy and power strategic mix. The current focused discussions within the Ministry are an important step towards finally delivering Government Policy to kick-start its domestic coal sector and deliver a large volume of much needed energy for power generation.\nGCM is closely monitoring the situation and is looking forward to holding discussions with the Government and working through its Phulbari Coal and Power Project (\"the Project\") Proposal, including the modality for state participation as a partner in the Project.\nGCM also continues to work with its Development Partner, Power Construction Corporation of China, Ltd. (\"PowerChina\") to further enhance the Project Proposal.\nOn 28th November 2023 the Company announced a further 12 months extension to the MOU - Phulbari Coal Mine Development was announced. The intention being for GCM and PowerChina to work towards a mutually agreed business relationship for developing the proposed Phulbari coal mine.\nWorking under this MOU, it was announced on 11th March 2024 that GCM and PowerChina had signed an EPC Contract for \"Phulbari Coal Mining Infrastructure Construction and Overburden Stripping\" which covers mine development works with a value of approximately US$1 billion, necessary to position the mine to commence coal extraction.\nThe scope of works includes design, procurement, installation, construction and commissioning of mine infrastructure and overburden removal, dewatering and drainage. It also includes selective mining and stockpiling of valuable industrial mineral co-products that occur in the overburden such as China clay, silica sands, and aggregates for the construction industry. These co-products are expected to deliver cashflow for the Project ahead of any coal extraction.\nThe \"Notice to Proceed\" with the extensive works under this Contract is dependent on receiving the necessary approvals from the Bangladesh Government and financial closure. PowerChina has previously expressed its commitment to assist with project financing. The Contract duration is four years and overburden removal to expose first coal is expected to take approximately two years.\nGCM and PowerChina will continue to work together under the MOU to formulate additional contracts covering coal extraction and associated activities to achieve our aim of delivering high quality coal supporting at least 6,600MW power generation for over 30 years.\nOn 22nd March 2024, the C",

(\"\nPowerChina\n\") (refer to RNS of 28 November 2023), it has signed a contract with PowerChina\nInternational Group Limited\ncovering mine development works of approximately US$1 billion necessary to facilitate coal extraction at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (\"\nthe Project\n\"). The advancement of this Contract is subject to receiving the approval of the Scheme of Development for coal mining submitted to the Bangladesh Government under the terms and conditions of its Contract for \"Exploration and Mining Coal in Northern Bangladesh\".\nThe scope of works under this Mine Construction Contract includes design, procurement, installation\n, construction\nand commissioning of mine infrastructure and overburden removal, dewatering and drainage. It also includes selective mining and stockpiling of valuable industrial mineral co-products that occur in the overburden. These co-products are expected to deliver considerable cashflow for the Project ahead of any coal extraction.\nThe Mine Construction Contract duration is four years, with overburden removal to expose first coal taking some two years. The Company and PowerChina expect to enter additional contracts covering coal extraction and associated activities to support ongoing open pit mining operations and the Project's commitment to deliver high quality coal supporting at least 6,600MW power generation for over 30 years. A joint proposal with development partner, PowerChina, will shortly be presented to the newly elected Bangladesh Government.\nThe Mine Construction Contract was entered into on 9 March 2024, however, issuance of a Notice to Proceed with the works is dependent on the Company receiving the necessary approvals from the Bangladesh Government and achieving financial closure. As noted in the beforementioned RNS of 28 November 2023, our development partner, PowerChina is committed to assist with project financing.\nCoal Supply Expressions of Interest:\nThe Company has received Expressions of Interest to purchase Phulbari's coal from both of Bangladesh's current Independent Power Producers, being SS Power Limited that operates the 1,320MW Banshkhali power plant and Barisal Electric Power Company that operates a 350MW unit at Barisal (with plans to add an additional unit). These represent some 27% of the present market.\nBangladesh currently has 6,035 MW of installed coal-fired power generating capacity with a demand for some 16 million tonnes of coal per annum, i.e., equivalent to the Phulbari coal mine's planned production. However, the long-term government plan shows an increase in coal-fired power to 11,830 MW which would require some 36 million tonnes of coal per annum.\nThe current coal-fired power plants include:\n\u00b7\nExisting Barapukuria plants 525 MW\n\u00b7\nPayra 1,320 MW\n\u00b7\nRampal 1,320\n\u00b7\nMatarbari 1,200 MW\n\u00b7\nS ALAM Banshkhali 1,320 MW (Independent power producer SS Power)\n\u00b7\nBarisal 350 MW (Independent power producer Barisal Electric Power Company)\nThis announcement contains inside information as defined in Article 7 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation No 596/2014 and has been announced in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of that Regulation.\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton\nFinance Director\n+44 (0) 20 7290 1630\nWH Ireland Ltd\nJames Joyce\nAndrew De Andrade\n+44 (0) 20 7220 1666\nGCM Resources plc\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com;\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAbout GCM Resources\nGCM Resources plc (LON:GCM), the AIM listed mining and energy company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (\"the Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

As the first half of the reporting period unfolded there was optimism regarding Bangladesh making moves to refocus its energy supply strategy away from an almost total dependence on imports to embracing a strategic balance, with coal supply coming from its significant, largely unexploited domestic coal resources. The State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources even spoke in parliament on the extraction of these coal resources, citing that the Phulbari coal deposit is the country's only realistic open pit coal mine option, implying its potential for delivering significant long-term coal production for power generation.\nWhilst indications are the momentum swing towards domestic energy resource extraction is on the rise, physical progress was stymied as political focus swung towards the 7 January 2024 National Election (outside the reporting period), i.e., from the second half of the reporting period the country entered its election year.\nWe have previously commented on the extremely detrimental effects that high commodity prices (particularly for energy products) are having on Least Developed Countries. Unfortunately, this situation has worsened as the world's supply chain not only was not keeping pace with demand from the post-COVID awakening of industries, but has been further affected by the protracted Ukraine conflict and more recent conflict in the Middle East. In the case of Bangladesh, the past couple of years have seen its foreign exchange reserves plummet by 50%, its currency devalue against the US Dollar by over 30% and inflation pushing 10%. In short, this has caused an even deeper austerity move with the central bank imposing certain restrictions on imports, which also caused disruption to imported coal supply, impacting power supply from recently commissioned large-scale coal-fired power plants.\nOur Dhaka team maintains contact with government agencies and has seen evidence that the forementioned momentum towards developing the country's known domestic coal resources and increasing exploration to identify new gas fields is waxing. The downturn in key economic indicators has seemingly been an awakening and it is most fortunate that the country has such a world class energy resource as the Phulbari coal deposit that can easily be developed and help insulate against the vagaries of the world energy market.\nGCM has patiently been working to be in the best position to present the Project Proposal to the Bangladesh Government and would welcome its participation as a partner in the Project. With the apparent move towards finally realising the potential of domestic energy resources, now that the National Election has been completed and the Awami League government returned, we are targeting Project Proposal delivery once the new government has settled in.\nTo reiterate, the Project Proposal focusses on development of the Phulbari coal mine which will have an annual production of over 15 million tonnes, capable of supporting some 6,600MW based on the latest highly energy efficient coal-fired power plant systems for more than 30 years. The Project area can also support over 2,000MW of installed Solar Power Capacity throughout the life of the Project and this is an adjunct to the Proposal. It is aimed to supply power from the Solar Power Park to both the na",

(\"\nPowerChina\n\") it has agreed an extension for a period of a further 12 months from 6 December 2023 to 6 December 2024 on the same terms as the previous memorandum of understanding (\"\nMoU\n\") which is primarily focused on the Phulbari coal mine development. This will allow PowerChina and GCM to continue to work on determining the modality for PowerChina to become a Mine Development Partner, subject to the approval of PowerChina internal compliance and all other relevant regulatory agencies.\nUnder the MoU, PowerChina and GCM will discuss and negotiate a mutually agreed business relationship to partner each other in developing the proposed coal mine based on the world-class high quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project in North-West Bangladesh (the \"Project\"). These discussions will cover key areas of finance, project development and mining operations.\nIt has been reported in Bangladesh that the government is working on new plans for energy supply to feed its diverse range of power plants. The economic pressures, driven largely by the vagaries of the international energy market, appear to be driving a re-focus towards developing domestic energy resources. Bangladesh's currently installed coal-fired power plants of just over 6,000 MW, already can consume virtually all the planned Phulbari coal mine's production and the Government's plan is to double this capacity. GCM remains confident that the Project will help the Country move away from an almost total dependance on expensive imported energy.\nDrawdown Request on Existing Polo Resources Ltd Loan Facility\nThe Company\nannounced\non 14 June 2023 that it\nneeded to carry out an additional fundraise before the end of 2023 to fund its working capital into 2024.\nIn relation to the Loan Facility with Polo Resources Ltd (\"Polo\") as announced on 26 March 2021 and as amended and announced on 3 March 2022, the Comp\nany has requested to drawn down a further \u00a3300,000 in accordance with the terms announced thereon. The Company will make a further announcement on receipt of the drawdown funds from Polo which would extend its working capital beyond the end of December 202\n3.\nThe Company on receipt of this further drawdown will have then utilised the full \u00a33.5million of the \u00a33.5million facility.\nFunds from t\nhis current drawdown request along with existing cash balances\nw\nould\nbe sufficient to fund the Company through to th\ne end of March 2024.\nMichael Tang, Executive Chairman of GCM, commented\n:\n\"GCM has established a solid working relationship with PowerChina on the Phulbari Coal and Power Project. PowerChina appreciates the enormous benefits that will accrue for Bangladesh and all other stakeholder through the development of the Phulbari coal mine.

The Chairman's Statement and the full unaudited interim report are presented below and will shortly be available at the Company's website\nwww.gcmplc.com\n.\nChairman's Statement\nThe environment under which we operated in the six months ending 31 December was dominated by growing negative economic impacts of the Ukraine conflict and, in the latter part of the reporting period, the emergence of a changing political landscape as the Bangladesh Government and Opposition parties launched campaigns ahead of the national election, stated for early 2024.\nThe Bangladesh Government demonstrates commitment to coal being in its long-term energy mix with 11,755MW coal-fired power plants commissioned or in the pipeline. It has also committed to implement the latest HELE power plants (High Efficiency, Low Emissions), based on Ultra-Supercritical boiler technology resulting in smaller environmental footprints as less coal is consumed with reduced carbon dioxide emissions to produce the same electricity as conventional power plants. Progress has been substantial, with Ultra-Supercritical Power Plants commissioned at Payra 1,320MW in 2019-20; Rampal first unit (660MW) in November 2022 and the second 660MW unit scheduled for first half 2023; Banshkhali 1,320MW (2x660MW) scheduled for 2023; and Matarbari 1,200MW (2x600MW) scheduled for 2024.\nThe Phulbari Coal and Power Project (\"the Project\") can support some 6,600MW of Ultra-Supercritical power generation. The Project Proposal is built around supplying some or all coal production to existing (and planned) coal-fired plants and also provides for the option of installing up to 4,000MW new capacity at the Phulbari coal mine site (which ultimately would provide the lowest cost coal based power for Bangladesh).\nOur Development Partner, Power Construction Corporation of China Ltd. (\"PowerChina\"), earlier reiterated their commitment to developing mine-mouth new capacity (RNS Number: 5488E, 11 March 2022). In this reporting period, PowerChina further demonstrated their overall Project support through the extension of an MOU focussed on coal mine development (RNS Number: 2978J, 12 December 2022). The intention is to arrive at a partnership covering finance, project development and on-going mine management.\nThe Project's Proposal has been refined through discussions and presentations at senior level of Government and during this process our Bangladesh team were supported by PowerChina. A significant enhancement is the inclusion of a large-scale Solar Power Park (over 2GW possible) within the confines of the Project area, to be operated in parallel with the mining operations. The Solar Power Park would be installed in stages and it's planned that the power would be supplied to both the national grid and mining operation, also enabling the mine to become a \"Net Zero Carbon Green Mine\".\nBeyond the reporting period, the Company entered into a\nJoint Development Agreement (\"JDA\") with PowerChina and Dyani Corporation for development of the proposed Solar Power Park (RNS Number: 0138M, 9 January 2023). The JDA is comprehensive covering financing, construction and operation of the Solar Power Park.\nBangladesh is on a trajectory to move from being a Least Developed Country (\"LDC\") to a Developing Country in 2026. Key to such a transition is a vibrant, growing economy. The way forward unfortunately has been made more difficult by the inflationary and supply-chain pressures (principally for energy) brought on by the protracted Ukraine conflict. Like many other net-energy-importing countries, Bangladesh has found itself in a position of not only facing persistent high inflation but also a 30% drop in both the value of its Taka currency against the US Dollar and its foreign currency reserves over the past year. This has impacted the ability to maintain energy supplies, particularly coal and LNG.\nThere is growing awareness both within the Bangladesh Government and Civil Society that an over-dependence on imported energy to power places the Country's industrial and economic development in an unnecessary high risk situation, and that the strategy should involve a balance between domestic and imported energy supply. The State Minister for the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources spoke openly for domestic coal supply in November 2022 when he was responding to questions by one of the MP's covering the Project area. The State Minister emphasised that open pit coal extraction was only possible in the Phulbari Coal Basin. More recently, Bangladesh's significant power companies and business identities have called for the Government to move on developing its domestic ",

Bangladesh's pathway to a resilient, pro-people and climate-responsive energy future hinges on urgent fiscal reforms, faster deployment of renewable energy and the effective enforcement of industrial energy efficiency measures, experts said on Tuesday. The call came as policymakers and researchers reviewed findings from a major year-long study at an online dissemination workshop. The event underscored growing concerns over energy security, macroeconomic stability and social welfare, highlighting the need for coordinated policy action to manage external shocks, protect vulnerable households and steer the country towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy system. To counter these vulnerabilities, SANEM recommended coordinated fiscal and monetary responses, accelerated adoption of renewable energy to reduce external dependence, and strengthened, well-targeted social protection to cushion vulnerable households from rising energy costs. The initiative, he said, has already received clearance from the Energy Division and is awaiting approval from the Power Division. Dr Shahadat Hosan, Deputy Secretary at the Energy and Mineral Resources Division, highlighted the urgency of expanding solar power generation to reduce reliance on imported fuels and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves.",

That is why we have talked about family cards,\u201d he said. Tarique Rahman said, \u201cMost people in the country live in villages, and most of them are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture. If farmers are well off and receive fair prices for their produce, the country as a whole will prosper. Therefore, to increase production and ensure farmers\u2019 well-being, we have pledged to undertake a farmer card project.\u201d",

          "content": "If only you'd bothered to actually do a little research... 'One of the Project's most significant impacts is the resettlement over a ten year period of approximately 40,000 people, including around 2,300 ethnic minority people. This estimate is based on a demographic and socioeconomic survey carried out as part of the Feasibility Study involving visits to over 25,000 households in and around the area of the proposed mine site. Around a third of the initial development costs will be spent on the community, resettlement and compensation before any mining actually starts. The resettlement programme will follow international best practice. The resettlement programme will recognise the rights of all affected people and in particular the special needs of ethnic minority people both in the way we interact and negotiate with them and the way the plans are implemented. Wherever possible the impact on people will be avoided. Indeed, the original mine footprint was revised during the Feasibility Study to reduce the number of people who will be affected. Where resettlement does occur, GCM will ensure that no one will be worse off and that each person adversely affected will be fairly and fully compensated.' 'As a result of mine development, agricultural output over the life of the Project will actually increase, enhancing the food security for the local community. Over the life of the Project the mine footprint will occupy 5,192 hectares. However, at any one time only a third of this area will be actively mined and the rest will still be under cultivation (or some other meaningful land use) either in advance of mining or following rehabilitation of the land after mining. The farming community in Phulbari area currently faces a number of challenges including a lack of irrigation water, shortages of fertiliser and poor quality inputs. Drawing on lessons learned through the agricultural programmes developed during the Feasibility Study, and working with local partners, GCM has developed an Agriculture Improvement Plan. This will deliver an additional crop per year and higher yields per crop. Rice production alone will more than double as a result. Specific measures include provision of water for year round irrigation, training and improved farming practices, moves to higher yield and higher crop values and improved inputs including the provision of bio-fertiliser to reduce the dependence on pesticides and other chemicals.'",

This news has heightened investor interest, building on previous positive momentum from late 2025 and earlier this month. Key Insights Project Potential: Investors speculate that the energy crisis in Bangladesh and the need for domestic energy sources may push the government to approve GCM's Phulbari project, which has been stalled for years. Government Policy Shift: A shift in government sentiment towards using domestic coal resources to reduce dependence on expensive imports has generated significant optimism. Political Context: Upcoming national elections in Bangladesh in February 2026 are seen as a potential catalyst for the new administration to finalize energy-related decisions, possibly favoring domestic extraction projects. Trading Activity: The price surge occurred on significantly elevated trading volume, more than triple the average, suggesting strong market interest.",

In doing so, the country should rely on its local experts and key stakeholders to map major energy sources while fostering the contribution of renewable energy to meet its energy demand. The policy should also recognise the instrumental role of energy efficiency and conservation in curbing unsustainable growth in energy demand. While an updated policy vision would signal a commitment to the energy transition, the Bangladesh government should also develop a supportive ecosystem that incentivises the transition. It should rationalise the high import duties on solar panels and inverters for small-scale projects. At the same time, it should reduce import duties on components used in energy-efficient appliances. Any further delay in the energy transition would weaken the country\u2019s energy security, heightening the risks of higher energy costs and supply disruptions. https://ieefa.org/resources/transition-could-ease-bangladeshs-energy-sector-challenges",

The 1,320 MW Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant, built jointly by India and Bangladesh, plays a critical role in the country\u2019s development trajectory. In the past two months alone, it has single-handedly generated nearly 11 per cent of Bangladesh\u2019s total electricity, powering homes, industries, hospitals, schools and essential public services. Yet even this impressive statistic understates the plant\u2019s real significance in sustaining the rhythm of daily life across the nation. The plant is built using one of the most advanced technologies currently available for thermal power generation. The ultra-supercritical (USC) technology it employs allows for higher thermal efficiency, reduced fuel consumption, and lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced. Though built under India-Bangladesh joint collaboration, the Rampal power plant exceeds in technological sophistication any existing thermal power plant in India itself. The world-class machinery at Rampal operates much like a carefully coordinated orchestra \u2014 performing at its best when guided by experienced operators who understand its nuances through years of practice. These are large, complex industrial systems that must be handled with care and expertise. https://www.daily-sun.com/post-logu/852802",

BNP (Bangladesh Nationalist Party) Stance The BNP\u2019s 2026 platform, rooted in its 31-Point State Reform Outline, emphasizes energy sovereignty. * Resource Utilization: The party has explicitly pledged to explore and utilize \"neglected\" domestic gas and mineral resources, which includes domestic coal, to reduce reliance on expensive imports. * Climate Balancing: Simultaneously, the BNP is under pressure from its youth and environmental wings to prioritize climate protection. Party advisors have stated they will not support projects that \"destroy the environment,\" suggesting any coal mining proposals may be paired with strict environmental safeguards. * Sovereignty Argument: Party leadership has recently framed the use of domestic coal and gas reserves as a matter of national sovereignty against external conspiracies. Interim Government and New Parties * Master Plan 2026-2050: A new 25-year energy master plan submitted in January 2026 faces criticism for continuing to lock the country into fossil fuel infrastructure, including domestic coal, despite global energy transition goals.",

Fakrul Alum business owner Dhaka\u2026. Let's be brutally honest: the Fulbari episode wasn't some heroic \"people's victory.\" It was one of the most economically disastrous self-inflicted wounds in Bangladesh's modern history \u2014 celebrated only because we allowed pro-Indian interest to overpower our basic national interest. For years, a loud section of leftist activists, aided by self-appointed \"progressive\" newspapers, sold a fantasy that Bangladesh could reject coal while the entire industrial world \u2014 from China to Australia \u2014 was powered by it. They screamed about environmental collapse, displacement, and apocalypse, yet offered zero realistic alternatives for powering a growing economy whose gas reserves were already collapsing before their eyes. And what was the outcome of their moral grandstanding? We left billions of dollars' worth of coal under our own soil and then spent the next decade begging the world for gas and importing coal from India and Indonesia at exorbitant prices. We crippled our balance of payments, sacrificed energy security, and made ourselves permanently dependent on foreign suppliers \u2014 the very thing any serious nation avoids at all costs. The irony is grotesque: We rejected mining our own coal in Fulbari, but we built massive coal plants anyway \u2014 now fueled by imported Indian/Indonesian coal. We refused open-pit mining \"to save the environment,\" yet 10,000 brick kilns today burn high sulphur content dirty Indian coal and have become the single largest source of air pollution in Bangladesh. And then we locked ourselves into long-term power deals, including with Adani \u2014 ensuring that, once again, others profiteer from our ideological confusion. The world's serious nations don't behave like this. China \u2014 with the world's largest solar network and trillions in reserves \u2014 still treats coal as a non-negotiable pillar of its energy security. But Bangladesh? We acted like a country allergic to common sense. We surrendered our strategic resources because a handful of activists shouted louder than the economists, the engineers, and the realities of the global energy market. This wasn't environmentalism. It was economic suicide, serving Indian interest \u2014 dressed up as moral superiority. Bangladesh was poor then. It is still poor now. We never had the luxury of denying ourselves the very resources that could have powered our industries and stabilized our economy. And the proof of our folly is painfully clear: every time global energy prices twitch, our economy bleeds. Fulbari was not a triumph. It was a tragedy, a glare example of how our leftist politicians serve the interest of India \u2014 and we're still paying the bills of importing of LNG, fuel using precious foreign exchange remitted by our",

His formal campaigning for the upcoming parliamentary election begins the following morning with visits to the shrines of Hazrat Shah Jalal (R.) and Hazrat Shah Paran (R.).

Alongside rallies and direct public contact, BNP is prioritising a major social media push, according to multiple party sources. The party\u2019s media cell has produced a series of campaign videos for release under Election Commission rules, while activists will run parallel online campaigns for individual candidates. \u201cWe will abide by the ban on wall posters,\u201d BNP Standing Committee member Salahuddin Ahmed told Bonik Barta. \u201cCampaigning will be conducted in line with the code of conduct through leaflets, handbills, banners, festoons, and other printed materials.

Bangladesh's pathway to a resilient, pro-people and climate-responsive energy future hinges on urgent fiscal reforms, faster deployment of renewable energy and the effective enforcement of industrial energy efficiency measures, experts said on Tuesday. The call came as policymakers and researchers reviewed findings from a major year-long study at an online dissemination workshop. The event underscored growing concerns over energy security, macroeconomic stability and social welfare, highlighting the need for coordinated policy action to manage external shocks, protect vulnerable households and steer the country towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy system. To counter these vulnerabilities, SANEM recommended coordinated fiscal and monetary responses, accelerated adoption of renewable energy to reduce external dependence, and strengthened, well-targeted social protection to cushion vulnerable households from rising energy costs.

Dr Shahadat Hosan, Deputy Secretary at the Energy and Mineral Resources Division, highlighted the urgency of expanding solar power generation to reduce reliance on imported fuels and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves.",

Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairman Tarique Rahman on Monday said politics should not be about blaming others; rather, it must be about improving people\u2019s lives. \u201cPolitics of blaming will not fill people\u2019s stomachs. We don\u2019t want to confine politics only to slogans, songs, processions and meetings. Politics must be practiced for the welfare of people. That is why we want to do the kind of work that will put food on people\u2019s tables and ensure they live well,\u201d he said. In his speech, the BNP chairman said explained in detail how BNP would take the country and its people forward if the party is voted to power through the next general election. \u201cIf we can form a government with the people\u2019s mandate, we want to stand by all destitute rural families like Afia\u2019s mother. That is why we have talked about family cards,\u201d he said. Tarique Rahman said, \u201cMost people in the country live in villages, and most of them are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture. If farmers are well off and receive fair prices for their produce, the country as a whole will prosper. Therefore, to increase production and ensure farmers\u2019 well-being, we have pledged to undertake a farmer card project.\u201d",

'One of the Project's most significant impacts is the resettlement over a ten year period of approximately 40,000 people, including around 2,300 ethnic minority people. This estimate is based on a demographic and socioeconomic survey carried out as part of the Feasibility Study involving visits to over 25,000 households in and around the area of the proposed mine site. Around a third of the initial development costs will be spent on the community, resettlement and compensation before any mining actually starts. The resettlement programme will follow international best practice. The resettlement programme will recognise the rights of all affected people and in particular the special needs of ethnic minority people both in the way we interact and negotiate with them and the way the plans are implemented. Wherever possible the impact on people will be avoided. Indeed, the original mine footprint was revised during the Feasibility Study to reduce the number of people who will be affected. Where resettlement does occur, GCM will ensure that no one will be worse off and that each person adversely affected will be fairly and fully compensated.' 'As a result of mine development, agricultural output over the life of the Project will actually increase, enhancing the food security for the local community. Over the life of the Project the mine footprint will occupy 5,192 hectares. However, at any one time only a third of this area will be actively mined and the rest will still be under cultivation (or some other meaningful land use) either in advance of mining or following rehabilitation of the land after mining. The farming community in Phulbari area currently faces a number of challenges including a lack of irrigation water, shortages of fertiliser and poor quality inputs. Drawing on lessons learned through the agricultural programmes developed during the Feasibility Study, and working with local partners, GCM has developed an Agriculture Improvement Plan. This will deliver an additional crop per year and higher yields per crop. Rice production alone will more than double as a result. Specific measures include provision of water for year round irrigation, training and improved farming practices, moves to higher yield and higher crop values and improved inputs including the provision of bio-fertiliser to reduce the dependence on pesticides and other chemicals.'",

'GCM has developed a comprehensive Water Management Plan which will ensure that clean water extracted to facilitate mining is a community asset. This water is to be distributed for irrigation, village and town reticulated water supplies, local industries, power stations and the environment. At the end of the mine life, the final void/lake will cover 696 hectares and will fill with water to form a lake. This is anticipated to be a community benefit as the area is partially arid with a shortage of water in the dry season.'",

This news has heightened investor interest, building on previous positive momentum from late 2025 and earlier this month. Key Insights Project Potential: Investors speculate that the energy crisis in Bangladesh and the need for domestic energy sources may push the government to approve GCM's Phulbari project, which has been stalled for years. Government Policy Shift: A shift in government sentiment towards using domestic coal resources to reduce dependence on expensive imports has generated significant optimism. Political Context: Upcoming national elections in Bangladesh in February 2026 are seen as a potential catalyst for the new administration to finalize energy-related decisions, possibly favoring domestic extraction projects. Trading Activity: The price surge occurred on significantly elevated trading volume, more than triple the average, suggesting strong market interest.",

They also think that legal action can be taken against the Indian conglomerate Adani through the courts by presenting evidence of these irregularities. However, the four committee members declined to speak on the matter officially. It has been learnt that the National Committee submitted its report to Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan on Tuesday. A separate report highlighting irregularities in the contract with the Adani power plant has also been submitted, although the Power Division has not made it public.

GCM had money until June/July and were not in need to raise until then- but something has fundamentally changed. -Power China have signed a MOU for two years- there is no longer a need to sign for one year now, things moving behind the scenes. -GCM have raised money now, as the Energy Policy is released mentioning using own coal, just before the election. -The new govt will probably engage with GCM and it would not look good for GCM to say \"Err sorry, we don`t have any money until later this year when we do our annual fundraise\" -New Govt will want to hit the ground running and may ask for updated studies which may take some time but are required to appease the objectors. All in all, this is a very positive development and I expect things will move rapidly over the coming weeks.",

So when you then get someone like the CPD say they want to reduce fossil fuel and have expansion of wind / solar etc the BNP then just turn around and say, well you can\u2019t have it all ways, renewables are not going to cope right now with all this expansion of the north so development can\u2019t happen without Phulbari coal and the electricity it will supply \u2026 The perfect way to get the public on side of the Phulbari project should there be any negativity \u2026.

While there is no official \"green light\" yet, several factors have shifted in early 2026: Current Project Status Government Reconsideration: The Bangladesh government began a \"meaningful\" shift in energy policy during 2025, with increasing support for using domestic natural resources to reduce the cost of imported energy. Awaiting Approvals: GCM Resources, the company managing the project, continues to wait for formal approval of its Scheme of Development. As of January 17, 2026, the project is still in the \"permitting stage\". Election Impact: National elections are scheduled for February 2026. Proponents of the project hope an incoming administration will finalize the decision to extract coal to address the country's ongoing energy crisis. Key Developments in 2025\u20132026 Funding Actions: On January 16, 2026, GCM Resources raised \u00a31 million to fund working capital as it continues to push for project approval. Policy Support: In late 2025, officials from the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) noted that they are preparing a roadmap to allow the next government to proceed with coal extraction, emphasizing the need for energy diversification. Partner Readiness: GCM has deepened its partnership with PowerChina to be ready for immediate construction if approval is granted. Some industry profiles suggest construction could begin as early as 2026 if permits are issued.",

The 1,320 MW Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant, built jointly by India and Bangladesh, plays a critical role in the country\u2019s development trajectory. In the past two months alone, it has single-handedly generated nearly 11 per cent of Bangladesh\u2019s total electricity, powering homes, industries, hospitals, schools and essential public services. Yet even this impressive statistic understates the plant\u2019s real significance in sustaining the rhythm of daily life across the nation. The plant is built using one of the most advanced technologies currently available for thermal power generation. The ultra-supercritical (USC) technology it employs allows for higher thermal efficiency, reduced fuel consumption, and lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced. Though built under India-Bangladesh joint collaboration, the Rampal power plant exceeds in technological sophistication any existing thermal power plant in India itself. The world-class machinery at Rampal operates much like a carefully coordinated orchestra \u2014 performing at its best when guided by experienced operators who understand its nuances through years of practice. These are large, complex industrial systems that must be handled with care and expertise. https://www.daily-sun.com/post-logu/852802",

Party advisors have stated they will not support projects that \"destroy the environment,\" suggesting any coal mining proposals may be paired with strict environmental safeguards. * Sovereignty Argument: Party leadership has recently framed the use of domestic coal and gas reserves as a matter of national sovereignty against external conspiracies. Interim Government and New Parties * Master Plan 2026-2050: A new 25-year energy master plan submitted in January 2026 faces criticism for continuing to lock the country into fossil fuel infrastructure, including domestic coal, despite global energy transition goals.",

Fakrul Alum business owner Dhaka\u2026. Let's be brutally honest: the Fulbari episode wasn't some heroic \"people's victory.\" It was one of the most economically disastrous self-inflicted wounds in Bangladesh's modern history \u2014 celebrated only because we allowed pro-Indian interest to overpower our basic national interest. For years, a loud section of leftist activists, aided by self-appointed \"progressive\" newspapers, sold a fantasy that Bangladesh could reject coal while the entire industrial world \u2014 from China to Australia \u2014 was powered by it. They screamed about environmental collapse, displacement, and apocalypse, yet offered zero realistic alternatives for powering a growing economy whose gas reserves were already collapsing before their eyes. And what was the outcome of their moral grandstanding? We left billions of dollars' worth of coal under our own soil and then spent the next decade begging the world for gas and importing coal from India and Indonesia at exorbitant prices. We crippled our balance of payments, sacrificed energy security, and made ourselves permanently dependent on foreign suppliers \u2014 the very thing any serious nation avoids at all costs. The irony is grotesque: We rejected mining our own coal in Fulbari, but we built massive coal plants anyway \u2014 now fueled by imported Indian/Indonesian coal. We refused open-pit mining \"to save the environment,\" yet 10,000 brick kilns today burn high sulphur content dirty Indian coal and have become the single largest source of air pollution in Bangladesh. And then we locked ourselves into long-term power deals, including with Adani \u2014 ensuring that, once again, others profiteer from our ideological confusion. The world's serious nations don't behave like this. China \u2014 with the world's largest solar network and trillions in reserves \u2014 still treats coal as a non-negotiable pillar of its energy security. But Bangladesh? We acted like a country allergic to common sense. We surrendered our strategic resources because a handful of activists shouted louder than the economists, the engineers, and the realities of the global energy market. This wasn't environmentalism. It was economic suicide, serving Indian interest \u2014 dressed up as moral superiority. Bangladesh was poor then. It is still poor now. We never had the luxury of denying ourselves the very resources that could have powered our industries and stabilized our economy. And the proof of our folly is painfully clear: every time global energy prices twitch, our economy bleeds. Fulbari was not a triumph. It was a tragedy, a glare example of how our leftist politicians serve the interest of India \u2014 and we're still paying the bills of importing of LNG, fuel using precious foreign exchange remitted by our",

You really think Shackleton was sacked for some company buying \u00a3300k worth of shares? Lol Obviously Shackleton was already in talks with Jarvis and Tang must have been informed by Shackleton when agreement for him to join Jarvis was reached. Tang obviously felt the 2 roles were not compatible and so dismissed Shackleton immediately. The question is why? Many of these NED types float about different boards and hold several positions at once. Really its only a paper position to appease stock market regulations. Negatives, board change always rocks the boat and it allows all the usual bs on both sides on these boards to fester. Positives, 1 Jarvis look dodgy and Tang was just not wanting gcm on the cusp of a huge deal with a new 'corruption free Bangaldesh government' associated with their shenanigans. 2 he would not so brutally dismiss Shackleton if he was worried about Shackleton going public on any bad dealings by gcm. 3 might give an opportunity for a new dynamic replacement to join the board. Conclusion, nothing to worry about. The \u00a31m fundraise shares were just taken in about 3 days. The interim govt are recommending own coal resources be used. Powerchina still have the 2 year contract extension in place. Nothing has changed.",

To meet the requirements of desired double-digit growth rate (considering approximate demand for thirty five thousand megawatt of power by 2030), BNP will take initiatives to generate optimal amount of electricity. All types of energy sources available within the country shall be exploited to achieve the desired goal. A regional cooperation framework shall be developed as needed. 201. In order to end prevailing power and energy deficit and ensure long term energy security, a well- coordinated national energy policy will be adopted and short, medium, and long term plans shall be taken up for its implementation. Least-cost generation plan shall be adopted. Correct and balanced energy- mix shall be ensured. Energy source will be diversified. Use of energy efficient electricity will be ensured and quality electricity shall be provided at cheaper and reasonable cost. Energy- auditing system will be introduced for the households, mills and factories and for power and energy users at Government and private sectors. Incentives shall be given for use of energy-efficient equipment, machineries and vehicles. 202. Steps will be taken for modernization and rehabilitation of old and inefficient power plants on emergency basis. Dependence on domestic gas and furnace-oil shall be gradually reduced. Small, medium and large scale environment-friendly power plants shall be established in order to put permanent end to electricity crisis. In future more emphasis will be gradually given on renewable energy as dependable source for power generation. For reducing carbon emission various measures will be taken including generation of power from renewable energy, especially, solar energy, wind-power, geo-thermal, ocean waves, bio-gas and wastes. Transmission and distribution system shall be developed in line with power generation. 203. Fuel price in the domestic market shall be determined in consonance with fuel price in the world market. Energy source will be diversified to generate power at economic price. A new 5 million ton capacity crude oil refinery shall be set up at a suitable place. 204. Effective measures shall be taken for survey and tapping of new gas field and different mineral resources including oil at different places of the country and the Bay of Bengal. To ensure national energy security initiative will be taken to connect Bangladesh with the Gulf countries, Iran and Middle-east countries and Pakistan and India through inter - country gas line. 205. Initiatives shall be taken for least cost hydro- electricity generation, development of inter-country distribution system and regional energy security through development of regional water management and expansion of regional cooperation. 206.

Posters think Jarvis is winding down and will delist shortly and the 10m funds will disappear. Regular GCM poster Ripley94 appears to be invested in Jarvis. I wonder if he has any opinions on this? So why would Shackleton be joining this outfit who are allegedly about to rip off their shareholders? Is that why Tang dismissed him, didn't want GCM's name tarnished by association?",

We\u2019ve had almost no info at all in most updates \u2026 that was without doubt THE best rns we\u2019ve ever had. As shareholders we have 28 days to get out with what little pennies we have left \u2026 and us all selling up makes zero difference to tang or even GCM \u2026 IF the plan is to delist, the shareprice means nothing. So why not just give us the usual standard update rns and let us get out too. So why CW gave us such a good RNS? Why bother ? It makes no sense. And why did someone jump in with \u00a3500k? Again makes no sense at all! Maybe \u2026 just maybe the plan is not to delist at all. Maybe CW was pushed to make way for local NEDs so he knew he had to leave in order for this to move to the next stage. Maybe his RNS was a little \u201chold tight not long left\u201d message to us long standing shareholders .. Maybe just maybe this really is it\u2026 and we can all have that \u00a310 party after all ! :) Also\u2026 maybe delisting polo was part of the larger plan to help fund GCM\u2026. By delisting Polo Tang was able to keeping pumping polo money into GCM without having to ask for Polo shareholder approval. Why would polo shareholders keep approving endless loans to GCM ? Maybe delisting polo was a shrewd move to keep GCM \u2026 the bigger prize\u2026. Afloat.",

          "content": "Building a supercritical coal-fired power station typically takes between 4 and 7 years from the initial planning stages to final commissioning and connection to the grid. The actual construction phase\u2014from the first pouring of concrete to full-load operation\u2014usually takes approximately 3 to 4 years (about 36 to 48 months), depending on factors such as site location, regulatory environment, and project management efficiency. Key factors affecting the construction timeline include: Construction Speed: In regions with high construction capacity, such as China, projects can be completed in around 3 years, with recent projects reaching commissioning within 36 to 48 months. Capacity and Technology: Larger, more advanced, or Ultra-supercritical (USC) plants may take longer to build due to more complex engineering requirements. A 1,000 MW ultra-critical plant in Korea, for example, estimated a construction duration of 64 to 68 months. Planning and Permitting: The time before construction\u2014including feasibility studies, environmental reviews, and site preparation\u2014can add several years to the total project timeline. For comparison, newer, advanced Ultra-supercritical plants are focusing on even higher efficiency, with projects like China's Pingshan Phase II setting new standards in speed and efficiency.",

You really think Shackleton was sacked for some company buying \u00a3300k worth of shares? Lol Obviously Shackleton was already in talks with Jarvis and Tang must have been informed by Shackleton when agreement for him to join Jarvis was reached. Tang obviously felt the 2 roles were not compatible and so dismissed Shackleton immediately. The question is why? Many of these NED types float about different boards and hold several positions at once. Really its only a paper position to appease stock market regulations. Negatives, board change always rocks the boat and it allows all the usual bs on both sides on these boards to fester. Positives, 1 Jarvis look dodgy and Tang was just not wanting gcm on the cusp of a huge deal with a new 'corruption free Bangaldesh government' associated with their shenanigans. 2 he would not so brutally dismiss Shackleton if he was worried about Shackleton going public on any bad dealings by gcm. 3 might give an opportunity for a new dynamic replacement to join the board. Conclusion, nothing to worry about. The \u00a31m fundraise shares were just taken in about 3 days. The interim govt are recommending own coal resources be used. Powerchina still have the 2 year contract extension in place. Nothing has changed.",

All types of energy sources available within the country shall be exploited to achieve the desired goal. A regional cooperation framework shall be developed as needed. 201. In order to end prevailing power and energy deficit and ensure long term energy security, a well- coordinated national energy policy will be adopted and short, medium, and long term plans shall be taken up for its implementation. Least-cost generation plan shall be adopted. Correct and balanced energy- mix shall be ensured. Energy source will be diversified. Use of energy efficient electricity will be ensured and quality electricity shall be provided at cheaper and reasonable cost. Energy- auditing system will be introduced for the households, mills and factories and for power and energy users at Government and private sectors. Incentives shall be given for use of energy-efficient equipment, machineries and vehicles. 202. Steps will be taken for modernization and rehabilitation of old and inefficient power plants on emergency basis. Dependence on domestic gas and furnace-oil shall be gradually reduced. Small, medium and large scale environment-friendly power plants shall be established in order to put permanent end to electricity crisis. In future more emphasis will be gradually given on renewable energy as dependable source for power generation. For reducing carbon emission various measures will be taken including generation of power from renewable energy, especially, solar energy, wind-power, geo-thermal, ocean waves, bio-gas and wastes. Transmission and distribution system shall be developed in line with power generation. 203. Fuel price in the domestic market shall be determined in consonance with fuel price in the world market. Energy source will be diversified to generate power at economic price. A new 5 million ton capacity crude oil refinery shall be set up at a suitable place. 204. Effective measures shall be taken for survey and tapping of new gas field and different mineral resources including oil at different places of the country and the Bay of Bengal. To ensure national energy security initiative will be taken to connect Bangladesh with the Gulf countries, Iran and Middle-east countries and Pakistan and India through inter - country gas line. 205. Initiatives shall be taken for least cost hydro- electricity generation, development of inter-country distribution system and regional energy security through development of regional water management and expansion of regional cooperation. 206.

Posters think Jarvis is winding down and will delist shortly and the 10m funds will disappear. Regular GCM poster Ripley94 appears to be invested in Jarvis. I wonder if he has any opinions on this?

We\u2019ve had almost no info at all in most updates \u2026 that was without doubt THE best rns we\u2019ve ever had. As shareholders we have 28 days to get out with what little pennies we have left \u2026 and us all selling up makes zero difference to tang or even GCM \u2026 IF the plan is to delist, the shareprice means nothing. So why not just give us the usual standard update rns and let us get out too. So why CW gave us such a good RNS? Why bother ? It makes no sense. And why did someone jump in with \u00a3500k? Again makes no sense at all! Maybe \u2026 just maybe the plan is not to delist at all. Maybe CW was pushed to make way for local NEDs so he knew he had to leave in order for this to move to the next stage. Maybe his RNS was a little \u201chold tight not long left\u201d message to us long standing shareholders .. Maybe just maybe this really is it\u2026 and we can all have that \u00a310 party after all ! :) Also\u2026 maybe delisting polo was part of the larger plan to help fund GCM\u2026. By delisting Polo Tang was able to keeping pumping polo money into GCM without having to ask for Polo shareholder approval. Why would polo shareholders keep approving endless loans to GCM ? Maybe delisting polo was a shrewd move to keep GCM \u2026 the bigger prize\u2026. Afloat.",

          "content": "So, i had chance to read through the manifesto this evening. (Rock n Roll lifestyle me) No mention of coal as i already knew would be the case. Which matters not. This has already been clarified as happening by Tarique at the recent election rallies. However. Projects  like ours fall under the plan of turning Bangladesh into a trillion dollar economy by 2034. The other point i found relevant is the emphasis on agriculture & turning the north into a major agricultural hub. Part of GCM\u2019s feasibility study involves increasing agricultural output From GCM website AGRICULTURE As a result of mine development, agricultural output over the life of the Project will actually increase, enhancing the food security for the local community. Over the life of the Project the mine footprint will occupy 5,192 hectares. However, at any one time only a third of this area will be actively mined and the rest will still be under cultivation (or some other meaningful land use) either in advance of mining or following rehabilitation of the land after mining. The farming community in Phulbari area currently faces a number of challenges including a lack of irrigation water, shortages of fertiliser and poor quality inputs. Drawing on lessons learned through the agricultural programmes developed during the Feasibility Study, and working with local partners, GCM has developed an Agriculture Improvement Plan. This will deliver an additional crop per year and higher yields per crop. Rice production alone will more than double as a result. Specific measures include provision of water for year round irrigation, training and improved farming practices, moves to higher yield and higher crop values and improved inputs including the provision of bio-fertiliser to reduce the dependence on pesticides and other chemicals.",

So there's a slight fall back as a few have cashed out for the 1p profit. Will they be kicking themselves Monday morning? Tarique Rahman has big plans for Dinajpur for development, job and wealth creation for the area. He will elaborate on those plans during his speech in Dinajpur tomorrow. Phulbari is in Dinajpur. He's sending his personal legal adviser barrister to stand as MP in the Phulbari hot seat. His late mother Khaleda Zia grew up in the area and was intending to stand in the election in that area. He has big plans for the area. He's already told other areas he intends to dig their coal to fund their development plans. So how is he going to fund his big plans for Dinajpur? Only by digging their coal too. People can talk about all the other coalmines but only Phulbari can be open pit mined to deliver the highest volume coal at the lowest cost, only Phulbari has all the feasibility studies complete, only Phulbari has Powerchina onboard, and only Phulbari can deliver coal in 2years to finance Tarique Rahman's first term plans. Powerchina are also planning and financing the Teesta River project which is also a big part of Tarique Rahman's plans to develop the north. All the ducks are lining up nicely. This weekend could be a damp squib or it could be a monumental game changer for GCM. Place your bets! :)",

          "content": "Building a supercritical coal-fired power station typically takes between 4 and 7 years from the initial planning stages to final commissioning and connection to the grid. The actual construction phase\u2014from the first pouring of concrete to full-load operation\u2014usually takes approximately 3 to 4 years (about 36 to 48 months), depending on factors such as site location, regulatory environment, and project management efficiency. Key factors affecting the construction timeline include: Construction Speed: In regions with high construction capacity, such as China, projects can be completed in around 3 years, with recent projects reaching commissioning within 36 to 48 months. Capacity and Technology: Larger, more advanced, or Ultra-supercritical (USC) plants may take longer to build due to more complex engineering requirements. A 1,000 MW ultra-critical plant in Korea, for example, estimated a construction duration of 64 to 68 months. Planning and Permitting: The time before construction\u2014including feasibility studies, environmental reviews, and site preparation\u2014can add several years to the total project timeline. For comparison, newer, advanced Ultra-supercritical plants are focusing on even higher efficiency, with projects like China's Pingshan Phase II setting new standards in speed and efficiency.",

They responded well mostly to his proposal to pay back those micro loans taken out by poor farmers, and to develop agriculture in the region. In general they seemed keen to \u2018get on with it\u2019 which bodes well for us. Doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019ll be much pushback when they announce the intention to mine Phulbari by OPM knowing the he prosperity it\u2019ll bring. The only people this far who\u2019ve come out against it are the pseudo intellectual knobheads with their cushy jobs in academia. And who cares what they think, right?",

We know from Bangla news and due to the elections that we are potentially closer now than we have ever been to positive news for GCM, and mining at Phulbari than ever before! - BNP have openly stated that coal will be part of the energy mix if they win the election (very likely) - Jamaat have said that if they win the elections (unlikely) that the country should use its own resources for energy - The Interim Government have produced a new Energy Policy and have  recommended that the new elected government take it up, in it they have recommended a massive increase in coal use, saying that imported coal should be reduced, and own coal resources should be used - We know that of all the potential coal mines in Bangladesh, Phulbari is the only mine ready to go, and could be producing with in 2 to 3 years, all others are years away \u2026 - Elections to take place on the 12th Feb, the BNP are expected to win by a landslide - Tarique is to start campaigning in the north this week - The BNP manifesto is to released on Sunday So hopefully now is the time to move on\u2026 Onwards and upwards..

You really think Shackleton was sacked for some company buying \u00a3300k worth of shares? Lol Obviously Shackleton was already in talks with Jarvis and Tang must have been informed by Shackleton when agreement for him to join Jarvis was reached. Tang obviously felt the 2 roles were not compatible and so dismissed Shackleton immediately. The question is why? Many of these NED types float about different boards and hold several positions at once. Really its only a paper position to appease stock market regulations. Negatives, board change always rocks the boat and it allows all the usual bs on both sides on these boards to fester. Positives, 1 Jarvis look dodgy and Tang was just not wanting gcm on the cusp of a huge deal with a new 'corruption free Bangaldesh government' associated with their shenanigans. 2 he would not so brutally dismiss Shackleton if he was worried about Shackleton going public on any bad dealings by gcm. 3 might give an opportunity for a new dynamic replacement to join the board. Conclusion, nothing to worry about. The \u00a31m fundraise shares were just taken in about 3 days. The interim govt are recommending own coal resources be used. Powerchina still have the 2 year contract extension in place. Nothing has changed.",

To meet the requirements of desired double-digit growth rate (considering approximate demand for thirty five thousand megawatt of power by 2030), BNP will take initiatives to generate optimal amount of electricity. All types of energy sources available within the country shall be exploited to achieve the desired goal. A regional cooperation framework shall be developed as needed. 201. In order to end prevailing power and energy deficit and ensure long term energy security, a well- coordinated national energy policy will be adopted and short, medium, and long term plans shall be taken up for its implementation. Least-cost generation plan shall be adopted. Correct and balanced energy- mix shall be ensured. Energy source will be diversified. Use of energy efficient electricity will be ensured and quality electricity shall be provided at cheaper and reasonable cost. Energy- auditing system will be introduced for the households, mills and factories and for power and energy users at Government and private sectors. Incentives shall be given for use of energy-efficient equipment, machineries and vehicles. 202. Steps will be taken for modernization and rehabilitation of old and inefficient power plants on emergency basis. Dependence on domestic gas and furnace-oil shall be gradually reduced. Small, medium and large scale environment-friendly power plants shall be established in order to put permanent end to electricity crisis. In future more emphasis will be gradually given on renewable energy as dependable source for power generation. For reducing carbon emission various measures will be taken including generation of power from renewable energy, especially, solar energy, wind-power, geo-thermal, ocean waves, bio-gas and wastes. Transmission and distribution system shall be developed in line with power generation. 203. Fuel price in the domestic market shall be determined in consonance with fuel price in the world market. Energy source will be diversified to generate power at economic price. A new 5 million ton capacity crude oil refinery shall be set up at a suitable place. 204. Effective measures shall be taken for survey and tapping of new gas field and different mineral resources including oil at different places of the country and the Bay of Bengal. To ensure national energy security initiative will be taken to connect Bangladesh with the Gulf countries, Iran and Middle-east countries and Pakistan and India through inter - country gas line. 205. Initiatives shall be taken for least cost hydro- electricity generation, development of inter-country distribution system and regional energy security through development of regional water management and expansion of regional cooperation. 206.

Posters think Jarvis is winding down and will delist shortly and the 10m funds will disappear. Regular GCM poster Ripley94 appears to be invested in Jarvis. I wonder if he has any opinions on this? So why would Shackleton be joining this outfit who are allegedly about to rip off their shareholders? Is that why Tang dismissed him, didn't want GCM's name tarnished by association?",

We\u2019ve had almost no info at all in most updates \u2026 that was without doubt THE best rns we\u2019ve ever had. As shareholders we have 28 days to get out with what little pennies we have left \u2026 and us all selling up makes zero difference to tang or even GCM \u2026 IF the plan is to delist, the shareprice means nothing. So why not just give us the usual standard update rns and let us get out too. So why CW gave us such a good RNS? Why bother ? It makes no sense. And why did someone jump in with \u00a3500k? Again makes no sense at all! Maybe \u2026 just maybe the plan is not to delist at all. Maybe CW was pushed to make way for local NEDs so he knew he had to leave in order for this to move to the next stage. Maybe his RNS was a little \u201chold tight not long left\u201d message to us long standing shareholders .. Maybe just maybe this really is it\u2026 and we can all have that \u00a310 party after all ! :) Also\u2026 maybe delisting polo was part of the larger plan to help fund GCM\u2026. By delisting Polo Tang was able to keeping pumping polo money into GCM without having to ask for Polo shareholder approval. Why would polo shareholders keep approving endless loans to GCM ? Maybe delisting polo was a shrewd move to keep GCM \u2026 the bigger prize\u2026. Afloat.",

Said director then gets appointed at a family owned firm with a current MC of approximately 1/10th of GCM. Also an AIM listed company. Is there skulduggery to be revealed? Are GCM just pee'd off with the move? It doesn't feel good to me, but the backside hasn't fallen out of the price. I suppose we best get Digit on the case! GLA Danno",

People are taking positions, improving the start position,  but the race hasn\u2019t started yet. We may also be seeing more sensible investors taking original positions out and leaving a free carry.

It admits Bangladesh\u2019s entire future energy plan depends on a huge ramp\u2011up in domestic coal to escape import dependence  a 40 fold increase ! from 0.6 m to 24m tonnes per day ! That is direct from the Govs own Energy and Power System Master Plan (EPSMP 2025) \u2014 yet offers no realistic way to do that.... without Phulbari - the only project that will provide that level of coal at scale and ready to go. The article claims global funding for coal projects is becoming difficult, but that argument doesn\u2019t really apply to GCM. With PowerChina already on board, financing for Phulbari is effectively de\u2011risked \u2014 the funding problem is for every other coal project, not this one. If the government doesn\u2019t green\u2011light Phulbari, a simple question follows: who exactly is going to fund any alternative domestic coal project? Bangladesh can\u2019t afford to do it itself, Western capital is exiting coal, and that realistically leaves China. But why would China back a new, unproven project when a state\u2011owned giant like PowerChina is already lined up and waiting at Phulbari? the bottleneck is political decision\u2011making - timing - and making sure the people will shout for Phulbari - rather than reject it! The article unintentionally highlights a glaring contradiction: Bangladesh needs domestic coal at scale, and GCM owns the only asset capable of delivering it. That\u2019s not a negative \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the setup Read between the lines - the Gov are painting themselves into a Corner - to say there is NO OTHER Choice - other than Phulbari !!",

          "content": "I am just learning about the following this morning. In addition to voting for political candidates on February 12 the people of Bangladesh will vote on a referendum. Information about the referendum is below. The referendum is very popular nationally (polls suggest 90% yes) and even in the North it is quite popular (over 70% yes). Anu Muhammad is campaigning against the referendum, because he does not want the Phulbari project developed. The BNP is asking voters to approve the referendum. Approval would strengthen democracy in Bangladesh and also give the BNP the mandate to renegotiate and develop the Phulbari project in a way that is fair to the residents and will benefit the economy of Bangladesh. The February 12, 2026, referendum in Bangladesh is a historic \"package deal\" where voters are asked a single question that encompasses the entire July National Charter. The exact wording, as per the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order, 2025, translated into English, is: \u201cDo you consent to the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order, 2025, and to the following proposals on constitutional reform as set forth in the July National Charter?\u201d (Yes/No) What a \"Yes\" Vote Specifically Covers While the question is singular, the ballot includes four specific sub-points to clarify what is being approved: 1. Caretaker Government & Institutions: Consent to a permanent framework for neutral caretaker governments during elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission. 2. Bicameral Parliament: The establishment of a 100-member Upper House (Senate) alongside the existing 350-member Jatiya Sangsad. 3. The 30 Reform Proposals: A wide-ranging consensus reached by 25 political parties (including the BNP and Jamaat) which includes: \u2022 Term Limits: A two-term (10-year) limit for the Prime Minister. \u2022 Opposition Power: Mandatory election of the Deputy Speaker and several committee chairs from the opposition party. \u2022 Resource Utilization: This is the critical section for projects like Phulbari\u2014it mandates the \"utilization of neglected national resources\" to achieve energy independence. 4. Constituent Assembly Status: If passed, the newly elected Parliament will legally act as a Constituent Assembly for its first 180 days to formally write these reforms into the Constitution.",

Any potential underground coal mines, would only produce a couple of million tonnes per year, optimistically. Bara produces less that a million tonnes per year. Coal mining is all about \"materials handling\"! As coal is a relatively low density material, a tonne of coal is a relatively large volume compared with \"rock ore materials\". Hence with coal mining there's a lot of cubic metres to handle! So, this always restricts underground coal mines' ability to achieve high tonnage mining rates! Open pit mining can employ large equipments and had no such constraints! There is only one mine in Bangladesh that can produce anywhere near that tonnage and thats Phulbari and the next government is going to need domestic coal is its coming tenure,  not 5-6 governments later. There is no other mine ready to go except Phulbari, and any underground mines are  5 plus years away and as I said can only produce a fraction of what the  Energy Master Plan states is needed.",

The news that sinks or rockets this has not yet truly come, lots of hints though. Feels loaded and primed. Quite fun to watch. Gla.",

What you\u2019re seeing looks like a classic case of social-media reporting outrunning actual confirmed news. Here\u2019s what we can fact-check right now. \u2e3b 1) Is Bangladesh tense right now? Yes \u2014 very tense nationally, but that part is real and reported by mainstream international media. \u2022\tBangladesh is heading into a 2026 election amid widespread political violence and instability  \ufffc \u2022\tThe interim government has struggled to maintain law and order and has detained political opponents  \ufffc \u2022\tJust days ago (6 Feb 2026) there were clashes between protesters and police in Dhaka, with tear gas, water cannons and injuries  \ufffc So protests and unrest in Bangladesh generally \u2192 true. \u2e3b 2) But is there a confirmed Phulbari blockade today? This is the important bit: \u27a1 I cannot find any credible, dated reporting (Reuters, BBC, Al-Jazeera, major Bangladeshi outlets) confirming a current Phulbari siege or highway standoff. What does exist: \u2022\tHistorical protests in the Phulbari region (it has a long mining conflict history) \u2022\tPrevious road blockades in other districts \u2022\tNational election-related unrest What does not exist: \u2022\tVerified reports (today or yesterday) of a paramilitary confrontation specifically at Phulbari \u2022\tAny confirmed casualties, curfew, or army deployment there If something like that were happening at the scale described, it would almost certainly appear in: Reuters / AP / Al-Jazeera / BBC Bangla within hours.

          "content": "The proposed Phulbari Coal Project A London-headquartered company, GCM Resources (which is also referred to in some reports as Global Coal Management), has also proposed the development of the Phulbari Coal Project. On its website, GCM states that the Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCM Resources plc, has a contract with the Government of Bangladesh 'for exploration and mining of coal in Northern Bangladesh'.\" Many in Bangladesh oppose the Phulbari Coal project. According to Asia Energy, 40,000 people would be involuntarily resettled by the project, although activists say the number of people evicted is likely to be ten times more. The mine and associated infrastructure will use up 10,000 hectares of primarily fertile agricultural land. The project would also divert a river for the water needed, pumping out 800 million litres of water daily, and lowering the groundwater in an area covering 500 square kilometres. Dynamite explosion, environmentalists say, would cause noise and dust pollution, increased by the trucks and trains that will haul away the coal to the port in Sundarban. Asia Energy plans to create a huge lake after the project is over, but activists predict that the water is likely to be toxic. The project was stalled, in the planning phase, when emergency rule was imposed in Bangladesh in January 2007, after widespread protests against the mine. On 26 Aug 2006, three locals, Salekin, 20, Tariqul, 21, and Amin, 13, were killed and more than 200 people were injured when law enforcers fired on the protesters who were demonstrating against the government decision to introduce open pit mining in Fulbari, Dinajpur. Since 2006, the killings have been memorialized in annual events. However, following national elections in December 2008, a new administration is actively reconsidering the mine.[20] It has also been revealed that a leaked December 2010 US diplomatic cable revealed that US Ambassador to Bangladesh James Moriarty had urged the prime minister\u2019s energy advisor to authorize coal mining, saying the \u201copen-pit mining seemed the best way forward.\u201d For further details on the controversy over the mine see Phulbari Coal Project.",

This has already been clarified as happening by Tarique at the recent election rallies. However. Projects  like ours fall under the plan of turning Bangladesh into a trillion dollar economy by 2034. The other point i found relevant is the emphasis on agriculture & turning the north into a major agricultural hub. Part of GCM\u2019s feasibility study involves increasing agricultural output From GCM website AGRICULTURE As a result of mine development, agricultural output over the life of the Project will actually increase, enhancing the food security for the local community. Over the life of the Project the mine footprint will occupy 5,192 hectares. However, at any one time only a third of this area will be actively mined and the rest will still be under cultivation (or some other meaningful land use) either in advance of mining or following rehabilitation of the land after mining. The farming community in Phulbari area currently faces a number of challenges including a lack of irrigation water, shortages of fertiliser and poor quality inputs. Drawing on lessons learned through the agricultural programmes developed during the Feasibility Study, and working with local partners, GCM has developed an Agriculture Improvement Plan. This will deliver an additional crop per year and higher yields per crop. Rice production alone will more than double as a result. Specific measures include provision of water for year round irrigation, training and improved farming practices, moves to higher yield and higher crop values and improved inputs including the provision of bio-fertiliser to reduce the dependence on pesticides and other chemicals.",

So there's a slight fall back as a few have cashed out for the 1p profit. Will they be kicking themselves Monday morning? Tarique Rahman has big plans for Dinajpur for development, job and wealth creation for the area. He will elaborate on those plans during his speech in Dinajpur tomorrow. Phulbari is in Dinajpur. He's sending his personal legal adviser barrister to stand as MP in the Phulbari hot seat. His late mother Khaleda Zia grew up in the area and was intending to stand in the election in that area. He has big plans for the area. He's already told other areas he intends to dig their coal to fund their development plans. So how is he going to fund his big plans for Dinajpur? Only by digging their coal too. People can talk about all the other coalmines but only Phulbari can be open pit mined to deliver the highest volume coal at the lowest cost, only Phulbari has all the feasibility studies complete, only Phulbari has Powerchina onboard, and only Phulbari can deliver coal in 2years to finance Tarique Rahman's first term plans. Powerchina are also planning and financing the Teesta River project which is also a big part of Tarique Rahman's plans to develop the north. All the ducks are lining up nicely. This weekend could be a damp squib or it could be a monumental game changer for GCM. Place your bets! :)",

The actual construction phase\u2014from the first pouring of concrete to full-load operation\u2014usually takes approximately 3 to 4 years (about 36 to 48 months), depending on factors such as site location, regulatory environment, and project management efficiency. Key factors affecting the construction timeline include: Construction Speed: In regions with high construction capacity, such as China, projects can be completed in around 3 years, with recent projects reaching commissioning within 36 to 48 months. Capacity and Technology: Larger, more advanced, or Ultra-supercritical (USC) plants may take longer to build due to more complex engineering requirements. A 1,000 MW ultra-critical plant in Korea, for example, estimated a construction duration of 64 to 68 months. Planning and Permitting: The time before construction\u2014including feasibility studies, environmental reviews, and site preparation\u2014can add several years to the total project timeline. For comparison, newer, advanced Ultra-supercritical plants are focusing on even higher efficiency, with projects like China's Pingshan Phase II setting new standards in speed and efficiency.",

They responded well mostly to his proposal to pay back those micro loans taken out by poor farmers, and to develop agriculture in the region. In general they seemed keen to \u2018get on with it\u2019 which bodes well for us. Doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019ll be much pushback when they announce the intention to mine Phulbari by OPM knowing the he prosperity it\u2019ll bring. The only people this far who\u2019ve come out against it are the pseudo intellectual knobheads with their cushy jobs in academia. And who cares what they think, right?",

You really think Shackleton was sacked for some company buying \u00a3300k worth of shares? Lol Obviously Shackleton was already in talks with Jarvis and Tang must have been informed by Shackleton when agreement for him to join Jarvis was reached. Tang obviously felt the 2 roles were not compatible and so dismissed Shackleton immediately. The question is why? Many of these NED types float about different boards and hold several positions at once. Really its only a paper position to appease stock market regulations. Negatives, board change always rocks the boat and it allows all the usual bs on both sides on these boards to fester. Positives, 1 Jarvis look dodgy and Tang was just not wanting gcm on the cusp of a huge deal with a new 'corruption free Bangaldesh government' associated with their shenanigans. 2 he would not so brutally dismiss Shackleton if he was worried about Shackleton going public on any bad dealings by gcm. 3 might give an opportunity for a new dynamic replacement to join the board. Conclusion, nothing to worry about. The \u00a31m fundraise shares were just taken in about 3 days. The interim govt are recommending own coal resources be used. Powerchina still have the 2 year contract extension in place. Nothing has changed.",

All types of energy sources available within the country shall be exploited to achieve the desired goal. A regional cooperation framework shall be developed as needed. 201. In order to end prevailing power and energy deficit and ensure long term energy security, a well- coordinated national energy policy will be adopted and short, medium, and long term plans shall be taken up for its implementation. Least-cost generation plan shall be adopted. Correct and balanced energy- mix shall be ensured. Energy source will be diversified. Use of energy efficient electricity will be ensured and quality electricity shall be provided at cheaper and reasonable cost. Energy- auditing system will be introduced for the households, mills and factories and for power and energy users at Government and private sectors. Incentives shall be given for use of energy-efficient equipment, machineries and vehicles. 202. Steps will be taken for modernization and rehabilitation of old and inefficient power plants on emergency basis. Dependence on domestic gas and furnace-oil shall be gradually reduced. Small, medium and large scale environment-friendly power plants shall be established in order to put permanent end to electricity crisis. In future more emphasis will be gradually given on renewable energy as dependable source for power generation. For reducing carbon emission various measures will be taken including generation of power from renewable energy, especially, solar energy, wind-power, geo-thermal, ocean waves, bio-gas and wastes. Transmission and distribution system shall be developed in line with power generation. 203. Fuel price in the domestic market shall be determined in consonance with fuel price in the world market. Energy source will be diversified to generate power at economic price. A new 5 million ton capacity crude oil refinery shall be set up at a suitable place. 204. Effective measures shall be taken for survey and tapping of new gas field and different mineral resources including oil at different places of the country and the Bay of Bengal. To ensure national energy security initiative will be taken to connect Bangladesh with the Gulf countries, Iran and Middle-east countries and Pakistan and India through inter - country gas line. 205. Initiatives shall be taken for least cost hydro- electricity generation, development of inter-country distribution system and regional energy security through development of regional water management and expansion of regional cooperation. 206.

Posters think Jarvis is winding down and will delist shortly and the 10m funds will disappear. Regular GCM poster Ripley94 appears to be invested in Jarvis. I wonder if he has any opinions on this? So why would Shackleton be joining this outfit who are allegedly about to rip off their shareholders? Is that why Tang dismissed him, didn't want GCM's name tarnished by association?",

We\u2019ve had almost no info at all in most updates \u2026 that was without doubt THE best rns we\u2019ve ever had. As shareholders we have 28 days to get out with what little pennies we have left \u2026 and us all selling up makes zero difference to tang or even GCM \u2026 IF the plan is to delist, the shareprice means nothing. So why not just give us the usual standard update rns and let us get out too. So why CW gave us such a good RNS? Why bother ? It makes no sense. And why did someone jump in with \u00a3500k? Again makes no sense at all! Maybe \u2026 just maybe the plan is not to delist at all. Maybe CW was pushed to make way for local NEDs so he knew he had to leave in order for this to move to the next stage. Maybe his RNS was a little \u201chold tight not long left\u201d message to us long standing shareholders .. Maybe just maybe this really is it\u2026 and we can all have that \u00a310 party after all ! :) Also\u2026 maybe delisting polo was part of the larger plan to help fund GCM\u2026. By delisting Polo Tang was able to keeping pumping polo money into GCM without having to ask for Polo shareholder approval. Why would polo shareholders keep approving endless loans to GCM ? Maybe delisting polo was a shrewd move to keep GCM \u2026 the bigger prize\u2026. Afloat.",

If GCM gets delisted, it wouldn't nullify anything and we would all still be shareholders... it just would be near impossible to trade them. Tang delisted Polo and then went radio silent with shareholders, despite many trying to make contact (including me). If he had one ounce of care for shareholders, a response or update on any level would have happened. I own a fair few GCM shares, been through the highs and lows, and the next few months are sink or swim. Im more confident then ever this will happen now and even with some dilution to make it happen with stakeholders, its a huge pie to have any slice of.....but .....my number one concern is Tang, in reality he can do whatever he likes, he knows what he is doing and has form.",

Many long-term PIs \u2014 myself included \u2014 have been here for what feels like an eternity, mostly in the background, patiently watching and appreciating the substantial body of research and groundwork that has been carried out over the years by a small but committed group for the benefit of the wider shareholder base.

We have not seen a formal copy of the energy plan, but we know the view of those who have seen it and oppose it as it focusing on using own resources coal/gas and oil. The BNP manifesto was not as clear as some would like but gives a strong indication that own coal will be used. If you don't read this board ardently then you may miss some of the jigsaw pieces that are all coming together. Anyhow only three days to wait until the election results are revealed. The BNP seem to have a slight edge on the other parties, but even if they don't get into power the systemic issues still remain for whoever is elected. They need to power their own economy and not rely on foreign resources consuming vast amounts of the countries wealth. MM dropped the price on very little selling today. Holding tightly....",

Looking at the figures on there if you exclude Phulbari then all the coal fields in Bangladesh, including Bara being mined OP, at most produce 7-8 million tonnes  per year and thats from 2033, which is not in this governments tenure. Phulbari alone can produce 15-20 millions tonnes per year, but that includes coking coal , so say 12-16 million tonnes of furnace coal. If you add them all together...at the most optimistic, it comes to 24 million tonnes which is what the energy master plans target is for domestic coal . If the new government are as has been suggested going to adopt the masterplan straight away it's impossible without Phulbari, not to mention the timelines, Phulbari  can produce the greatest amount of coal in 2-3 years, the others it would be 2033 before they produce anything , the conclusion i make is tat Phulbari is the crown jewel of that master plan because without it the whole thing can't work. I checked all the figures on that site because I really didn't know  that output from those other potential mines was so small but they are pretty much correct according to google and wikipedia",

Both the mine and the power stations are on their knees. The power stations are often out of action due to malfunctions, lack of spare parts or the skills required to repair them. One unit has never been operational.

It admits Bangladesh\u2019s entire future energy plan depends on a huge ramp\u2011up in domestic coal to escape import dependence  a 40 fold increase ! from 0.6 m to 24m tonnes per day ! That is direct from the Govs own Energy and Power System Master Plan (EPSMP 2025) \u2014 yet offers no realistic way to do that.... without Phulbari - the only project that will provide that level of coal at scale and ready to go. The article claims global funding for coal projects is becoming difficult, but that argument doesn\u2019t really apply to GCM. With PowerChina already on board, financing for Phulbari is effectively de\u2011risked \u2014 the funding problem is for every other coal project, not this one. If the government doesn\u2019t green\u2011light Phulbari, a simple question follows: who exactly is going to fund any alternative domestic coal project? Bangladesh can\u2019t afford to do it itself, Western capital is exiting coal, and that realistically leaves China. But why would China back a new, unproven project when a state\u2011owned giant like PowerChina is already lined up and waiting at Phulbari? the bottleneck is political decision\u2011making - timing - and making sure the people will shout for Phulbari - rather than reject it! The article unintentionally highlights a glaring contradiction: Bangladesh needs domestic coal at scale, and GCM owns the only asset capable of delivering it. That\u2019s not a negative \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the setup Read between the lines - the Gov are painting themselves into a Corner - to say there is NO OTHER Choice - other than Phulbari !!",

By this entire share depends on very specific conditions. And only that will dictate the eventual direction. From 11p it\u2019s either right back to a few pence or heading towards \u00a31 and beyond. People are taking positions, improving the start position,  but the race hasn\u2019t started yet. We may also be seeing more sensible investors taking original positions out and leaving a free carry.

It admits Bangladesh\u2019s entire future energy plan depends on a huge ramp\u2011up in domestic coal to escape import dependence  a 40 fold increase ! from 0.6 m to 24m tonnes per day ! That is direct from the Govs own Energy and Power System Master Plan (EPSMP 2025) \u2014 yet offers no realistic way to do that.... without Phulbari - the only project that will provide that level of coal at scale and ready to go. The article claims global funding for coal projects is becoming difficult, but that argument doesn\u2019t really apply to GCM. With PowerChina already on board, financing for Phulbari is effectively de\u2011risked \u2014 the funding problem is for every other coal project, not this one. If the government doesn\u2019t green\u2011light Phulbari, a simple question follows: who exactly is going to fund any alternative domestic coal project? Bangladesh can\u2019t afford to do it itself, Western capital is exiting coal, and that realistically leaves China. But why would China back a new, unproven project when a state\u2011owned giant like PowerChina is already lined up and waiting at Phulbari? the bottleneck is political decision\u2011making - timing - and making sure the people will shout for Phulbari - rather than reject it! The article unintentionally highlights a glaring contradiction: Bangladesh needs domestic coal at scale, and GCM owns the only asset capable of delivering it. That\u2019s not a negative \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the setup Read between the lines - the Gov are painting themselves into a Corner - to say there is NO OTHER Choice - other than Phulbari !!",

It promises that unlike the previous government, the new administration will allow for legal accountability and transparency in how contracts are awarded. \u2022 \"Investment-friendly Policies\": This signals a green light to international partners (like GCM and PowerChina) that the state is ready to negotiate, provided the terms are rebranded as \"prioritizing national interests.\"",

          "content": "I am just learning about the following this morning. In addition to voting for political candidates on February 12 the people of Bangladesh will vote on a referendum. Information about the referendum is below. The referendum is very popular nationally (polls suggest 90% yes) and even in the North it is quite popular (over 70% yes). Anu Muhammad is campaigning against the referendum, because he does not want the Phulbari project developed. The BNP is asking voters to approve the referendum. Approval would strengthen democracy in Bangladesh and also give the BNP the mandate to renegotiate and develop the Phulbari project in a way that is fair to the residents and will benefit the economy of Bangladesh. The February 12, 2026, referendum in Bangladesh is a historic \"package deal\" where voters are asked a single question that encompasses the entire July National Charter. The exact wording, as per the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order, 2025, translated into English, is: \u201cDo you consent to the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order, 2025, and to the following proposals on constitutional reform as set forth in the July National Charter?\u201d (Yes/No) What a \"Yes\" Vote Specifically Covers While the question is singular, the ballot includes four specific sub-points to clarify what is being approved: 1. Caretaker Government & Institutions: Consent to a permanent framework for neutral caretaker governments during elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission. 2. Bicameral Parliament: The establishment of a 100-member Upper House (Senate) alongside the existing 350-member Jatiya Sangsad. 3. The 30 Reform Proposals: A wide-ranging consensus reached by 25 political parties (including the BNP and Jamaat) which includes: \u2022 Term Limits: A two-term (10-year) limit for the Prime Minister. \u2022 Opposition Power: Mandatory election of the Deputy Speaker and several committee chairs from the opposition party. \u2022 Resource Utilization: This is the critical section for projects like Phulbari\u2014it mandates the \"utilization of neglected national resources\" to achieve energy independence. 4. Constituent Assembly Status: If passed, the newly elected Parliament will legally act as a Constituent Assembly for its first 180 days to formally write these reforms into the Constitution.",

          "content": "Well considering that  the chap who wrote that is part of the IEEFA renewable energy activist entity and is quoting the  Energy Master Plan I think we can accept that the figure is real.  Any potential underground coal mines, would only produce a couple of million tonnes per year, optimistically. Bara produces less that a million tonnes per year. Coal mining is all about \"materials handling\"! As coal is a relatively low density material, a tonne of coal is a relatively large volume compared with \"rock ore materials\". Hence with coal mining there's a lot of cubic metres to handle! So, this always restricts underground coal mines' ability to achieve high tonnage mining rates! Open pit mining can employ large equipments and had no such constraints! There is only one mine in Bangladesh that can produce anywhere near that tonnage and thats Phulbari and the next government is going to need domestic coal is its coming tenure,  not 5-6 governments later. There is no other mine ready to go except Phulbari, and any underground mines are  5 plus years away and as I said can only produce a fraction of what the  Energy Master Plan states is needed.",

What you\u2019re seeing looks like a classic case of social-media reporting outrunning actual confirmed news. Here\u2019s what we can fact-check right now. \u2e3b 1) Is Bangladesh tense right now? Yes \u2014 very tense nationally, but that part is real and reported by mainstream international media. \u2022\tBangladesh is heading into a 2026 election amid widespread political violence and instability  \ufffc \u2022\tThe interim government has struggled to maintain law and order and has detained political opponents  \ufffc \u2022\tJust days ago (6 Feb 2026) there were clashes between protesters and police in Dhaka, with tear gas, water cannons and injuries  \ufffc So protests and unrest in Bangladesh generally \u2192 true. \u2e3b 2) But is there a confirmed Phulbari blockade today? This is the important bit: \u27a1 I cannot find any credible, dated reporting (Reuters, BBC, Al-Jazeera, major Bangladeshi outlets) confirming a current Phulbari siege or highway standoff. What does exist: \u2022\tHistorical protests in the Phulbari region (it has a long mining conflict history) \u2022\tPrevious road blockades in other districts \u2022\tNational election-related unrest What does not exist: \u2022\tVerified reports (today or yesterday) of a paramilitary confrontation specifically at Phulbari \u2022\tAny confirmed casualties, curfew, or army deployment there If something like that were happening at the scale described, it would almost certainly appear in: Reuters / AP / Al-Jazeera / BBC Bangla within hours.

          "content": "The proposed Phulbari Coal Project A London-headquartered company, GCM Resources (which is also referred to in some reports as Global Coal Management), has also proposed the development of the Phulbari Coal Project. On its website, GCM states that the Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCM Resources plc, has a contract with the Government of Bangladesh 'for exploration and mining of coal in Northern Bangladesh'.\" Many in Bangladesh oppose the Phulbari Coal project. According to Asia Energy, 40,000 people would be involuntarily resettled by the project, although activists say the number of people evicted is likely to be ten times more. The mine and associated infrastructure will use up 10,000 hectares of primarily fertile agricultural land. The project would also divert a river for the water needed, pumping out 800 million litres of water daily, and lowering the groundwater in an area covering 500 square kilometres. Dynamite explosion, environmentalists say, would cause noise and dust pollution, increased by the trucks and trains that will haul away the coal to the port in Sundarban. Asia Energy plans to create a huge lake after the project is over, but activists predict that the water is likely to be toxic. The project was stalled, in the planning phase, when emergency rule was imposed in Bangladesh in January 2007, after widespread protests against the mine. On 26 Aug 2006, three locals, Salekin, 20, Tariqul, 21, and Amin, 13, were killed and more than 200 people were injured when law enforcers fired on the protesters who were demonstrating against the government decision to introduce open pit mining in Fulbari, Dinajpur. Since 2006, the killings have been memorialized in annual events. However, following national elections in December 2008, a new administration is actively reconsidering the mine.[20] It has also been revealed that a leaked December 2010 US diplomatic cable revealed that US Ambassador to Bangladesh James Moriarty had urged the prime minister\u2019s energy advisor to authorize coal mining, saying the \u201copen-pit mining seemed the best way forward.\u201d For further details on the controversy over the mine see Phulbari Coal Project.",

This has already been clarified as happening by Tarique at the recent election rallies. However. Projects  like ours fall under the plan of turning Bangladesh into a trillion dollar economy by 2034. The other point i found relevant is the emphasis on agriculture & turning the north into a major agricultural hub. Part of GCM\u2019s feasibility study involves increasing agricultural output From GCM website AGRICULTURE As a result of mine development, agricultural output over the life of the Project will actually increase, enhancing the food security for the local community. Over the life of the Project the mine footprint will occupy 5,192 hectares. However, at any one time only a third of this area will be actively mined and the rest will still be under cultivation (or some other meaningful land use) either in advance of mining or following rehabilitation of the land after mining. The farming community in Phulbari area currently faces a number of challenges including a lack of irrigation water, shortages of fertiliser and poor quality inputs. Drawing on lessons learned through the agricultural programmes developed during the Feasibility Study, and working with local partners, GCM has developed an Agriculture Improvement Plan. This will deliver an additional crop per year and higher yields per crop. Rice production alone will more than double as a result. Specific measures include provision of water for year round irrigation, training and improved farming practices, moves to higher yield and higher crop values and improved inputs including the provision of bio-fertiliser to reduce the dependence on pesticides and other chemicals.",

Support for Open-Pit Mining: Senior BNP leaders have recently expressed support for open-pit coal mining, arguing that domestic coal must be part of the future energy mix to ensure energy security and reduce dependence on expensive imports. Economic Strategy: The BNP's 2026 manifesto, themed \"Bangladesh First,\" targets a $1 trillion economy by 2034. Party insiders suggest that domestic coal extraction is viewed as an \"economic imperative\" to fuel industrial growth and resolve the ongoing power crisis.",

So there's a slight fall back as a few have cashed out for the 1p profit. Will they be kicking themselves Monday morning? Tarique Rahman has big plans for Dinajpur for development, job and wealth creation for the area. He will elaborate on those plans during his speech in Dinajpur tomorrow. Phulbari is in Dinajpur. He's sending his personal legal adviser barrister to stand as MP in the Phulbari hot seat. His late mother Khaleda Zia grew up in the area and was intending to stand in the election in that area. He has big plans for the area. He's already told other areas he intends to dig their coal to fund their development plans. So how is he going to fund his big plans for Dinajpur? Only by digging their coal too. People can talk about all the other coalmines but only Phulbari can be open pit mined to deliver the highest volume coal at the lowest cost, only Phulbari has all the feasibility studies complete, only Phulbari has Powerchina onboard, and only Phulbari can deliver coal in 2years to finance Tarique Rahman's first term plans. Powerchina are also planning and financing the Teesta River project which is also a big part of Tarique Rahman's plans to develop the north. All the ducks are lining up nicely. This weekend could be a damp squib or it could be a monumental game changer for GCM. Place your bets! :)",

          "content": "Building a supercritical coal-fired power station typically takes between 4 and 7 years from the initial planning stages to final commissioning and connection to the grid. The actual construction phase\u2014from the first pouring of concrete to full-load operation\u2014usually takes approximately 3 to 4 years (about 36 to 48 months), depending on factors such as site location, regulatory environment, and project management efficiency. Key factors affecting the construction timeline include: Construction Speed: In regions with high construction capacity, such as China, projects can be completed in around 3 years, with recent projects reaching commissioning within 36 to 48 months. Capacity and Technology: Larger, more advanced, or Ultra-supercritical (USC) plants may take longer to build due to more complex engineering requirements. A 1,000 MW ultra-critical plant in Korea, for example, estimated a construction duration of 64 to 68 months. Planning and Permitting: The time before construction\u2014including feasibility studies, environmental reviews, and site preparation\u2014can add several years to the total project timeline. For comparison, newer, advanced Ultra-supercritical plants are focusing on even higher efficiency, with projects like China's Pingshan Phase II setting new standards in speed and efficiency.",

Tarique will leave for Rajshahi at noon by air to formally launch the tour, BNP Media Cell member Sayrul Kabir Khan said on Wednesday. He said Tarique is scheduled to address an election rally at Rajshahi Madrasah Ground at 2pm on Thursday. Later, Sayrul said, he will speak at two more rallies \u2014 at Atim Field in Naogaon at 5:30pm and at Alatunnesa Sports Ground at 7:30pm. According to the party, Tarique\u2019s three-day programme includes visiting the grave of Shaheed Abu Sayeed at Pirganj in Rangpur at 3:45pm on January 30 before addressing a rally at the Rangpur Eidgah Field at 4:30pm. On January 31, the BNP chairman will speak at BSCIC Industrial Park at 2pm and at a roadside rally in the Darun Charjana Bypass area on the Dhaka\u2013Tangail highway at 4pm. During the tour, the BNP chief will stay overnight for two days at Hotel Naz Garden in Bogura. Tarique began his election campaign on January 22 from Sylhet. He later campaigned in Chattogram on 25 January and in Mymensingh on January 27. So far, he has addressed 16 election rallies across various regions. Large crowds attended most venues, with some meetings delayed by three to five hours as supporters waited late into the night for his arrival. https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/tarique-to-launch-3-day-northern-region-electioneering-thursday",

You really think Shackleton was sacked for some company buying \u00a3300k worth of shares? Lol Obviously Shackleton was already in talks with Jarvis and Tang must have been informed by Shackleton when agreement for him to join Jarvis was reached. Tang obviously felt the 2 roles were not compatible and so dismissed Shackleton immediately. The question is why? Many of these NED types float about different boards and hold several positions at once. Really its only a paper position to appease stock market regulations. Negatives, board change always rocks the boat and it allows all the usual bs on both sides on these boards to fester. Positives, 1 Jarvis look dodgy and Tang was just not wanting gcm on the cusp of a huge deal with a new 'corruption free Bangaldesh government' associated with their shenanigans. 2 he would not so brutally dismiss Shackleton if he was worried about Shackleton going public on any bad dealings by gcm. 3 might give an opportunity for a new dynamic replacement to join the board. Conclusion, nothing to worry about. The \u00a31m fundraise shares were just taken in about 3 days. The interim govt are recommending own coal resources be used. Powerchina still have the 2 year contract extension in place. Nothing has changed.",

To meet the requirements of desired double-digit growth rate (considering approximate demand for thirty five thousand megawatt of power by 2030), BNP will take initiatives to generate optimal amount of electricity. All types of energy sources available within the country shall be exploited to achieve the desired goal. A regional cooperation framework shall be developed as needed. 201. In order to end prevailing power and energy deficit and ensure long term energy security, a well- coordinated national energy policy will be adopted and short, medium, and long term plans shall be taken up for its implementation. Least-cost generation plan shall be adopted. Correct and balanced energy- mix shall be ensured. Energy source will be diversified. Use of energy efficient electricity will be ensured and quality electricity shall be provided at cheaper and reasonable cost. Energy- auditing system will be introduced for the households, mills and factories and for power and energy users at Government and private sectors. Incentives shall be given for use of energy-efficient equipment, machineries and vehicles. 202. Steps will be taken for modernization and rehabilitation of old and inefficient power plants on emergency basis. Dependence on domestic gas and furnace-oil shall be gradually reduced. Small, medium and large scale environment-friendly power plants shall be established in order to put permanent end to electricity crisis. In future more emphasis will be gradually given on renewable energy as dependable source for power generation. For reducing carbon emission various measures will be taken including generation of power from renewable energy, especially, solar energy, wind-power, geo-thermal, ocean waves, bio-gas and wastes. Transmission and distribution system shall be developed in line with power generation. 203. Fuel price in the domestic market shall be determined in consonance with fuel price in the world market. Energy source will be diversified to generate power at economic price. A new 5 million ton capacity crude oil refinery shall be set up at a suitable place. 204. Effective measures shall be taken for survey and tapping of new gas field and different mineral resources including oil at different places of the country and the Bay of Bengal. To ensure national energy security initiative will be taken to connect Bangladesh with the Gulf countries, Iran and Middle-east countries and Pakistan and India through inter - country gas line. 205. Initiatives shall be taken for least cost hydro- electricity generation, development of inter-country distribution system and regional energy security through development of regional water management and expansion of regional cooperation. 206. Filthy corruption has taken place in the name of in-transparent Quick-Rental power plants where immoral indemnity has been given to cover up corruption.

GCM dismissed Shackleton yesterday and today Jarvis  issue a RNS that he has joined them as a ned. Interesting comments on the Jarvis LSE bb. Posters think Jarvis is winding down and will delist shortly and the 10m funds will disappear. Regular GCM poster Ripley94 appears to be invested in Jarvis. I wonder if he has any opinions on this? So why would Shackleton be joining this outfit who are allegedly about to rip off their shareholders? Is that why Tang dismissed him, didn't want GCM's name tarnished by association?",

We\u2019ve had almost no info at all in most updates \u2026 that was without doubt THE best rns we\u2019ve ever had. As shareholders we have 28 days to get out with what little pennies we have left \u2026 and us all selling up makes zero difference to tang or even GCM \u2026 IF the plan is to delist, the shareprice means nothing. So why not just give us the usual standard update rns and let us get out too. So why CW gave us such a good RNS? Why bother ? It makes no sense. And why did someone jump in with \u00a3500k? Again makes no sense at all! Maybe \u2026 just maybe the plan is not to delist at all. Maybe CW was pushed to make way for local NEDs so he knew he had to leave in order for this to move to the next stage. Maybe his RNS was a little \u201chold tight not long left\u201d message to us long standing shareholders .. Maybe just maybe this really is it\u2026 and we can all have that \u00a310 party after all ! :) Also\u2026 maybe delisting polo was part of the larger plan to help fund GCM\u2026. By delisting Polo Tang was able to keeping pumping polo money into GCM without having to ask for Polo shareholder approval. Why would polo shareholders keep approving endless loans to GCM ? Maybe delisting polo was a shrewd move to keep GCM \u2026 the bigger prize\u2026. Afloat.",

IN ADDITION, MARKET SOUNDINGS (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) WERE TAKEN IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN OF THE MATTERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, WITH THE RESULT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS BECAME AWARE OF INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED UNDER UK MAR). UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE, THOSE PERSONS THAT RECEIVED INSIDE INFORMATION IN A MARKET SOUNDING ARE NO LONGER IN POSSESSION OF SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION, WHICH IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n11 February 2026\nGCM Resources plc\n(\"\nGCM\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nPlacing to raise approximately \u00a31.25\nmillion\nGCM Resources plc (AIM: GCM), the AIM traded resource exploration and development company,\nannounces\nthat it has conditionally raised approximately \u00a31.25\nmillion (before expenses) by way of a placing (\nthe\n\"\nPlacing\n\") of\na total of 15,244,000 new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the\nCompany (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") at a\nprice of 8.2 pence per new Ordinary Share\n(the \"\nIssue Price\n\").\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nEquity raise of approximately \u00a31.25 million at 8.2 pence per new Ordinary Share.\n\u00b7\nThe net proceeds from the Placing are intended to be used by the Company for working capital purposes.\n\u00b7\nThe Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 18 per cent. to the closing bid price of 10.0 pence per Ordinary Share on 9 February 2026.\n\u00b7\nClear Capital Markets Corporate Broking (\n\"\nClear Capital\n\"\n) is acting as sole bookrunner in connection with the Placing.\n\u00b7\nThe new Ordinary Shares are to be issued pursuant to the Company's existing authorities granted at the general meeting of the Company on\n1\n7 December 2025.\nBackground to the Placing and use of proceeds\nThe Company continues to advance work associated with the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh. Progress remains subject to a number of factors, including the securing of the necessary approvals from the Government of Bangladesh (the \"Government\") to enable development of the Project. Against this backdrop, there has recently been a discernible shift in policy discussion within Bangladesh towards greater utilisation of the country's own natural resources. This has been reflected in initiatives led by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, including discussions in March 2025 focusing on strategies and challenges relating to the coal-based energy sector. With national elections scheduled in Bangladesh on 12 February 2026 these developments suggest that a future government may give increased consideration to the development of domestic coal and other natural resources. While there can be no certainty that these broader policy discussions will translate into specific outcomes for the Project, the Board believes these trends are encouraging for the Company.\nIn light of the above the Board considers the Placing to be in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will provide the necessary working capital to support GCM's ongoing operations. These funds will be allocated to corporate overheads, legal and advisory costs, and general administrative expenses associated with managing the Company effectively.\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will help ensure that the Company is in the financial position to advance its broader strategic objectives.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Placing comprises the issue of 15,244,000 new Ordinary Shares (the\n\"\nPlacing Shares\n\"\n) at the Issue Price to conditionally raise approximately \u00a31.25 million before expenses for the Company (approximately \u00a31.18 million after expenses but excluding VAT).\nThe Placing Shares will be issued\u00a0on a non-pre-emptive basis\u00a0utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the general meeting of the Company on 17 December 2025 (\"\n2025 AGM\n\").\nWhen issued, the Placing Shares will represent approximately 4.14 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the Company and will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares.\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated 10 February 2026 between Clear Capital and the Company (the \"\nPlacing Agreement\n\"), Clear Capital has, subject to certain conditions, procured subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Issue Price.\nThe Placing Agreement contains provisions entitling Clear Capital to terminate the Placing (and the arrangements",

It removed a weak, illiquid AIM investment vehicle that the market persistently undervalued, while allowing Tang to support GCM privately through patient capital, loans and board continuity during years when the project was politically stalled and public markets offered no support. Lets be clear - without Polo operating behind the scenes, GCM would almost certainly not have survived multiple funding droughts. Crucially, Polo fading away didn\u2019t strip value from GCM \u2014 it insulated it from market noise and kept the Phulbari option alive long enough for today\u2019s improving backdrop to even exist. Tang has far more to gain by leaving GCM listed. It keeps risk distributed, preserves political credibility, avoids underwriting a binary outcome personally, and allows upside to compound after clarity emerges. A take\u2011private only becomes rational once uncertainty falls \u2014 not while optionality is still being established. Keeping GCM listed doesn\u2019t just spread risk \u2014 it widens the menu of credit available.",

Yes, the price could have been higher post\u2011election \u2014 but it also could have been materially lower, or unavailable altogether. Given the opportunity\u2011driven nature of the current backdrop, de\u2011risking the balance sheet ahead of any political inflection is a rational, conservative move rather than a lack of confidence. Yes, the second placing was unexpected, but in context it actually makes sense. For the first time in years, the macro and political backdrop for GCM is improving: domestic coal is back implicitly in BNP policy, northern Bangladesh is a stated development priority, the Teesta mega\u2011project is moving with PowerChina (who also partners with GCM), and energy security/import substitution is now mainstream political language. Against that backdrop, the January raise looked like survival capital; the February raise looks more like positioning for what is to come.... Management can engage lawyers, advisers, lobbyists, and government stakeholders from a position of financial stability",

I believe that this is a turning point for Bangla, after all thats gone on i have to. Its an investment i've believed in for 15+ yrs. To me it seems as though these placing shares are being used to keep a lid on things but i have no idea why - surely Tang wants the SP higher, i can't see how it benefits him or any shareholders. It could be cash to facilitate quick approval, it could be to let some of his mates buy in, GoB, etc. GCM don't need the cash to keep the lights on as we had plenty of runway...Even with 500m shares in issue GL has to be worth many multiples of where we are now. If Tang screws us, so be it...it will be a shame and i will have totally lost faith in the Markets (i'm close already). If Bangladesh chooses Jamaat or another party or the Election is rigged then so be it, the country will remain poor and the people will suffer. ...if BNP win tomorrow then i think its the start of the re-rate...where that stops i have no idea now but it will be a watershed moment. Never have we been this close in reality. If we sell now then the last 15+ have been a waste, the yrs of Hasina rule, the Interim Gov...all a waste. GL all.",

I suspect the reason these fundraises have happened separately is that since did the initial fundraiser, as more discussions have taken place, they realised actually we need to hit the ground running on this too and we are going to need more people on the ground both in Dhakka and  Phulbari (maybe even in Nilphamari), They don't get mentioned on here much but the staff on the ground in are really dedicated and hard working, hiring new skilled employees takes time especially if it involves relocation. I've seen pictures of the offices in Dhakka and Phulbari and they're not exactly massive. There's going to be big changes this year and they will need the resources to facilitate and fund them.

However, the necessary feasibility study was prepared for the future government, he said.' Phulbari already has a feasibility study done. So if the govt has done 1 it must be for another mine they are proposing. All fits in why several other mines have been mentioned by the BNP but not once has Phulabri been mentioned, even in the Dinajpur rally. And so today Tang takes ANOTHER fundraise at 8p. And as we know the price ALWAYS drops to the fundraise price. This fundraise stinks to high heaven.",

The analysis suggests that BNP and its allies could secure a landslide victory, potentially winning around two-thirds of parliamentary seats. According to the projection, BNP-led forces could secure up to 205 seats, allowing the party to form the next government with a comfortable majority. Jamaat and its alliance partners are projected to win around 48 seats, while Jatiya Party may be reduced to single digits, possibly securing no more than four seats. https://tob.news/big-margin-awaits-bnp/",

The BNP manifesto was not as clear as some would like but gives a strong indication that own coal will be used. If you don't read this board ardently then you may miss some of the jigsaw pieces that are all coming together. Anyhow only three days to wait until the election results are revealed. The BNP seem to have a slight edge on the other parties, but even if they don't get into power the systemic issues still remain for whoever is elected. They need to power their own economy and not rely on foreign resources consuming vast amounts of the countries wealth. MM dropped the price on very little selling today. Holding tightly....",

          "content": "Thanks Digit for posting that link, think the page is relatively new, or I missed it before. Old age ! Looking at the figures on there if you exclude Phulbari then all the coal fields in Bangladesh, including Bara being mined OP, at most produce 7-8 million tonnes  per year and thats from 2033, which is not in this governments tenure. Phulbari alone can produce 15-20 millions tonnes per year, but that includes coking coal , so say 12-16 million tonnes of furnace coal. If you add them all together...at the most optimistic, it comes to 24 million tonnes which is what the energy master plans target is for domestic coal . If the new government are as has been suggested going to adopt the masterplan straight away it's impossible without Phulbari, not to mention the timelines, Phulbari  can produce the greatest amount of coal in 2-3 years, the others it would be 2033 before they produce anything , the conclusion i make is tat Phulbari is the crown jewel of that master plan because without it the whole thing can't work. I checked all the figures on that site because I really didn't know  that output from those other potential mines was so small but they are pretty much correct according to google and wikipedia",

Both the mine and the power stations are on their knees. The power stations are often out of action due to malfunctions, lack of spare parts or the skills required to repair them. One unit has never been operational. Many experts, prior to implementation, advised against underground mining as they considered the coal seams were not deep enough to prevent land subsidence and collapse. https://www.phulbari.org/copy-of-benefits",

If they are buying, then it\u2019s probably through the MM\u2019s PEEL and SCAP, because they have both just sat on the bid between them all day taking any sells sold into them, and most of the day PEEL sat on the offer not letting it rise, so in total control\u2026 By doing this they have left Pi\u2019s deflated tonight because most thought we were going to have a great rise, so will that mean that again tomorrow they\u2019ll manage to get a few more sells in the morning by those Pi\u2019s that have bought in not knowing the real story, before those sells dry up and the MM\u2019s are once again forced to take us up, to get the sells they require to fill their order?

          "content": "Strip away the noise and this Daily Star article is quietly bullish for GCM. It admits Bangladesh\u2019s entire future energy plan depends on a huge ramp\u2011up in domestic coal to escape import dependence  a 40 fold increase ! from 0.6 m to 24m tonnes per day ! That is direct from the Govs own Energy and Power System Master Plan (EPSMP 2025) \u2014 yet offers no realistic way to do that.... without Phulbari - the only project that will provide that level of coal at scale and ready to go. The article claims global funding for coal projects is becoming difficult, but that argument doesn\u2019t really apply to GCM. With PowerChina already on board, financing for Phulbari is effectively de\u2011risked \u2014 the funding problem is for every other coal project, not this one. If the government doesn\u2019t green\u2011light Phulbari, a simple question follows: who exactly is going to fund any alternative domestic coal project? Bangladesh can\u2019t afford to do it itself, Western capital is exiting coal, and that realistically leaves China. But why would China back a new, unproven project when a state\u2011owned giant like PowerChina is already lined up and waiting at Phulbari? the bottleneck is political decision\u2011making - timing - and making sure the people will shout for Phulbari - rather than reject it! The article unintentionally highlights a glaring contradiction: Bangladesh needs domestic coal at scale, and GCM owns the only asset capable of delivering it. That\u2019s not a negative \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the setup Read between the lines - the Gov are painting themselves into a Corner - to say there is NO OTHER Choice - other than Phulbari !!",

By this entire share depends on very specific conditions. And only that will dictate the eventual direction. From 11p it\u2019s either right back to a few pence or heading towards \u00a31 and beyond. People are taking positions, improving the start position,  but the race hasn\u2019t started yet. We may also be seeing more sensible investors taking original positions out and leaving a free carry.

It admits Bangladesh\u2019s entire future energy plan depends on a huge ramp\u2011up in domestic coal to escape import dependence  a 40 fold increase ! from 0.6 m to 24m tonnes per day ! That is direct from the Govs own Energy and Power System Master Plan (EPSMP 2025) \u2014 yet offers no realistic way to do that.... without Phulbari - the only project that will provide that level of coal at scale and ready to go. The article claims global funding for coal projects is becoming difficult, but that argument doesn\u2019t really apply to GCM. With PowerChina already on board, financing for Phulbari is effectively de\u2011risked \u2014 the funding problem is for every other coal project, not this one. If the government doesn\u2019t green\u2011light Phulbari, a simple question follows: who exactly is going to fund any alternative domestic coal project? Bangladesh can\u2019t afford to do it itself, Western capital is exiting coal, and that realistically leaves China. But why would China back a new, unproven project when a state\u2011owned giant like PowerChina is already lined up and waiting at Phulbari? the bottleneck is political decision\u2011making - timing - and making sure the people will shout for Phulbari - rather than reject it! The article unintentionally highlights a glaring contradiction: Bangladesh needs domestic coal at scale, and GCM owns the only asset capable of delivering it. That\u2019s not a negative \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the setup Read between the lines - the Gov are painting themselves into a Corner - to say there is NO OTHER Choice - other than Phulbari !!",

It promises that unlike the previous government, the new administration will allow for legal accountability and transparency in how contracts are awarded. \u2022 \"Investment-friendly Policies\": This signals a green light to international partners (like GCM and PowerChina) that the state is ready to negotiate, provided the terms are rebranded as \"prioritizing national interests.\"",

          "content": "I am just learning about the following this morning. In addition to voting for political candidates on February 12 the people of Bangladesh will vote on a referendum. Information about the referendum is below. The referendum is very popular nationally (polls suggest 90% yes) and even in the North it is quite popular (over 70% yes). Anu Muhammad is campaigning against the referendum, because he does not want the Phulbari project developed. The BNP is asking voters to approve the referendum. Approval would strengthen democracy in Bangladesh and also give the BNP the mandate to renegotiate and develop the Phulbari project in a way that is fair to the residents and will benefit the economy of Bangladesh. The February 12, 2026, referendum in Bangladesh is a historic \"package deal\" where voters are asked a single question that encompasses the entire July National Charter. The exact wording, as per the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order, 2025, translated into English, is: \u201cDo you consent to the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order, 2025, and to the following proposals on constitutional reform as set forth in the July National Charter?\u201d (Yes/No) What a \"Yes\" Vote Specifically Covers While the question is singular, the ballot includes four specific sub-points to clarify what is being approved: 1. Caretaker Government & Institutions: Consent to a permanent framework for neutral caretaker governments during elections and the restructuring of the Election Commission. 2. Bicameral Parliament: The establishment of a 100-member Upper House (Senate) alongside the existing 350-member Jatiya Sangsad. 3. The 30 Reform Proposals: A wide-ranging consensus reached by 25 political parties (including the BNP and Jamaat) which includes: \u2022 Term Limits: A two-term (10-year) limit for the Prime Minister. \u2022 Opposition Power: Mandatory election of the Deputy Speaker and several committee chairs from the opposition party. \u2022 Resource Utilization: This is the critical section for projects like Phulbari\u2014it mandates the \"utilization of neglected national resources\" to achieve energy independence. 4. Constituent Assembly Status: If passed, the newly elected Parliament will legally act as a Constituent Assembly for its first 180 days to formally write these reforms into the Constitution.",

Any potential underground coal mines, would only produce a couple of million tonnes per year, optimistically. Bara produces less that a million tonnes per year. Coal mining is all about \"materials handling\"! As coal is a relatively low density material, a tonne of coal is a relatively large volume compared with \"rock ore materials\". Hence with coal mining there's a lot of cubic metres to handle! So, this always restricts underground coal mines' ability to achieve high tonnage mining rates! Open pit mining can employ large equipments and had no such constraints! There is only one mine in Bangladesh that can produce anywhere near that tonnage and thats Phulbari and the next government is going to need domestic coal is its coming tenure,  not 5-6 governments later. There is no other mine ready to go except Phulbari, and any underground mines are  5 plus years away and as I said can only produce a fraction of what the  Energy Master Plan states is needed.",

What you\u2019re seeing looks like a classic case of social-media reporting outrunning actual confirmed news. Here\u2019s what we can fact-check right now. \u2e3b 1) Is Bangladesh tense right now? Yes \u2014 very tense nationally, but that part is real and reported by mainstream international media. \u2022\tBangladesh is heading into a 2026 election amid widespread political violence and instability  \ufffc \u2022\tThe interim government has struggled to maintain law and order and has detained political opponents  \ufffc \u2022\tJust days ago (6 Feb 2026) there were clashes between protesters and police in Dhaka, with tear gas, water cannons and injuries  \ufffc So protests and unrest in Bangladesh generally \u2192 true. \u2e3b 2) But is there a confirmed Phulbari blockade today? This is the important bit: \u27a1 I cannot find any credible, dated reporting (Reuters, BBC, Al-Jazeera, major Bangladeshi outlets) confirming a current Phulbari siege or highway standoff. What does exist: \u2022\tHistorical protests in the Phulbari region (it has a long mining conflict history) \u2022\tPrevious road blockades in other districts \u2022\tNational election-related unrest What does not exist: \u2022\tVerified reports (today or yesterday) of a paramilitary confrontation specifically at Phulbari \u2022\tAny confirmed casualties, curfew, or army deployment there If something like that were happening at the scale described, it would almost certainly appear in: Reuters / AP / Al-Jazeera / BBC Bangla within hours.

          "content": "The proposed Phulbari Coal Project A London-headquartered company, GCM Resources (which is also referred to in some reports as Global Coal Management), has also proposed the development of the Phulbari Coal Project. On its website, GCM states that the Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of GCM Resources plc, has a contract with the Government of Bangladesh 'for exploration and mining of coal in Northern Bangladesh'.\" Many in Bangladesh oppose the Phulbari Coal project. According to Asia Energy, 40,000 people would be involuntarily resettled by the project, although activists say the number of people evicted is likely to be ten times more. The mine and associated infrastructure will use up 10,000 hectares of primarily fertile agricultural land. The project would also divert a river for the water needed, pumping out 800 million litres of water daily, and lowering the groundwater in an area covering 500 square kilometres. Dynamite explosion, environmentalists say, would cause noise and dust pollution, increased by the trucks and trains that will haul away the coal to the port in Sundarban. Asia Energy plans to create a huge lake after the project is over, but activists predict that the water is likely to be toxic. The project was stalled, in the planning phase, when emergency rule was imposed in Bangladesh in January 2007, after widespread protests against the mine. On 26 Aug 2006, three locals, Salekin, 20, Tariqul, 21, and Amin, 13, were killed and more than 200 people were injured when law enforcers fired on the protesters who were demonstrating against the government decision to introduce open pit mining in Fulbari, Dinajpur. Since 2006, the killings have been memorialized in annual events. However, following national elections in December 2008, a new administration is actively reconsidering the mine.[20] It has also been revealed that a leaked December 2010 US diplomatic cable revealed that US Ambassador to Bangladesh James Moriarty had urged the prime minister\u2019s energy advisor to authorize coal mining, saying the \u201copen-pit mining seemed the best way forward.\u201d For further details on the controversy over the mine see Phulbari Coal Project.",

This has already been clarified as happening by Tarique at the recent election rallies. However. Projects  like ours fall under the plan of turning Bangladesh into a trillion dollar economy by 2034. The other point i found relevant is the emphasis on agriculture & turning the north into a major agricultural hub. Part of GCM\u2019s feasibility study involves increasing agricultural output From GCM website AGRICULTURE As a result of mine development, agricultural output over the life of the Project will actually increase, enhancing the food security for the local community. Over the life of the Project the mine footprint will occupy 5,192 hectares. However, at any one time only a third of this area will be actively mined and the rest will still be under cultivation (or some other meaningful land use) either in advance of mining or following rehabilitation of the land after mining. The farming community in Phulbari area currently faces a number of challenges including a lack of irrigation water, shortages of fertiliser and poor quality inputs. Drawing on lessons learned through the agricultural programmes developed during the Feasibility Study, and working with local partners, GCM has developed an Agriculture Improvement Plan. This will deliver an additional crop per year and higher yields per crop. Rice production alone will more than double as a result. Specific measures include provision of water for year round irrigation, training and improved farming practices, moves to higher yield and higher crop values and improved inputs including the provision of bio-fertiliser to reduce the dependence on pesticides and other chemicals.",

So there's a slight fall back as a few have cashed out for the 1p profit. Will they be kicking themselves Monday morning? Tarique Rahman has big plans for Dinajpur for development, job and wealth creation for the area. He will elaborate on those plans during his speech in Dinajpur tomorrow. Phulbari is in Dinajpur. He's sending his personal legal adviser barrister to stand as MP in the Phulbari hot seat. His late mother Khaleda Zia grew up in the area and was intending to stand in the election in that area. He has big plans for the area. He's already told other areas he intends to dig their coal to fund their development plans. So how is he going to fund his big plans for Dinajpur? Only by digging their coal too. People can talk about all the other coalmines but only Phulbari can be open pit mined to deliver the highest volume coal at the lowest cost, only Phulbari has all the feasibility studies complete, only Phulbari has Powerchina onboard, and only Phulbari can deliver coal in 2years to finance Tarique Rahman's first term plans. Powerchina are also planning and financing the Teesta River project which is also a big part of Tarique Rahman's plans to develop the north. All the ducks are lining up nicely. This weekend could be a damp squib or it could be a monumental game changer for GCM. Place your bets! :)",

          "content": "Building a supercritical coal-fired power station typically takes between 4 and 7 years from the initial planning stages to final commissioning and connection to the grid. The actual construction phase\u2014from the first pouring of concrete to full-load operation\u2014usually takes approximately 3 to 4 years (about 36 to 48 months), depending on factors such as site location, regulatory environment, and project management efficiency. Key factors affecting the construction timeline include: Construction Speed: In regions with high construction capacity, such as China, projects can be completed in around 3 years, with recent projects reaching commissioning within 36 to 48 months. Capacity and Technology: Larger, more advanced, or Ultra-supercritical (USC) plants may take longer to build due to more complex engineering requirements. A 1,000 MW ultra-critical plant in Korea, for example, estimated a construction duration of 64 to 68 months. Planning and Permitting: The time before construction\u2014including feasibility studies, environmental reviews, and site preparation\u2014can add several years to the total project timeline. For comparison, newer, advanced Ultra-supercritical plants are focusing on even higher efficiency, with projects like China's Pingshan Phase II setting new standards in speed and efficiency.",

They responded well mostly to his proposal to pay back those micro loans taken out by poor farmers, and to develop agriculture in the region. In general they seemed keen to \u2018get on with it\u2019 which bodes well for us. Doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019ll be much pushback when they announce the intention to mine Phulbari by OPM knowing the he prosperity it\u2019ll bring. The only people this far who\u2019ve come out against it are the pseudo intellectual knobheads with their cushy jobs in academia. And who cares what they think, right?",

He later campaigned in Chattogram on 25 January and in Mymensingh on January 27. So far, he has addressed 16 election rallies across various regions.

You really think Shackleton was sacked for some company buying \u00a3300k worth of shares? Lol Obviously Shackleton was already in talks with Jarvis and Tang must have been informed by Shackleton when agreement for him to join Jarvis was reached. Tang obviously felt the 2 roles were not compatible and so dismissed Shackleton immediately. The question is why? Many of these NED types float about different boards and hold several positions at once. Really its only a paper position to appease stock market regulations. Negatives, board change always rocks the boat and it allows all the usual bs on both sides on these boards to fester. Positives, 1 Jarvis look dodgy and Tang was just not wanting gcm on the cusp of a huge deal with a new 'corruption free Bangaldesh government' associated with their shenanigans. 2 he would not so brutally dismiss Shackleton if he was worried about Shackleton going public on any bad dealings by gcm. 3 might give an opportunity for a new dynamic replacement to join the board. Conclusion, nothing to worry about. The \u00a31m fundraise shares were just taken in about 3 days. The interim govt are recommending own coal resources be used. Powerchina still have the 2 year contract extension in place. Nothing has changed.",

To meet the requirements of desired double-digit growth rate (considering approximate demand for thirty five thousand megawatt of power by 2030), BNP will take initiatives to generate optimal amount of electricity. All types of energy sources available within the country shall be exploited to achieve the desired goal. A regional cooperation framework shall be developed as needed. 201. In order to end prevailing power and energy deficit and ensure long term energy security, a well- coordinated national energy policy will be adopted and short, medium, and long term plans shall be taken up for its implementation. Least-cost generation plan shall be adopted. Correct and balanced energy- mix shall be ensured. Energy source will be diversified. Use of energy efficient electricity will be ensured and quality electricity shall be provided at cheaper and reasonable cost. Energy- auditing system will be introduced for the households, mills and factories and for power and energy users at Government and private sectors. Incentives shall be given for use of energy-efficient equipment, machineries and vehicles. 202. Steps will be taken for modernization and rehabilitation of old and inefficient power plants on emergency basis. Dependence on domestic gas and furnace-oil shall be gradually reduced. Small, medium and large scale environment-friendly power plants shall be established in order to put permanent end to electricity crisis. In future more emphasis will be gradually given on renewable energy as dependable source for power generation. For reducing carbon emission various measures will be taken including generation of power from renewable energy, especially, solar energy, wind-power, geo-thermal, ocean waves, bio-gas and wastes. Transmission and distribution system shall be developed in line with power generation. 203. Fuel price in the domestic market shall be determined in consonance with fuel price in the world market. Energy source will be diversified to generate power at economic price. A new 5 million ton capacity crude oil refinery shall be set up at a suitable place. 204. Effective measures shall be taken for survey and tapping of new gas field and different mineral resources including oil at different places of the country and the Bay of Bengal. To ensure national energy security initiative will be taken to connect Bangladesh with the Gulf countries, Iran and Middle-east countries and Pakistan and India through inter - country gas line. 205. Initiatives shall be taken for least cost hydro- electricity generation, development of inter-country distribution system and regional energy security through development of regional water management and expansion of regional cooperation. 206.

Posters think Jarvis is winding down and will delist shortly and the 10m funds will disappear. Regular GCM poster Ripley94 appears to be invested in Jarvis. I wonder if he has any opinions on this? So why would Shackleton be joining this outfit who are allegedly about to rip off their shareholders? Is that why Tang dismissed him, didn't want GCM's name tarnished by association?",

We\u2019ve had almost no info at all in most updates \u2026 that was without doubt THE best rns we\u2019ve ever had. As shareholders we have 28 days to get out with what little pennies we have left \u2026 and us all selling up makes zero difference to tang or even GCM \u2026 IF the plan is to delist, the shareprice means nothing. So why not just give us the usual standard update rns and let us get out too. So why CW gave us such a good RNS? Why bother ? It makes no sense. And why did someone jump in with \u00a3500k? Again makes no sense at all! Maybe \u2026 just maybe the plan is not to delist at all. Maybe CW was pushed to make way for local NEDs so he knew he had to leave in order for this to move to the next stage. Maybe his RNS was a little \u201chold tight not long left\u201d message to us long standing shareholders .. Maybe just maybe this really is it\u2026 and we can all have that \u00a310 party after all ! :) Also\u2026 maybe delisting polo was part of the larger plan to help fund GCM\u2026. By delisting Polo Tang was able to keeping pumping polo money into GCM without having to ask for Polo shareholder approval. Why would polo shareholders keep approving endless loans to GCM ? Maybe delisting polo was a shrewd move to keep GCM \u2026 the bigger prize\u2026. Afloat.",

So the longer BVI are stalling on reinstating Polo is good for shareholders right now. Just need a quick replacement for Shackleton.",
