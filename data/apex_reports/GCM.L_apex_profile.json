PowerChina's involvement as a Mine Development Partner remains subject to the approval of PowerChina internal compliance and all other relevant regulatory agencies.\nOver the past decade, Bangladesh has experienced considerable expansion of its power generating capacity. However, it did so by relying on imported fuel and not promoting extraction of its domestic coal and gas resources. Bangladesh's installed coal-fired power capacity currently stands at over 8,000MW (commissioned and soon to be commissioned). This represents an investment of some US$20 to 30 billion, predominantly in the latest High Efficiency - Low Emission (HELE) ultra-supercritical coal fired power plant technology with an annual coal supply demand of some 19 million tonnes of coal of the quality of the Phulbari reserves. GCM remains confident that by developing the proposed Phulbari coal mine, the Country will take a significant step away from an almost total dependance on expensive imported energy.\nMichael Tang, Chief Executive of GCM, commented\n:\n\"Working under the MOU, GCM and PowerChina will have the opportunity to finalise the remaining work packages necessary to bring the Phulbari coal mine into production.

Together with credible, internationally recognised strategic development partners, GCM aims to deliver a practical power solution to provide the cheapest coal-fired electricity in the country, in a manner amenable to the Government of\u00a0Bangladesh.\nNon-Executive Chairman's Statement\nNational Transition and Energy Realities\nThe Board presents the Company's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2025, with this period being\namong the most momentous in Bangladesh's modern history. The unexpected eruption of student-led protests in mid-2024 catalysed the end of th\ne fifteen-year Awami League government of Sheikh Hasina. Initially sparked by discontent over government job quotas, the protests quickly expanded into a nationwide movement demanding systemic reform and an end to long-standing political dominance. The rap\nid escalation, and the scale of public mobilisation, ultimately forced the Prime Minister to step down and leave the country in early August 2024.\nIn the aftermath, an Interim Government under the leadership of Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus was install\ned with the twin mandates of restoring stability and laying the groundwork for credible democratic elections. This administration has pursued institutional reform, re-establishment of rule of law, and re-evaluation of national economic priorities, includin\ng the future of domestic energy and resource development. The Coal Development Forum convened by the Interim Government on 27 February 2025 was a key milestone, reaching a clear consensus that Bangladesh must utilise its own coal resources to secure afford\nable and sustainable energy supply. The Forum recognised GCM's proposed Phulbari Coal and Power Project as the most advanced and immediately implementable opportunity to achieve this objective.\nThe Interim Government continued with initiatives to assist a democratically elected government move forward with domestic coal sector development with the posting of\na\nPolicy on Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector on the\nBPDB (Bangladesh Power Development Board) website\n. This introduces several key proposals aimed at increasing private investment in power generation and signals a shift away from the traditional IPP (Independent Power Producer) model, where the government o\nr BPDB is the sole buyer under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Significantly:\n\u00b7\nThe policy explicitly grants Merchant Power Plants the first right to develop a supporting coal mine, if the power plant is based on coal.\n\u00b7\nSurplus Power can be sol\nd directly to customers.\n\u00b7\nOpens the possibility for surplus coal to also be sold to other power plants, as it is implied that the intent of the government is to reduce dependency on imported coal.\n\u00b7\nEncourages foreign investors to participate without the need\nof a local partner.\nThen\non 27 August 2025, BIDA (Bangladesh Investment Development Authority) issued a press release regarding Foreign Direct Investment, citing energy diversification including local coal. It quoted the Energy Adviser as stating the cou\nntry has coal reserves under the ground and that they are preparing a document that will allow the next government to proceed with coal extraction. It further stated that there must be energy diversification and that they needed to pursue the use of gas, c\noal, solar, and nuclear and also improve logistics to bring down import costs. An updated Integrated Master Plan is expected to be completed by December 2025 and it will provide a roadmap for the power and energy sector.\nEconomic Context and Energy Challe\nnges\nThe transition period has inevitably brought economic headwinds. Growth has moderated as investor confidence and industrial output adjusted to the new political environment. The Bangladesh Taka has faced depreciation pressures, inflation has remained above\n10 percent, and foreign-exchange reserves have come under strain due to the high cost of imported energy. The country's dependence on imported fuels-especially coal-has sharply increased power generation costs and created recurring shortages that have con\nstrained industrial productivity and reduced public service reliability.\nBangladesh currently imports nearly all of its thermal coal requirements, primarily from Indonesia. This dependency exposes the power sector to global price fluctuations, freight cos\nts, and hard-currency outflows estimated at several billion US dollars annually. These factors underline the strategic and economic necessity of developing a secure domestic coal supply, capable of underpinning the nation's 8 GW of installed and planned co\nal-fired power generation capacity.\nThe GCM Phulbari Coal and Power Project\nAmid these challenges, GCM Resources Plc continues to position itself as the leading solution provider for Bangladesh's long-term energy security. The Company's integrated coal mi\nne and power generation project at Phulbari is designed to produce over 15 million tonnes per annum of high-quality, high-energy thermal coal. This resource alone could supply up to 60 percent of the country's coal-fired power generation, equivalent to aro\nund 8,000 MW of modern HELE ultra-supercritical plants, representing an investment of US $25 to 30 billion in national infrastructure.\nThe Project offers compelling national benefits:\n\u00b7\nForeign exchange savings of several billion US dollars annually, by displacing imported coal.\n\u00b7\nFiscal returns exceeding US $8 billion to the Government over a 35-year project life through taxes and royalties.\n\u00b7\nThousands of new jobs across mining, logistics,\nengineering, and support industries.\n\u00b7\nEnergy cost stability supporting industrial competitiveness and public amenity.\n\u00b7\nIntegration of 2 GW of solar power on the mine site from startup, enabling a Net-Zero emission mining operation.\n\u00b7\n30 percent reduction in g\nreenhouse gas emissions compared with the use of imported coal, due to higher energy efficiency and shorter logistics chain.\nProgress and Strategic Developments\nThroughout the reporting period, GCM maintained strong operational and technical readiness whi\nle continuing its engagement with policymakers, stakeholders, and strategic partners. The Company completed a significant update to its Project Economic Model, confirming the financial robustness of the Project and reinforcing its attractiveness under curr\nent market conditions. The updated analysis demonstrates an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 20-30 percent, for the project equity reflecting improved capital efficiency and strong cash flow potential once operations commence.\nA key advancement during the\nyear was the adoption of a contract-mining model, reducing initial capital expenditure and accelerating early production readiness. This structure provides operational flexibility while leveraging the expertise of major international mining contractors. I\nn line with this strategy, GCM has executed an EPC contract with its development partner,\nPowerChina, covering mine infrastructure development and overburden removal to access coal seams. This partnership underscores the Project's technical credibility and\nits readiness for immediate mobilisation upon Government approval.\nOther steps taken in Financial Year 2025 include:\n\u00b7\nOn 8 August 2024, the Company announced that\nits Chief Operating Officer remained with its staff in Dhaka during the country-wide student led protests and that with the appointment of the Interim Government, the situation in Bangladesh was calm and moving towards normality. It also noted that media r\neports over the past months confirmed that the Bangladesh Power and Energy Ministry has prepared a presentation promoting the immediate development of the country's domestic coal deposits (including Phulbari). It continues to be reported that Bangladesh mu\nst develop its own energy resources to off-set expensive imported energy products with their inherent supply and cost risks.\n\u00b7\nOn 15 November 2024, the Company announced it had received a notice of resignation from Zeus Capital Limited and that it had appoin\nted Allenby Capital Limited as the Company's Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker with immediate effect.\n\u00b7\nOn 26 November 2024, the Company announced that Gary Lye had stepped down as an Executive Director of the Company with immediate effect and that he woul\nd continue to focus on overseeing the Company's operations in Bangladesh in the capacity as GCM's non-board Chief Operating Officer and continue to act as Chief Executive Officer of GCM 's subsidiary, Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Ltd.\n\u00b7\nOn 13 De\ncember 2024, the Company announced that Power Construction Corporation of China, Ltd. (\"PowerChina\") had agreed to an extension of the memorandum of understanding (\"MoU\") for a period of a further 12 months from 6 December 2024 to 6 December 2025 on the sa\nme terms as the previous memorandum of understanding which is primarily focused on the Phulbari coal mine development. It is acknowledged that working under the MOU the parties have already taken a significant step towards developing the Phulbari coal mine\n. This is demonstrated by the signing of an EPC contract for \"Phulbari Coal Mining Infrastructure Construction and Overburden Stripping\", which was announced by the Company on 11 March 2024. The scope of work under this contract includes design, procuremen\nt, installation and commissioning of mine infrastructure and overburden removal, dewatering and drainage. It also includes selective mining and stockpiling of valuable industrial mineral co-products that occur in the overburden and are expected to deliver\nconsiderable cashflow for the Project ahead of any coal extraction. Importantly, the proposed mine development is now heading in the direction of contract mining which means that the mining is carried out by an experienced mining contractor utilising their\nown resources and mining equipment resulting in reduced technical risk and start-up capital expenditure requirement.\n\u00b7\nOn 8 January 2025, the Company announced that it has agreed a new consulting agreement with Dyani Corporation, Ltd. (\"Dyani\") (the \"Dyani\nAgreement\"), to maintain and develop the Company's relationship with our key partner, PowerChina, on similar terms as previously announced. The Dyani Agreement was most recently extended on 29 June 2020 and expired on 30 June 2022. Under the terms of this\nlatest Dyani Agreement, which will expire on 31 December 2025, Dyani shall provide services to assist the Company to: Promote the Project; grow its relationship with its key development partner, PowerChina; facilitate PowerChina's assistance in achieving\nproject approval from the Government of Bangladesh and securing finance necessary to take the Project to the stage of coal extraction with positive cashflow; and Identify additional project opportunities that represent business opportunities for GCM that c\nould be developed as adjuncts to the Project.\n\u00b7\nOn 28 January 2025, the Company announced that it had agreed a new consulting agreement with DG Infratech Pte Ltd (\"DGI\"), a Bangladeshi controlled company, to help GCM obtain the consent of the Government of B\nangladesh to develop the proposed Phulbari Coal and Power Project. The most recent extension of the DGI Agreement was announced on 22 August 2022 and subsequently expired on 31 December 2023. Under the terms of this latest Agreement which will expire on 31\nDecember 2025, DGI shall continue to provide advisory, management, lobbying and consultancy services in relation to the affairs of the Company and in doing so will deliver approvals and the cooperation of necessary stakeholders to develop the Project. In\naddition, the scope has now also been expanded to include an adjunct project, a Solar Power Park of up to 4,500MW ultimate capacity installed at the Project site.\n\u00b7\nOn 28 March 2025, the Company announced that it had conditionally raised approximately \u00a31.0 m\nillion (before expenses) by way of a placing (the \"Placing\") of a total of 33,333,333 new ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at a price of 3.0 pence per new Ordinary Share (the \"Issue Price\"). The Issue Price represented a d\niscount of approximately 16 per cent to the closing mid-market price of 3.60 pence per Ordinary Share on 27 March 2025. The net proceeds from the Placing are intended to be used by the Company for working capital.\n\u00b7\nOn 26 June 2025, the Company announced the\nManagement had become aware that Polo Resources Ltd, a British Virgin Islands (\"BVI\") incorporated company, was dissolved on 5 September 2023 as the result of the resignation of its BVI agent. The Company has been informed that the officers of Polo are cu\nrrently undertaking steps to restore its status as a registered company in the BVI including the appointment of a new BVI agent. This is expected to occur following, inter alia, the satisfactory completion of customary due diligence on Polo and its stakeho\nlders by the new BVI agent, followed by a court order as required under the laws of the BVI. Notwithstanding this, there can be no certainty that Polo will be restored as a registered company in the BVI, nor as to the timing of any such restoration. As mos\nt recently announced on 31 March 2025, Polo has provided a \u00a33.5 million loan facility to the Company of which as at 31 December 2024, \u00a3300,000 remained undrawn. In light of this, the board of directors of GCM believes that the status of the Company's indeb\ntedness to Polo is uncertain but given the expectation that the officers of Polo will restore Polo as a registered company in the BVI, the board is currently treating the loan which, at 30 June 2025 amounted to \u00a36,198,000 (31 December 2024: \u00a35,923,000) inc\nluding loan interest, as unaffected.\nOutlook and Engagement with Government\nThe Company enters the coming year with a renewed sense of purpose and confidence. The Interim Government's February 2025 Coal Development Forum set a clear policy direction that domestic coal extraction must proceed to ensure national energy resilience. G\nCM's Project, being fully studied, internationally benchmarked, and environmentally compliant, stands as the most advanced and deliverable domestic coal project in Bangladesh.\nWith national elections expected in early 2026, GCM's strategic focus is on con\nstructive engagement with policymakers, energy planners, and development partners to secure the necessary approvals to move into implementation. The Company believes the newly elected administration will recognise the urgent imperative to reduce import dep\nendency, stabilise the power sector, and revitalise industrial growth through the utilisation of Bangladesh's own natural resources.\nClosing Remarks\nIn closing, I wish to acknowledge the unwavering support of our shareholders, partners, and dedicated team\n. Despite an extended period of political transition and market uncertainty, GCM Resources Plc has maintained its financial discipline, strengthened its project economics, and deepened its partnerships. The outlook for the Company-and for Bangladesh's ener\ngy future-is increasingly promising.\nWe remain confident that, with government approval and continued investor support, the Phulbari Coal and Power Project will become a cornerstone of Bangladesh's energy independence, industrial growth, and sustainable d\nevelopment for decades to come.\nPaul Shackleton\nNon-Executive Chairman\n21 November 2025\nGroup Strategic Report\nStrategy and Business Model\nGCM is strategically positioned with a globally significant energy project at a pivotal time in Bangladesh's economic transformation. With strong fundamentals, updated economics, and aligned national policy, the Phulbari Project offers long-term value crea\ntion potential for investors.\nThe Company remains focused on securing government approval to advance the Phulbari Coal Project into a world-class, large-scale open-pit coal mine in northwest Bangladesh. Strategically designed to support up to 6,600MW of h\nigh-efficiency, low-emission Ultra-Supercritical (HELE) power generation, the Project positions GCM as a central player in meeting Bangladesh's long-term energy demand and industrial growth.\nIn response to macroeconomic pressures in Bangladesh-including c\nurrency devaluation and foreign reserve constraints-GCM has updated the Project's economic model to strengthen local market alignment and enhance resilience. The revised approach prioritises domestic sales of high-energy thermal coal in local currency, ali\ngning revenues with a significant portion of project costs. Foreign exchange requirements are to be met through the export of Semi-Soft Coking Coal (SSCC), recovered via a coal wash plant that also produces a high-quality thermal product for the local mark\net.\nThis updated model was developed in partnership with global consultancy SLR Consulting Limited, which integrated scenario-based flexibility and enhanced the Project's risk-adjusted economic attractiveness. Key variables-such as mining method, product\nmix, transport logistics, and coal handling-can now be dynamically assessed to optimise financial outcomes. SLR Consulting absorbed the consulting group that worked on the Project's feasibility study and have maintained the studies and model.\nComplement\ning the coal operation is a major renewables initiative: a phased development of a 2,000MW solar power park, supplying power to both the mine and national grid. This dual-energy model supports the Project's ambition to be classified as a \"Green Mine\" with\nnet-zero operational emissions, providing significant ESG appeal.\nStrategic Priorities for Value Creation\n1.\nGovernment Approval & Development\nFinalising government approval remains the near-term priority. GCM and its strategic partner, PowerChina, are positioned to develop, finance, and operate the full integrated project over its 35+ year life.\n2.\nDomestic Energy Security\nThe Project offers a long\n-term, low-cost, secure domestic coal supply-reducing Bangladesh's reliance on imports and insulating against global energy market volatility.\n3.\nPartnership-Led Execution\nTo ensure efficient delivery and mitigate execution risk, GCM will establish Joint Vent\nures in key areas such as coal transport and mineral co-product recovery-unlocking early-stage revenue and improving long-term project economics.\nBusiness Model Built for Resilience and Scale\nGCM's model is structured around two core operating units and two strategic joint ventures:\n1. Mining Company\n\u00b7\nDevelop and operate the Phulbari coal mine, with a focus on building a secure domestic market and maximising cash flow through product flexibility\nand local currency sales.\n2. Power Company\n\u00b7\nDevelop and operate a proposed 4,000MW Ultra-Supercritical power station near the mine, in partnership with PowerChina, alongside the large-scale solar power park to reduce operating costs and carbon intensity.\n3. Coal Transport JV\n\u00b7\nFund and manage infrastructure upgrades (rail, rolling stock, barges) to ensure cost-effective, scalable coal delivery to domestic and export markets.\n4. Industrial Mineral JV\n\u00b7\nExtract and monetise high-value mineral co-products from mine overburden (e.g. gravel, sands, clay), unlocking an estimated US$10+ billion in early revenue and supporting local industry.\nStrategic Impact for Investors\nGCM's updated strategy is designed to deliver:\n\u00b7\nRobust Cash Flow\n: Strong margins driven by low-cost domestic operations, diversified revenue (thermal coal, SSCC, minerals), and favourable foreign exchange alignment.\n\u00b7\nScalable Growth\n: Long-life resource suppo\nrting 35+ years of operations with integrated infrastructure and power development.\n\u00b7\nDe-risked Execution\n: Backed by technical and strategic partners including PowerChina and SLR Consulting, with flexible mine planning and phased investment optionality.\n\u00b7\nSust\nainability Integration\n: ESG-aligned design including renewable energy, domestic energy security, and low-emission HELE power.\n\u00b7\nStrategic Timing\n: Positioned to meet rising coal-fired power demand in Bangladesh, where 8,000+ MW of capacity is installed or com\ning online, requiring up to 19 million tonnes of Phulbari-quality coal annually.\nAlignment with Bangladesh's Vision 2041\nThe Project directly supports Bangladesh's national development plan-Vision 2041-which targets graduation from LDC to developing country status by 2026, upper-middle-income status by 2031, and developed nation status by 2041. Central to this ambition is en\nergy security and affordability. GCM's Project aligns with these goals by supplying reliable domestic coal, offsetting imports, enabling industrial growth, and integrating renewable power.\nProgress Aligned with Strategic Objectives\nDuring FY2025, GCM continued to pursue its core strategic objective: securing government approval to advance the Phulbari Coal and Power Project-a large-scale open-pit coal mine capable of producing over 15 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) yielding high-qua\nlity thermal coal and semi-soft coking coal saleable products. Once operational, the Project could supply approximately 60% of the coal required by Bangladesh's existing 8,000MW fleet of high-efficiency, low-emission (HELE) coal-fired power plants.\nHowever\n, progress during the period was materially affected by the significant political disruption that began in mid-2024. Widespread student-led protests in July-August led to the dissolution of the Awami League government, the departure of Prime Minister Sheik\nh Hasina, and the establishment of an Interim Government. The Interim Government was tasked with restoring stability, implementing reforms, and preparing for national elections now scheduled for February 2026.\nThis transitional political environment, coupl\ned with continued bureaucratic reshuffling, introduced delays to the Company's engagement with government officials, including the Bureau of Mineral Development (BMD)-the authority responsible for approving the Project's Feasibility Study and Scheme of Dev\nelopment. Nonetheless, GCM's Dhaka-based team maintained proactive dialogue with contacts within the Power and Energy Ministry, ensuring the Project's strategic importance remained visible to policymakers throughout this uncertain period.\nOf note, momentum\nwas regained in February 2025 with the government-hosted Coal Development Forum, chaired by the Energy Secretary with the Energy Adviser being Chief Guest, and attended by over 80 participants-including government officials, academics, civil society repre\nsentatives, and media. The Forum marked a pivotal moment, with the Phulbari Project acknowledged as Bangladesh's most advanced and immediately implementable domestic coal initiative. Crucially, concluding remarks from the Forum confirmed its aim to lay the\ngroundwork for the\nincoming elected government\nto act on domestic coal extraction.\nDespite the subdued business environment, GCM used this period to significantly strengthen its Project economics. Working with SLR Consulting, the Company completed a compr\nehensive update of the Project's Economic Model. This included revisions to capital and operating cost assumptions, revenue modelling, and the integration of flexible scenarios covering mining methods (contract vs. owner-operated), coal product mix, delive\nry points (mine gate, rail, or port), and coal handling infrastructure.\nThe updated model demonstrates robust financial metrics: using a conservative coal price forecast (factoring the higher energy content of Phulbari coal relative to benchmark Hunter Val\nley coal), the Project is expected to deliver a project IRR of 20-30%, positioning it competitively among large-scale open-pit mining projects both regionally and globally. The model also suggests the Project's potential to generate over US$8 billion in ta\nxes and royalties for the Government of Bangladesh over its 35-year life.\nIn parallel, the Directors believe that macroeconomic signals are becoming increasingly favourable. Global coal markets are facing future supply constraints, with many high-output mi\nnes maturing and limited new capacity forecast to come online before the mid-2030s. This could lead to upward pressure on coal prices, supporting long-term revenue potential for Phulbari. Additionally, the evolving U.S. energy strategy-boosting fossil-fuel\n-backed power infrastructure to meet rising AI and data centre energy demands-is already influencing policy shifts across Asia. This may reduce regulatory resistance to coal and align with Bangladesh's urgent need for domestic energy solutions.\nThese trends strengthen the strategic case for Phulbari as Bangladesh seeks to lower its exposure to the volatility of imported coal and enhance its energy sovereignty. The Project remains uniquely positioned to meet these national objectives with bankable\nscale, economic resilience, and policy alignment.\nYear in review\nFY2025 was marked by heightened political and economic disruption in Bangladesh. Student-led protests in mid-2024 resulted in the collapse of the long-standing Awami League government and th\ne appointment of an Interim Government tasked with restoring order and delivering democratic elections, now scheduled for February 2026.\nAmid this uncertainty, several key developments reinforced momentum behind GCM's Phulbari Coal and Power Project:\n\u00b7\n27 February 2025 - Coal Development Forum\n:\nThe Interim Government convened a landmark forum on coal development, chaired by the Energy Secretary. The event brought together stakeholders from government, academia, civil society, and media. A consensus emerg\ned that Bangladesh must utilise its domestic coal resources to ensure affordable, reliable, and secure energy. The Phulbari Project was identified as the most advanced and near-term viable solution.\n\u00b7\n8 May 2025 - Private Sector Policy Shift\n:\nThe Bangladesh\nPower Development Board (BPDB) published a new policy framework encouraging private investment in power generation. Notably, it:\no\nGrants\nmerchant power plants\nfirst rights to develop a supporting coal mine.\no\nPermits direct power sales to customers beyond tra\nditional PPA structures.\no\nSignals support for surplus coal sales to other plants, reducing reliance on imported coal.\no\nEncourages foreign investment without requiring a local partner.\n\u00b7\n27 August 2025 - BIDA Endorsement\n:\nThe Bangladesh Investment Development A\nuthority (BIDA) issued a press release highlighting energy diversification-including local coal-as a national priority. The Energy Adviser confirmed that policy guidance is being drafted to enable the next elected government to act on coal extraction.\n\u00b7\nExpe\ncted December 2025 - Integrated Master Plan Update\n:\nA revised national energy roadmap is expected by year-end, reinforcing the need for energy security through diversified sources, including coal, gas, solar, and nuclear.\nCorporate and Operational Mileston\nes\n\u00b7\n15 November 2024\n- Allenby Capital Limited appointed as Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker, following the resignation of Zeus Capital.\n\u00b7\n26 November 2024\n- Gary Lye stepped down from the Board to focus on operational oversight in Bangladesh as COO and CEO of Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Ltd.\n\u00b7\n13 December 2024\n- PowerChina extended its Memorandum of Understanding with GCM for another 12 months, r\neaffirming commitment to the Phulbari Project.\n\u00b7\n8 January 2025\n- New consulting agreement signed with Dyani Corporation Ltd. to support strategic engagement with PowerChina and facilitate project financing and approval.\n\u00b7\n28 January 2025\n- Agreement with DG I\nnfratech Pte signed to assist in securing formal government consent for the Project's development.\n\u00b7\n28 March 2025\n- Successfully raised approximately \u00a31.0 million (before expenses) via a share placement, for general working capital purposes.\n\u00b7\n26 June 2025\n-\nCompany became aware of Polo Resources Ltd (a BVI entity) being dissolved and noted that steps are being taken to restore its registered status.\nLooking Ahead\nWhile the past year presented challenges, GCM has maintained strategic momentum, strengthened project fundamentals, and deepened government and stakeholder engagement. With national elections now in sight, the Company remains focused on securing the necess\nary government approvals and advancing the Project toward development readiness.\nThe Phulbari Project remains Bangladesh's most advanced domestic coal initiative-with scale, infrastructure alignment, and strong economic returns. As the country approaches a\ndemocratic reset in 2026, GCM is well positioned to support Bangladesh's urgent need for energy security, industrial growth, and economic resilience.\nFinance review\nThe Group recorded a loss of \u00a32,149,000 during the year ended 30 June 2025 compared to a loss of \u00a31,388,000 during the previous year. The loss increased from the comparative year principally due to the renewal of consultant contracts and one off fees paid\nthereto, from \u00a390,000 in 2024 to \u00a3850,000 this year, but their continuing partnership allows the Group to continue its progress in-line with GCM's strategy of developing power generation as a new business stream, with no slow-down in pursuing and continuin\ng with the Project.\nThe Group recorded a net decrease in cash at the end of the year to \u00a31,310,000 (2024: \u00a31,658,000 increase). Net cash used in operations for the year was \u00a3751,000 (2024: \u00a3763,000), cash used in investing activities was \u00a3521,000 (2024: \u00a3\n444,000), and cash inflow from financing was \u00a3924,000 (2024: \u00a32,322,000).\nThe Group has continued its aim to maintain tight control of expenditure incurred during the year, world economic and inflationary factors contributed to the administrative expenses\nincreasing by 4.9% to \u00a3847,000 for the year ended 30 June 2025 (2024: \u00a3807,000) which included \u00a310,000 non-cash expenditure, and finance costs increased to \u00a3541,000 (2024: \u00a3494,000), in accordance with interest rate change to the Polo Loan Facility. Capi\ntalised expenditure in relation to the mine proposal was \u00a3516,000 for the year ended 30 June 2025 compared to \u00a3443,000 in the previous year.\nTo finance its operations during the year, GCM completed a successful Placing raising Gross proceeds of \u00a31,000,0\n00 in March 2025 with Allenby Capital Ltd. In regard to the short-term loan facility with Polo Resources Limited (\"Polo\") (the \"Polo Loan Facility\"), of the full facility of \u00a33,500,000, \u00a33,200,000 has currently been utilised, however the facility is not cu\nrrently available, and no repayments can be requested whilst Polo remains a dissolved company, as detailed in the RNS of 26 June 2025. The terms of the loan facility were amended in March 2022 as part of the completed placing and subscriptions, such that\nthe lender may request conversion by the issuance of new ordinary shares in the Company at 5.14 pence per share (being the Issue Price) subject to any necessary regulatory approvals. All other terms of the agreement remained unchanged. (See Note 12 for de\ntailed terms).\nAs GCM does not yet generate any revenue, the Board expects that the Group's operations will continue to be funded by a combination of equity and debt financing.\nContinuing for the foreseeable future, the Company's cash expenditure is not expected to increase and, as far as possible, obligations to key stakeholders will be primarily satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"Ordin\nary Shares\"), to both incentivise those stakeholders and preserve cash.\nAs at the date of this report, the Company currently has approximately \u00a3922,000 in available cash resources, which is sufficient to meet the Company's immediate cash requirements unt\nil June/July 2026, assuming the Company's currently forecast cash costs. The Company will further explore additional funding during the next six months.\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\nAt GCM, our commitment to responsible development of the Phulb\nari Coal Project remains unwavering. While we await formal government approval to proceed-expected following national elections in February 2026-our focus on community readiness, environmental stewardship, and global best practice continues.\nWe view CSR no\nt as a box-ticking exercise, but as a long-term commitment to the people and environment of Phulbari. Building and maintaining a Social License to Operate (SLO) means active, ongoing engagement-not just before the first shovel hits the ground, but across t\nhe full life of the Project.\nWorld-Class Standards, Locally Rooted\nGCM is fully aligned with internationally recognised environmental and social frameworks, including:\n\u00b7\nIFC Performance Standards (World Bank Group)\n\u00b7\nThe Equator Principles\n\u00b7\nADB Safeguard Policies\n\u00b7\nNational laws and regulatory frameworks of Bangladesh\nAs a signatory of the UN Global Compact, we are committed to upholding its ten universal principles in human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption.\nEngagement, Inclusio\nn, and Upliftment\nGCM's approach puts local communities at the heart of the Project. Our Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)-based on extensive field surveys and updated demographic data-ensures that those affected by development are not just relocated, but supported to thrive.\nKey commitments under the RAP include:\n\u00b7\nFair and transparent resettlement with full compensation\n\u00b7\nImproved housing and local infrastructure\n\u00b7\nLivelihood restoration grants and skills training\n\u00b7\nPrioritised employment for local residents\n\u00b7\nSupport for agriculture a\nnd land-based livelihoods\nCommunity Presence, Continuous Dialogue\nWe maintain a dedicated, full-time presence within the Project Area, led by a locally grounded team and supported by 72 Community Liaison Assistants (CLAs) drawn directly from the community. This ensures we remain in close touch with local concerns, feedba\nck, and aspirations-building trust and laying the foundation for a successful and inclusive development once final approval is secured.\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe predominant risks and uncertainties faced by the Company are set out below:\nPolitical and Economic Risks:\nThe political landscape has become dominated by the fall of the past Awami League government of former Prime Minister Shaikh Hasina on 5 August 2024 and the appointment of an Interim Government, on 8 August 2024. The Interim\nGovernment consists of Chief Adviser Dr Yunus (Nobel Laureate) and 24 Advisers covering key ministries. The student led protests that caused the government to fall had mobilised enormous support for eliminating corruption and undertaking political and econ\nomic reforms and this has become the Interim Government's mandate.\nThe Interim Government has made notable progress on its July National Charter reform agenda, aimed at overhauling key institutions and preparing for a democratic transition. Six reform com\nmissions submitted their reports by January 2025, covering areas such as constitutional reform, judicial independence, anti-corruption, and electoral systems. A National Consensus Commission (NCC) was formed to engage political parties and build support fo\nr the proposed reforms. By October 2025, a finalised Charter-outlining over 80 structural reforms-was formally shared with all major parties for endorsement, marking a significant milestone in the roadmap toward elections scheduled for early 2026.\nHowever, the reform process remains a work in progress. While broad agreement has been reached on the principles, the Charter does not yet include a clear legal framework or implementation timeline. Some student-led and civil society groups have expressed\nscepticism, urging stronger guarantees and immediate action. The Interim Government has committed to initiating selected reforms, but major constitutional changes are expected to be taken up by the next elected government. For investors, this period presen\nts both opportunity and uncertainty: although institutional reform could improve governance and regulatory clarity, the pace and durability of these changes will depend heavily on the outcome of the February 2026 elections and the political consensus that\nfollows.\nIn short, the success of the February 2026 election will require actions to achieve inclusiveness, institution building, and reform delivery. For investors and project developers, the environment is improving but significant execution and politic\nal risks linger ahead of what is intended to be a landmark transition.\nStrategic Risk:\nThere remains a risk that the strategic partnership with the Chinese state-owned enterprise, PowerChina, may not proceed, which would impact the Company's plan to posi\ntion the Project as a secure, captive coal mine with dependable market outlets for its full production. This could threaten the economic viability of the mine. However, the signing of the Mine Construction and Overburden Stripping EPC contract with PowerCh\nina in March 2024 and on-going communications suggest the risk of PowerChina not being involved with the Project is low.\nAdditionally, the Company continues its communication efforts with key personnel with the aim to ensure the benefits of moving quickl\ny to develop the Phulbari Coal and Power Project are well understood.\nFinancing Risk:\nThere remains a risk that the Company may face challenges in raising the necessary working capital to sustain operations before submitting the Project Proposal to the g\novernment, as well as the additional funds required to guide the Project through government approvals and into the implementation stage. The first financing risk is mitigated by the Company's on-going strong track record of successfully raising capital thr\nough equity markets. The second financing risk is addressed through existing agreements with our Development Partner, PowerChina, who has expressed a willingness to support project financing in exchange for being awarded EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and\nConstruction) contracts. The signing of the US$1 billion Mine Construction and Overburden Stripping EPC contract with PowerChina in March 2024 is a demonstration of the commitment of both companies to move the Project forward.\nIn addition, the move by the\nUS to change its energy and power policies to promote expansion of fossil fuel-based power generation is likely to also remove headwinds for financing and developing new fossil fuel projects, including coal, in Asia.\nAdditionally, the Polo Loan facility\ncan begin to be called in Cash repayments from March 2026 as per the terms of the agreement. However, whilst Polo Resources remains dissolved, no repayments can be requested. Should Polo Resources successfully be reinstated in the BVI, and any repayments r\nequested, the Company would have to secure necessary funding to meet such obligations.\nThe Directors remain confident that the Company will secure the necessary funds when needed. For further details, refer to the Directors' Report.\nCommercial Risk:\nThe primary commercial risk for the Project in Bangladesh stems from potential adverse movements in coal prices and associated cost factors. However, the ongoing global energy supply uncertainty, with increased coal and LNG prices has positively shifted th\ne Project's viability outlook. Bangladesh is dependent on importing most of its energy and with a depreciated local currency, high inflation, diminished foreign exchange reserves and a shortage of US dollars, the country cannot afford to continue with its\n'import all' strategy. The Interim Government recognises this and has taken initiatives to prepare a newly elected government to move on domestic coal development to largely remove the dependence on imported coal. Their stated aim is to reduce costs and im\nprove reliability of supply.\nBangladesh is impacted by Climate Change and continues to push the developed countries to fund preparedness measures. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's role in global emissions remains small and it maintains a 'business as usual' approach to energy and power as it c\nonfronts expanding its energy sector to support economic growth while also adapting to the global shift towards greener energy. The Interim Government has stated that Bangladesh must pursue a strategic energy diversification (including coal). The recent sh\nift in US policies to promote fossil fuels for power generation will take some pressure off Bangladesh as it moves to develop its domestic coal resources to supply its 8000 MW coal-fired power generation.\nBoard engagement with stakeholders\nThis section ser\nves as our section 172 statement and should be read in conjunction with the rest of the Strategic Report and the Company's Corporate Governance Statement.\nSection 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a Director of a company to act in the way he or she co\nnsiders, in good faith, and would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. In doing this, section 172 requires a Director to have regard, among other matters, to: the likely consequences of any decisio\nn in the long term; the interests of the company's employees; the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, governments, local communities, and others; the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment; t\nhe desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and the need to act fairly with members of the company.\nThe Directors uses its Board meetings as a mechanism for giving careful consideration to the factors set out above in discharging their duties under section 172.\nStakeholder engagement\nKey stakeholder groups we engage with are listed below, together with a\nn explanation of why we focus on them and how we engage them.\nEmployees\nThe success of the Group is dependent upon the hard work and dedication of all our employees. The Board ensures a continuing investment in existing employees who are supported through\nprofessional, technical and on-the-job training relevant to their functional areas, as well as other relevant role-specific training. The Board directs executives and senior managers to keep staff informed of the progress and development of the Company on\na regular basis through formal and informal meetings and regular communications. In addition, the Board ensures funds are provided for regular events to encourage employee participation in local community initiatives.\nGovernment Agencies &\nLocal Communities\nThe Group operates in the regulated mining sector in Bangladesh. The Board ensures the Company adopts a positive focus on maintaining productive relations with local communities and all levels of government. As a result, the Chief Execut\nive Officer and Chief Operating Officer regularly conduct consultations with multi-levels of government agencies to ensure that all regulatory approvals and permits remain in good order. Development of local community improvement programmes are undertaken\nwith consultation of local government and community representatives to maintain positive and productive relationships necessary to advance the Phulbari project.\nAs a mining exploration Group, the Board takes seriously its ethical responsibilities to the c\nommunities and environment in which it works. Wherever possible, local communities are engaged in the geological operations and support functions required for field operations. The regions in which the Group operates have native title laws. The Company is\nrespectful of native title rights and engages proactively with local communities. In addition, we are careful to manage the environmental obligations of our work, and undertake site rehabilitation programmes, and prepare mine management plans, in accordanc\ne with local laws and regulations. Our goal is to meet or exceed standards, to ensure we maintain our social licence to operate from the communities with which we interact.\nContractors & Suppliers\nOur proposed Joint Venture associates, consultants and supp\nliers are key business partners, and the quality of goods and services we receive are essential to supporting operations and to enhance the project process with our goal to successfully submit our project proposal to the Bangladesh Government for approval.\nDuring the year, the Board committed significant resources into fostering improved relationships with our key partners. As directed by the Board, management collaborates and continually works with our partners and the full supply chain, sharing best pract\nice and seeking out synergies to improve.\nLender\nOn 26 June 2025, the Company announced the Company had become aware that Polo Resources Ltd, a British Virgin Islands (\"BVI\") incorporated company, was dissolved on 5 September 2023 as the result of the resi\ngnation of its BVI agent. The Company has been informed that the officers of Polo are currently undertaking steps to restore its status as a registered company in the BVI including the appointment of a new BVI agent. This is expected to occur following, in\nter alia, the satisfactory completion of customary due diligence on Polo and its stakeholders by the new BVI agent, followed by a court order as required under the laws of the BVI. Notwithstanding this, there can be no certainty that Polo will be restored\nas a registered company in the BVI, nor as to the timing of any such restoration. As most recently announced on 31 March 2025, Polo has provided a \u00a33.5 million loan facility to the Company of which as at 31 December 2024, \u00a3300,000 remained undrawn. In ligh\nt of this, the board of directors of GCM believes that the status of the Company's indebtedness to Polo is uncertain but given the expectation that the officers of Polo will restore Polo as a registered company in the BVI, the board is currently treating t\nhe loan which\n, at 30 June 2025 amounted to \u00a36,198,000 (31 December 2024: \u00a35,923,000) including loan interest, as unaffected\n.\nInvestors\nInvestors are considered key stakeholders, and consequently investor relations are a focus area for Directors. Where poss\nible the Board engages investors on Group performance following project updates and results announcements with face-to-face meetings or scheduled calls.\nOn behalf of the Board,\nDatuk Michael Tang PJN\nChief Executive Officer\n21 November 2025\nCorporate Governance Report\nCorporate Governance Statement\nIn November 2023 the Quoted Companies Alliance ('QCA') updated its Corporate Governance Code dated April 2018 (the 'QCA Code 2018'). The QCA's Corporate Governance Code 2023 (the 'QCA Code 2023')\ncame into effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 01 April 2024.\nThe QCA Code 2018 and the QCA Code 2023 each take key elements of good governance and apply them in manners which are workable for the different needs of growing companies. The QCA Code 2018 and the QCA Code 2023 are each constructed around ten broad princ\niples and sets of disclosures.\nGCM Resources Plc's ('GCM' or 'the Company') directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance, and in 2018 the Company adopted the QCA Code 2018 and applied its ten principles. On 26 June 2025 the Company ado\npted the QCA Code 2023 with immediate effect and has applied its ten principles, except as specifically noted below. The Company's compliance with the QCA Code 2023 is as described below which sets out the manner of compliance with the QCA Code 2023 or sta\ntes that the manner of compliance is described in the information provided on the Company's website at www.gcmplc.com.\nCorporate Governance Statement\nAs an independent non-executive director and chair (the 'Chair') of the board of directors of the Company (the 'Board' or the 'Board of Directors') it is my responsibility to ensure that the Company correctly implements and applies the ten principles of th\ne QCA Code 2023 to support the Company in achieving its priority goal of obtaining approval for the development of\nthe Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west\nBangladesh\n.\nThe Board believes that it applies the ten principles of the\nQCA Code 2023 but recognises the need to continue to review and develop governance practises and structures, to ensure they are in line with the growth and strategic plan of the Company.\nThe key governance related matter to have occurred during 2025 is th\ne Company's decision to adopt the QCA's updated Corporate Governance Code, the QCA Code 2023, and apply its ten principles.\nThe Principles of the QCA Code 2023\nPrinciple 1: Establish a purpose, strategy and business model which promote long-term value for\nshareholders\nGCM has established a strategy and business model, the purpose of which is to promote long-term value for shareholders. The strategy and business\nmodel provides as follows:\n\u00b7\nthe principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the 'Group') is the development of the identified world class coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (\"the Project\") in north-wes\nt Bangladesh. Utilising the latest highly energy efficient coal-power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW. The Project site can also support over 2,000MW of Solar Power capacity throughout the Project life span. GCM requir\nes approval from the Government of Bangladesh to develop the Project.\n\u00b7\nthe strategy of the Company is obtaining approval from the Bangladesh Government for the comprehensive Project Proposal. With our Development Partner, PowerChina, GCM aims to finance, develop, and operate all project aspects over a 35+ year lifespan.\nThe\nbusiness and operations of the Group are subject to a number of risk factors. These risk factors and the Group's comments and mitigating actions against them are set out in the 'Strategic Report - Risks and Uncertainties' section of the Annual Report(s).\nThe strategy and business model demonstrate that the delivery of long-term growth is underpinned by a clear set of values aimed at protecting the Company from unnecessary risk and securing its medium to long-term future, and to deliver shareholder value i\nn the medium to long-term.\nPrinciple 2: Promote a corporate culture that is based on ethical values and behaviours\nThe Board promotes a corporate culture that is based on ethical values and behaviours. The Board considers it an asset and source of competi\ntive advantage to undertake its business and operations in an ethical manner. As such the Company has adopted a number of policies (including but not limited to the following):\n\u00b7\nCode of Conduct: This includes matters such as: compliance with law; disclosure of information; accounting records and practises; fair dealing; conflicts of interest; corporate opportunities; use of company property; safety and environmental protection; fu\nndamental rights; responsibility; where to seek clarification; and reporting breaches;\n\u00b7\nAnti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy: The government of the United Kingdom ('UK') has issued guidelines setting out appropriate procedures for companies to follow to\nensure that they are compliant with the UK Bribery Act 2010. The Company has conducted a review into its operational procedures to consider the impact of the Bribery Act 2010 and the Board has adopted an anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy;\n\u00b7\nShare Dea\nling Code: The Company has adopted a share dealing code for dealings in securities of the Company by directors and certain employees which is appropriate for a company whose shares are traded on AIM. The share dealing code is based on the model code develo\nped by the QCA and the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. This constitutes the Company's share dealing policy for the purpose of compliance with UK legislation including the Market Abuse Regulation and the relevant part of the AIM Rules\nfor Companies. Furthermore, insider legislation set out in the UK Criminal Justice Act 1993, as well as the provisions relating the market abuse, apply to the Company and dealings in its ordinary shares; and\n\u00b7\nSocial Media Policy: The Board has adopted a social media policy which is designed to minimise the risks to the Company's business arising from, and to assist directors and employees in making appropriate decisions about, the use of social media. In partic\nular, the policy provides guidance that the disclosure on social media of commercially sensitive, price sensitive, private or confidential information relating to the Company is prohibited.\nThe policy set by the Board is evidenced by the actions and decis\nions of the chief executive officer and the rest of the management team. Our corporate values guide the objectives and strategy of the Company and drive the strategy and business model adopted by the Board.\nThe culture is visible in every aspect of the bu\nsiness, including recruitments, nominations, training and engagement. The Company's performance and reward systems endorse the desired ethical behaviours across all levels of the Company.\nPrinciple 3: Seek to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations\nThe Board seeks to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations by discussing the overall development of the Company's strategy regularly at meetings of the Board. This\nissue will be a standing point of business at each Board meeting. The Board will also seek to develop a good understanding of the needs and expectations of all elements of the Company's shareholder base by asking the Company's registrar to keep the directo\nrs informed of the change in identity of any significant shareholders.\nThe Board will work alongside its Nominated Adviser and other advisers to manage shareholders' expectations in order to seek to understand the motivations behind shareholder voting dec\nisions. The Board will take into account shareholder voting at any general meeting and any correspondence received by the Company from shareholders with respect to any matter relating to its business to further its understanding. Shareholders are encourage\nd to contact the Company - this can readily be done by email submission to info@gcmplc.com.\nPrinciple 4: Take into account wider stakeholder interests, including social and environmental responsibilities, and their implications for long-term success\nThe Board understands that the Company's long-term success relies upon good relations with a range of different stakeholder groups, both its internal workforce and its external suppliers, customers, regulators and others.\nGCM has identified the following\ninternal stakeholders:\n\u00b7\nshareholder and loan note holders;\n\u00b7\nthe directors of the Company; and\n\u00b7\nall members of the Company's and Subsidiaries' management teams (in compliance, administrative and field-based roles).\nGCM has identified the following external stakeholders:\n\u00b7\nsuppliers of goods and equipment;\n\u00b7\nsecurities regulators;\n\u00b7\nlocal government (Bangladesh);\n\u00b7\nministerial departments responsible for administering mineral & resources exploration activities to take pla\nce; and\n\u00b7\nlocal communities.\nThe Company will take into account wider stakeholder interests, including social and environmental responsibilities, and their implications for long-term success.\nGiven the business and operations of the Company, matters may a\nrise that impact on society and the communities within which it operates or the environments which may have the potential to affect the Company's ability to deliver shareholder value over the medium to long-term.\nFeedback from government agencies reflects the importance of making local communities active stakeholders who are incentivised to support the Project. This includes offering employment, access to education, and fair compensation for land and relocation nee\nds. In response, GCM's Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was developed as part of the comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for the coal mine, and reflects the specific requirements identified through extensive community surveys within and\nadjacent to the Project Area. A demographic survey conducted in 2019 further updated population and household data to guide our approach.\nThrough the RAP, GCM is committed to uplifting the local community and will ensure the following:\n\u2022 Fair, transparen\nt, and fully compensated relocation;\n\u2022 Enhanced living standards with improved town and village amenities;\n\u2022 Financial grants to improve livelihoods;\n\u2022 Training programs and preferential employment opportunities;\n\u2022 Support for agricultural development\nto bolster local farming.\nPrinciple 5: Embed effective risk management, internal controls and assurance activities, considering both opportunities and threats, throughout the organisation\nAs described above, the Company's business and operations are subje\nct to certain risks. The Board receives monthly updates from management on operational, investor and public relations, finance and administrative matters. In addition, the Company's directors are encouraged to liaise and meet with management on a regular b\nasis to discuss matters of particular interest to each director. The Company's management has implemented effective risk management, considering both opportunities and threats, throughout the organisation.\nThe Board shall ensure that the Company's risk management framework, including internal controls and assurance activities, identifies and addresses all relevant risks in order to execute and deliver its strategy. The Company has considered its extended bus\niness, from key suppliers to end-customers in identifying and addressing risk. As the Company grows then the risk management framework, including internal controls and assurance activities, will develop accordingly.\nThe Board has developed a strategy to d\netermine the extent of exposure to the identified risks that the Company is able to bear and willing to take.\nPrinciple 6: Establish and maintain the board as a well-functioning, balanced team led by the chair\nAs a Board the directors have collective responsibility and legal obligation to promote the interests of the Company and are collectively responsible for defining corporate governance arrangements. Ultimate responsibility for the quality of, and approach t\no, corporate governance lies with the Board. The Company holds Board meetings at least six times each complete financial year, and at other times as and when required.\nThe Board currently comprises four directors (see below), two of whom are deemed to be i\nndependent non-executive directors for the purpose of corporate governance (being Charlie Green and myself (Paul Shackleton)).\nAs at the date of this statement the Board consists of the following members:\nPaul Shackleton, Non-Executive Director (Independe\nnt) & Chair of the Board of Directors\nMr Shackleton is an experienced London based corporate finance adviser and broker who, since 1996, has specialised in both domestic and international AIM traded companies, including advising companies in the role of N\nominated Adviser.

As noted above, the Company has audit, and remuneration & nominations committees. The Board be\nlieves these committees provide for governance structures and processes in line with its corporate culture and appropriate to its size and complexity; and capacity, appetite and tolerance for risk.\nThese governance structures may evolve over time in paral\nlel with the Company's objectives, strategy, and business model and plan to reflect the development of the Company.\nThe biographical details of the directors are set out above. The biographies demonstrate that collectively the Board has an appropriate bal\nance of sector, financial and public markets skills and experience, as well as an appropriate balance of individual personal qualities and capabilities. The directors understand the need for diversity, including gender balance, as part of its composition a\nnd will keep this under review. Currently the Board, comprising four persons, has two independent non-executive directors, being Charlie Green and myself.\nThe Board understands that as companies evolve, the mix of skills and experience required on the Boa\nrd will change, and Board composition will need to evolve to reflect this change. It is considered that at this stage there is no need to seek additional experience, skills and capabilities on the Board.\nPrinciple 8: Evaluate board performance based on c\nlear and relevant objectives, seeking continuous improvement\nThe Board has adopted a policy to evaluate the Board's performance based on clear and relevant objectives, seeking continuous improvement.

The review will also identify any succession planning issues and put in place processes to provide for succession planning.\nThere has been no notable work of the remuneratio\nn & nominations committee undertaken during 2024/2025.\nPrinciple 9: Establish a remuneration policy which is supportive of long-term value creation and the company's purpose, strategy and culture\nThe Board recognises that the remuneration of directors (both executive and non-executive) and senior management is of legitimate concern to shareholders and is committed to following current best practise. The Group operates within a competitive environme\nnt and its performance depends upon the individual contributions of the directors and senior management.\nThe objective of the Company's remuneration policy is to incentivise long-term growth and shareholder returns. The policy of the Board is to provide r\nemuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain personnel of the calibre necessary to maintain the Group's position, and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value and returns. It aims to provide sufficient levels of remuneration to do th\nis, but to avoid paying more than is necessary. Remuneration packages also reflect levels of responsibilities and contain incentives to deliver the Group's objectives, in line with the Company's purpose, strategy and culture.\nPrinciple 10: Communicate how\nthe company is governed and is performing by maintaining a dialogue with shareholders and other key stakeholders\nThe Company maintains a website at www.gcmplc.com which provides information about the Company's strategy and project information and provide\ns updates on its operations and governance. In addition, the Company maintains a dialogue with shareholders and other key stakeholders by the issue of press releases as required by AIM.\nThe Company has adopted a communication and reporting structure which\nsets out the manner of open communication between the Board and all constituent parts of its shareholder base. From time-to-time the Company will participate in investor focused conferences and forums, and the Company will endeavour to make prior announce\nments of such engagements such that shareholders of the Company may wish to attend themselves and meet with those members of the Board and / or senior management who may be present. All members of the Board and senior management are encouraged to attend th\ne Company's Annual General Meeting and other general meetings when shareholders will be encouraged to ask questions of the Board and the Company's senior management. This structure will assist in:\n\u00b7\nthe communication of shareholders' views to the Board; and\n\u00b7\nthe shareholders' understanding of the unique circumstances and constraints faced by the Company.\nThe 'Remuneration Report' section of the Annual Reports, sets out a number of matters including:\nthe responsibilities and duties, and membership of the remuneration & nominations committee; remuneration of directors (both executive and non-executive) and senior management; policy on remuneration; and notable work of the remuneration & nominations comm\nittee undertaken during the relevant period.\nA separate 'Audit Committee Report' is included in the Annual Report if there are any material matters arising, otherwise on the grounds that there were no material matters arising either during the relevant pe\nriod or subsequently this will be omitted.\nNotable work undertaken during 2024-2025 by other Board committees includes:\n\u00b7\nin September 2024 and November 2024, the audit committee met with the Company's independent auditor in connection with the audit of th\ne consolidated financial statements of GCM for the year ended 30 June 2024, and it was noted that there were no material matters arising.\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to lead a Board and a Company that continues to strive to make improvements in all areas of its activities with a view to ultimately benefiting all of our stakeholders.\nI hope that you embrace our philosophy and approach to con\nducting our business, as we continue to look forward to being able to report back to you on our developments.\nApproved by the Board of Directors and signed on behalf of the Board of Directors on 21 November 2025.\nPaul Shackleton\nNon-Executive Chairman\n21 November 2025\nRemuneration Report\nThe Remuneration Report the year ended 30 June 2025 is below.\nRemuneration & nominations committee\nThe remuneration &\nnominations committee of the board of directors of GCM resources Plc ('GCM' or 'the Company') is responsible for providing recommendations to the board of directors of the Company (the 'Board' or the 'Board of Directors') on matters including the composit\nion of the Board and competencies of directors, the appointment of directors, the performance of the executive directors and senior management, and making recommendations to the Board on matters relating to their remuneration and terms of employment.

Non-cash expenses of \u00a3850,000 were incurred during the year (2024: \u00a390,000).\nCapitalised evaluation expenditure relating to the Phulba\nri Coal and Power Project was \u00a3516,000 for the year ended 30 June 2025 (2024: \u00a3443,000).\nEvents after the end of the reporting period\nThe events which took place subsequent to 30 June 2025, are fully disclosed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2024: nil).\nGoing concern\nAs at 30 June 2025, the Group had \u00a31,310,000 in cash and \u00a36,244,000 of net current liabilities. The directors and management have prepared a cash flow forecast to December 2026, which shows that the Group will require further funds to cover operating costs\nto advance the Phulbari Coal and Power Project and meet its liabilities as and when they fall due. Based on current forecasts, additional funding will need to be either raised from third parties or the short-term loan facility with Polo Resources Limited\n(\"Polo Loan Facility\") increased and extended (if available) by the end of July 2026, in order to meet current operating cost projections. The Directors also note that, under the amended terms of the existing Polo Loan Facility, the lender agreed not to se\nrve a repayment request in cash for 5 years from the date of amended terms, 26 March 2021, or alternatively convert to shares at 5.14 pence per share at the lender's option (as amended on 1 March 2022). The Company does not currently have secured funding a\nrrangements in place to cover this loan or further potential expenditure which may be needed to advance the Project and, accordingly, should Polo request repayment of the Polo Loan Facility (under certain terms of the Loan Facility), GCM will need to raise\nfunds in a short amount of time, which may not be available on terms acceptable to the Board or on a workable timeframe. It also needs to be noted that whilst Polo remains dissolved, the Loan Facility cannot be called in, nor any payments requested.\nThe Company currently has \u00a3922,000 cash at the date of this report, and based on projected future cash expenditure, this is not expected to be sufficient to support the Company's operations for the twelve months from the date of this report. At the current\nrun rates, along with the Company's existing cash resources, this is only expected to provide sufficient capital for the next seven/eight months. The Company intends to explore alternative funding options over the next six months, with the aim to complete\nand secure the necessary third-party funding by the end of May 2026.\nIn forming the conclusion that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis the Directors have made the following assumptions that are relevant to the\nnext twelve months:\n-\nSufficient additional funding can be obtained for working capital purposes; and\n-\nIn the event that operating expenditure increases significantly as a result of successful progress with regards to the Phulbari Coal and Power Project, suf\nficient funding can be obtained.\nWhile the Directors remain confident that necessary funds will be available as and when required, as at the date of this report these funding arrangements are not secured, the above conditions and events represent material\nuncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group's and Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would r\nesult if the Group and Company were unable to continue as a going concern.\nUpon achieving approval of the Phulbari Coal and Power Project, significant additional financial resources will be required to proceed to development.\nFuture outlook\nThe Group is fully committed to the Phulbari Coal and Power Project and is directly engaging with the Government of Bangladesh and other stakeholders to move the Project forward.\nA detailed review of progress on the Phulbari Coal and Power Project is inclu\nded in the Group Strategic Report.\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nDetails of the Group's principal risks and uncertainties\ncan be found within the Group Strategic Report.\nFinancial instruments\nDetails of the financial risk management objectives and p\nolicies of the Group and information on the Group's exposure to financial risks can be found in note 18 to the financial statements.\nDirectors\nThe Directors who served during the year:\nAppointed\nResigned\nExecutive Directors\nDatuk Michael Tang PJN\n-\n-\nKeith Fulton\n-\n-\nGary Lye\n-\n26 November 2024\nNon-Executive Directors\nPaul Shackleton\n22 March 2024\n-\nCharlie Green\n22 March 2024\n-\nInternal controls\nThe Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group's systems of internal controls and for reviewing their effectiveness.

Market sensitive information is always released to all shareholders concurrently in accordance with stock exchange rules. The AGM provides an opportunity for all\nshareholders to communicate with and to question the Board on any aspect of the Group's activities. The Group maintains a corporate website where information on the Group is regularly updated and all announcements are posted.\nWebsite disclosure\nThe Group has a\nwebsite\nwww.gcmplc.com\non which\nstatutory information, press releases and background information on the Group and its operations can be found.\nAnnual General Meeting (AGM)\nFull details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Company's AGM will be included in the Notice of Meeting which will be distributed to shareholders along with the Annual Report.\nAuditors\nThe auditors to the Group, PKF Littlejohn LLP, have expressed th\neir willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution proposing their reappointment will be submitted at the AGM.\nDirectors' statement as to disclosure of information to auditors\nAll of the current Directors have taken all the steps that they\nought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the Company's auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit information\nof which the auditors are unaware.\nStatement of Directors' responsibilities\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and regulations.\nCompany law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have elected\nto prepare Group financial statements under UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of t\nhe Group and Parent Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.\nThe Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on AIM.\nIn prep\naring\nthe financial statements the directors are required to:\n\u00b7\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n\u00b7\nmake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n\u00b7\nstate whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nprepare the\nfinancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent Company will continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and expla\nin the Group's and Parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies\nAct 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nWebsite publication\nThe directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements are published on the Company's website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the prepa\nration and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company's website is the responsibility of the directors. The directors' responsibility also extends to the ong\noing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.\nOn behalf of the Board,\nKeith Fulton\nExecutive Director\n21 November 2025\nIndependent Auditor's Report\nIndependent auditor's report to the members of GCM Resources Plc\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of GCM Resources Plc (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') for the year ended 30 June 2025 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company B\nalance Sheet, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity,\nthe Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies.\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of\nthe parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101\nReduced Disclosure Framework\n(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\nIn our opinion:\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements give a tr\nue and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 30 June 2025 and of the group's loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nthe group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international acc\nounting standards;\n\u00b7\nthe parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Comp\nanies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for th\ne audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Stan\ndard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMater\nial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 1 in both the group and parent company financial statements, which indicates that the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the ability to secure additional funding through financi\nng arrangements or the issue of equity. We also note that the loan from Polo Resources Ltd, amounting to \u00a36,198k as at 30 June 2025, is scheduled for repayment in March 2026. If the loan were to be called upon at that time, the company is not forecasted to\nhave sufficient funds available to meet the repayment obligation. As stated in note 1, these events or conditions, along with the other matters as set forth in note 1, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the gro\nup's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the prepara\ntion of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\u00b7\nChallenging the directors' forecasts prepared to\nassess the group's and parent company's ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements..\n\u00b7\nReviewing the consistency of committed cash flows against contract\nual arrangements and compared general overheads to current run rates.\n\u00b7\nComparing actual results for the year to past budgets to assess the forecasting ability/accuracy of management.\n\u00b7\nVerifying the latest post year end cash position in comparison to budget.\n\u00b7\nReviewing post year end information such as board meeting minutes and Regulatory News Service announcements (RNS's).\n\u00b7\nDiscussions with the directors on the strategies that they are pursuing to secure further funding if and when required.\n\u00b7\nReviewing the ade\nquacy of the disclosures in respect of going concern including the uncertainty over the ability to raise additional funds.\nOur application of materiality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and exten\nt of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we consider 1.5% of total assets (2024: 1.5% of total assets) to be the most significant determinant of the group's financial performance used by shareholders as the group continues to bring its mining assets through to\ndevelopment. Materiality of the parent company was based upon 5% of the loss before tax (2024: 5% of the loss before tax) in order to achieve sufficient coverage of expenditure in our testing.\nWhilst materiality for the financial statements as a whole wa\ns \u00a3685,000 (2024: \u00a3682,000), each significant component of the group was audited to a lower level of materiality. The parent company materiality was \u00a374,000 (2024: \u00a366,000) with the other components being audited to a materiality of \u00a3239,500 (2024: \u00a3238,00\n0). These materiality levels were used to determine the financial statement areas that are included within the scope of our audit work and the extent of sample sizes during the audit.\nPerformance materiality is the application of materiality at the indivi\ndual account or balance level set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. Performance materiality was set at 70% (2024: 70%) of the above mater\niality levels for both group and parent company, equating to \u00a3479,000 (2024: \u00a3477,400) and \u00a374,000 (2024: \u00a346,000) respectively, based upon our assessment of the risk of misstatement.\nWe agreed with management that we would report to the audit committee a\nll individual audit differences identified during the course of our audit in excess of \u00a334,000 (2024: \u00a334,100) for the financial statements as a whole and \u00a35,000 (2024: \u00a33,300) for the parent company. We also agreed to report differences below these thresh\nolds that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\nOur approach to the audit\nOur group audit scope focused on the group's principal operating location being Bangladesh which was subject to a specific scope audit together with the parent co\nmpany, which was also subject to a full scope audit.\nEntities subject to specific and full scope audits account for 99% (2024: 99%) of the total assets.\nThe remaining components of the group were not in scope.\nThe audits of each of the specific and full\nscope components were performed in the United Kingdom. All of the audits were conducted by PKF Littlejohn LLP.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to\nfraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the\nfinancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey Audit Matter\nHow our scope addressed this matter\nCarrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation asset (Group)\nAs disclosed in note 9 to the group financial Statements, the group's intangible asset represents capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure on the Phulbari Coal Project. The balance is \u00a344.3m as at 30 June 2025 (2024: \u00a343.8m).\nThe group ha\ns a contract with the Government of Bangladesh to explore, develop and mine on the Phulbari Coal licence area. In 2005 the Group submitted a feasibility study and mine development plan, in line with the terms of the contract, to obtain approval to move fo\nrward with development. To date the government has not provided the necessary approval. As a result, there is continued uncertainty regarding if such approval will be obtained. The parent company has received a legal opinion confirming that the group ret\nains legal title to the asset despite the delays in approval, and that the contract with the Government of Bangladesh is enforceable under Bangladesh and International law.\nThe directors consider that the delay in obtaining the approval does not represen\nt an indicator of impairment under IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. As part of the impairment assessment the directors concluded that the value of the intangible asset and investment in subsidiary continues to be appropriately su\npported by the original definitive feasibility study submitted in 2005. As such, the carrying value is dependent upon the ultimate approval of the feasibility study and mine development plan. The directors remain satisfied that approval will ultimately be\nobtained and concluded that no impairment is required at 30 June 2025.\nThe directors have disclosed their key judgements, together with the uncertainties in this regard, in note 1 to the financial statements. Given the level of judgement applied, and th\ne ongoing delays in obtaining government approvals, we consider this to be a significant audit risk and a key audit matter.\nOur work included:\n\u00b7\nEvaluating the Directors' assessment of the group's right to tenure over the Phulbari Coal licence area by reviewing historical agreements and the external legal opinion obtained by the group on the status of the overriding contract. We obtained legal opi\nnions from the group's external solicitor and assessed the solicitor's competence and independence to give such opinions. A discussion was held with the lawyer providing those opinions.\n\u00b7\nGaining an understanding of the strategy the directors are pursuing\nto progress the project given the continued delays in securing development approval and reviewing the partnership agreements the parent company has entered into historically and during the period.\n\u00b7\nEvaluating management's assessment of impairment indicato\nrs and underlying economic model against the original feasibility study submitted in 2005, including the approved coal reserves study. We critically challenged the key estimates and assumptions used including their continued appropriateness including asses\nsment of the price inputs to market data and forecasts; re-calculation of discount rates; and review of the forecast costs. We performed our own sensitivity analysis over individual key inputs, together with a combination of sensitivities over such inputs.\n\u00b7\nReviewed the political environment in Bangladesh and to corresponded with entity's legal counsel in regard to their view of political position as part of as part of assessment on carrying value of the asset\n\u00b7\nReviewing the minutes of meeting of GCM's board and RNS announcements for indicators of a potential trigger for impairment.\n\u00b7\nEvaluating the disclosures given in the notes to the financial statements, including the judgments and the uncertainties regarding the ultimate approval by the Government of Bangladesh.\nKey observation:\nWe draw attention to Note 1 in the financial statements, which describes the significant uncertainty related to the issuance of the relevant approval and license by the government of Bangladesh. The entity holds an exploration and evaluation asset valued a\nt \u00a344.3m, the value of which is linked to the receipt of this approval. As of the date of this report, the government has not yet provided the relevant approval, and there is no assurance that it will be granted. Should this approval not be granted, this w\nould indicate that the exploration and evaluation asset may be impaired.\nCarrying value of investment in subsidiaries (Parent Company)\nThe parent company holds an investment in Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Limited which is the entity that holds the underlying Phulbari asset. The value of the investment on the parent company balance sheet is \u00a348.9m (2024: \u00a348.5m), as disclosed\nin note 6 to the parent company financial statements.\nThe recoverability of the investment in Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Limited is reliant on the successful development of the Phulbari asset and is therefore subject to the same uncertaintie\ns regarding recoverability.\nGiven the level of judgement applied, and the ongoing delays in obtaining government approvals, we consider this to be a significant audit risk and a key audit matter.\nOur work included:\n\u00b7\nObtaining evidence of ownership for all investments held within the group;\n\u00b7\nObtaining the impairment review for all investments held from management and corroborating the assumptions made to third party evidence; and\n\u00b7\nReviewing the value of the net investment in subsidiaries against the underlying assets and verifying and corroborating the judgements/estimates used by management to assess the recoverability of investments.\nKey observation:\nWe note that carrying value of the investment is inherently linked to the Phulbari asset amounting to \u00a344.3m, and any impairment on the asset would also give rise to an impairment in the value of the investment.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on\nthe group and parent company financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other\ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such materia\nl inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material miss\ntatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u00b7\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u00b7\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepa\nred in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing\nto report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not bee\nn received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received\nall the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group and parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal\ncontrol as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are r\nesponsible for assessing the group and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate\nthe group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial sta\ntements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordanc\ne with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions\nof users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatement\ns in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained an understanding of the group and parent company and the sector in which they operat\ne to identify laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the financial statements. We obtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with management and our experience of the resource exploration sector\n.\n\u00b7\nWe determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to the group and parent company in this regard to be those arising from\no\nCompanies Act 2006;\no\nAIM listing rules\no\nQuoted Companies Alliance Code; and\no\nLocal laws and regulations in Bangladesh where the group operates.\n\u00b7\nWe designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit team considered whether there were any indications of non-compliance by the group and parent company with those laws and regulations. Th\nese procedures included, but were not limited to:\no\nEnquiries of management\no\nReview of Board minutes\no\nReview of legal expenses including inquiry of the group's legal representative\no\nReview of RNS announcements\n\u00b7\nWe also identified the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. We considered, in addition to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of controls, that the estimates, judgements and\nassumptions applied by management in the assessment of impairment of intangible assets, valuation of investments have the greatest potential for management bias. Refer to the Key audit matter section above.\n\u00b7\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risk o\nf fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit procedures which included, but were not limited to: the testing of journals; reviewing accounting estimates for evidence of bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any signific\nant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial st\natements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of n\non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities\n.

Accounting policies\nGCM Resources plc is domiciled in England and Wales, was incorporated in England and Wales as a Public Limited Company on 26 September 2003 and admitted to the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\") on 19 April 2004.\nThe financial rep\nort was authorised for issue by the Directors on 21 November 2025, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet was signed on the Board's behalf by Keith Fulton.\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in prep\naring the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2025.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise stated.\nThe functional and presentational currency of each of the entities in t\nhe Group is pounds sterling, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (\u00a3000) except where otherwise indicated.\nPolitical and economic risks - carrying value of intangible asset\nThe principal asset is in Bangladesh and accordingly subject to the political, judicial, fiscal, social and economic risks associated with operating in that country.\nThe Group's principal project relates to thermal coal and semi-soft coking coal, the markets for which are subject to international and regional supply and demand factors, and consequently future performance will be subject to variations in the prices for\nthese products.\nGCM, through its subsidiaries, is party to a Contract with the Government of Bangladesh which gives it the right to explore, develop and mine in respect of the licence areas. The Group holds a mining lease and exploration licences in the P\nhulbari area covering the prospective mine site.\nThe mining lease has a 30-year term from 2004 and may be renewed for further periods of 10 years each, at GCM's option.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Contract, GCM submitted a combined Feasibility Stu\ndy and Scheme of Development report on 2 October 2005 to the Government of Bangladesh. Approval of the Scheme of Development from the Government of Bangladesh is necessary to proceed with development of the mine. GCM continues to await approval.\nThe Gro\nup has received no notification from the Government of Bangladesh (the \"Government\") of any changes to the terms of the Contract.\nGCM has received legal opinion that the Contract is enforceable under Bangladesh and International law, and will consequently\ncontinue to endeavour to receive approval for development.\nAccordingly, the Directors believe that the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") will ultimately receive approval, although the timing of approval remains in the hands of the Governme\nnt. To enhance the prospects of the Project, GCM has engaged in a strategy to align the Project with the needs and objectives of the Government. This includes the option to supply coal to both privately owned and the Government's own commissioned and in th\ne pipeline power plants, which currently totals 8,175MW. The Government is seeking to grow its economy and deliver electricity at prices that will ensure competitiveness of its industries. The Group's strategy of developing the Phulbari coal deposit as a c\naptive, large-scale, open pit mining operation supporting some 6,600MW of highly energy-efficient Ultra-Supercritical power generation will enable cheaper coal-fired electricity than imported coal options. This evolving strategy has been enhanced to includ\ne installation of a large-scale Solar Power Park (up to 2,000MW) within the Project area, to be installed within the first two years of gaining land access; operating the Phulbari coal mine as a \"Net Zero Carbon\" or \"Green Mine\"; and participation modaliti\nes for Government.\nUntil approval of the Scheme of Development from the Government of Bangladesh is received there is continued uncertainty over the recoverability of the intangible mining assets. The Directors consider that it is appropriate to conti\nnue to record the intangible mining assets at cost, however if for whatever reason the Scheme of Development is not ultimately approved the Group would impair all of its intangible mining assets, totalling \u00a344,326,000 as at 30 June 2025.\nGoing concern\nAs at 30 June 2025, the Group had \u00a31,310,000 in cash and \u00a36,244,000 of net current liabilities. The directors and management have prepared a cash flow forecast to December 2026, which shows that the Group will require further funds to cover operating costs\nto advance the Phulbari Coal and Power Project and meet its liabilities as and when they fall due. Based on current forecasts, additional funding will need to be either raised from third parties or the short-term loan facility with Polo Resources Limited\n(\"Polo Loan Facility\") increased and extended (if available) by the end of July 2026, in order to meet current operating cost projections. The Directors also note that, under the amended terms of the existing Polo Loan Facility, the lender agreed not to se\nrve a repayment request in cash for 5 years from the date of amended terms, 26 March 2021, or alternatively convert to shares at 5.14 pence per share at the lender's option (as amended on 1 March 2022). The Company does not currently have secured funding a\nrrangements in place to cover this loan or further potential expenditure which may be needed to advance the Project and, accordingly, should Polo request repayment of the Polo Loan Facility (under certain terms of the Loan Facility), GCM will need to raise\nfunds in a short amount of time, which may not be available on terms acceptable to the Board or on a workable timeframe. It also needs to be noted that whilst Polo remains dissolved, the Loan Facility cannot be called in, nor any payments requested.\nThe\nGroup currently has \u00a3922,000 cash at the date of this report, and based on projected future cash expenditure, this is not expected to be sufficient to support the Company's operations for the twelve months from the date of this report. At the current run\nrates, along with the Company's existing cash resources, this is only expected to provide sufficient capital for the next seven/eight months. The Company intends to explore alternative funding options over the next six months, with the aim to complete and\nsecure the necessary third-party funding by the end of May 2026\nIn forming the conclusion that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis the Directors have made the following assumptions that are relevant to the next t\nwelve months:\n-\nSufficient additional funding can be obtained for working capital purposes; and\n-\nIn the event that operating expenditure increases significantly as a result of successful progress with regards to the Phulbari Coal and Power Project, sufficien\nt funding can be obtained.\nWhile the Directors remain confident that necessary funds will be available as and when required, as at the date of this report these funding arrangements are not secured, the above conditions and events represent material uncertainties that may cast signi\nficant doubt over the Group's and Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and Company wer\ne unable to continue as a going concern.\nUpon achieving approval of the Phulbari Coal and Power Project, significant additional financial resources will be required to proceed to development.\nUse of judgements, estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.\nThe estimates and unde\nrlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision a\nffects both current and future periods.\nBorrowings - Note 12\nIn assessing the indebtedness of the Group to Polo Resources Ltd (\"Polo\"), as a result of the dissolution of Polo (See Note 12), Management considered the likelihood of Polo successfully being r\nestored as a registered Company in the BVI. The Management considered that as the restoration process was continuing it was prudent to continue to recognise the loan as a liability and continue to account in accordance with the terms of the Loan Facility.\nManagement do however note the Loan cannot be called in whilst Polo remains dissolved. Management will consider the likelihood of the successful restoration of Polo at each reporting date whilst polo remains dissolved.\nIntangibles - Note 9\nIn assessing the recoverability of intangible assets, if an impairment trigger under IFRS 6 is identified then intangibles are tested for impairment. Management have assessed various factors as impairment triggers including but not limited to, the delay in\nobtaining approval of the Scheme of Development, however have concluded that these do not meet the definition of an impairment indicator under IFRS 6. However, management have undertaken a further assessment to remain prudent to assess for recoverability,\nof which estimates are used to determine the expected net return on investment. The estimated return on investment takes into account estimated recoverable reserves, coal prices, development and production costs, capital investment requirements, discount\nrates and environmental and social costs among other things. Management has considered the estimated return on investment to be significantly higher than the current carrying value and therefore no impairment has been accounted for. The headroom in the val\nue in use calculation compared to the carrying value is not sensitive to probable changes in the key underlying assumptions. Refer to \"Political and economic risks - carrying value of intangible asset\" section within Note 1 for further details in respect o\nf the recoverability of intangible mining assets and the Board's judgement regarding the ultimate approval of the project being secured.\nPower plant development costs\nPower project expenditure is expensed as pre-development expenditure until it is probabl\ne that future economic benefits associated with the Project will flow to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably. To assess whether it is probable that future economic benefits will arise from the power plant development costs, management judgeme\nnt was required and considered: objective evidence that the power plant is technically and economically feasible, and objective evidence that the appropriate authorities of the Government of Bangladesh have, or are likely to approve power plant development\n. All power project expenditure were accordingly expensed in the year.\nBasis of consolidation\nWhere the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability\nof the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of\nthe Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies\nare therefore eliminated in full. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business co\nmbinations using the acquisition method. In the statement of financial position, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired opera\ntions are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.\nPower project development costs\nPower project expenditure is expensed as pre-development expenditure until it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the project will flow to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably. When it is probable that future economic bene\nfits will flow to the Group, all costs associated with developing a power plant project are capitalised as power project expenditure within property, plant and equipment category of tangible non-current assets. The capitalised expenditure will include appr\nopriate technical and administrative expenses but not general overheads. Power project assets are not depreciated until the asset is ready and available for use.\nIntangible assets\nExploration and evaluation costs are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets on an area of interest basis in accordance with IFRS 6. Costs such as geological and geophysical surveys, drilling and commercial appraisal costs, and other directly attr\nibutable costs of exploration and appraisal including technical and administrative costs, are capitalised as intangible exploration and evaluation assets.\nExploration and evaluation assets are only recognised if the rights of the area of interest are current and either:\n(i)\nthe expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and mining of the area of interest, or by its sale; or\n(ii)\nactivitie\ns in the area of interest have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing or\nplanned for the future.\nExploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability, and facts and circumstances suggest that the Group should test for impairment. In\nthe event that there is an indicator of impairment, the Group performs an impairment test in accordance with its policy on impairment as stated below. For the purposes of impairment testing, exploration and evaluation assets are allocated to cash-generatin\ng units to which the exploration activity relates.\nOnce the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclass\nified from intangible assets to mining property and development assets within property, plant and equipment.\nImpairment\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists,\nor when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs to sell and its value in us\ne and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is con\nsidered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of mon\ney and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognis\ned impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recover\nable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss. After such a reve\nrsal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\nClassification and measurement of financial assets\nThe initial classification of a financi\nal asset depends upon the Group's business model for managing its financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. The Group's financial assets are measured at amortised costs and are held within a business model whose objective is to hold ass\nets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest.\nThe Group's cash and cash equivalents and other receivables are measured at amortised cost\n. Other receivables are initially measured at fair value. The Group holds other receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash includes cash on hand and demand deposits with any bank or other financial institution. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to an insignificant risk of chan\nges in value.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (\"ECL's\") on its financial assets measured at amortised cost. Due to the nature of its financial assets, the Group measures loss allowances at an\namount equal to the lifetime ECLs. Lifetime ECLs are the anticipated ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial asset. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses.\nClassification and measurement o\nf financial liabilities\nA financial liability is initially classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as measured at FVTPL if it is held-for-trading, a derivative or designated as FVTPL on initial recognition.\nThe Group's accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term debt are measured at amortised cost.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Accounts payable and accrued l\niabilities are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period.\nShort-term debt is initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently they are measured at amortised cost\nusing the effective interest rate method. Short-term debt is classified as current when payment is due within 12 months after the reporting period.\nThe Group has no financial liabilities measured at FVTPL.\nWhere there is a modification to a financial li\nability, the financial original liability is de-recognised and a new financial liability is recognised at fair value in accordance with the Group's policy.\nOther loans and borrowings\nAll loans and borrowings which are financial instruments are initially recognised at the present value of cash payable to the lender (including interest). After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate metho\nd. The effective interest rate amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.\nIncome tax\nIncome tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised outside profit and loss, in which case it is recognised in other com\nprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate.\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of\nprevious years.\nDeferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n\u00b7\nwhere the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n\u00b7\nin res\npect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not rev\nerse in the foreseeable future; and\n\u00b7\ndeferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be\nutilised.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the bal\nance sheet date.\nForeign currency transactions\nTransactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the\nbalance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cos\nt in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\nShare based payments\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the recipients become fully entitled to the aw\nard. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions) or to condit\nions not related to performance or service (non-vesting conditions).\nWhere equity settled share based payments are made to non-employees the cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to fair value of the goods or services received and m\neasured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.\nWhere the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be estimated reliably, the entity measures the goods or services received, and the corresponding increa\nse in equity, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.\nAt each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calcula\nted, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management's best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to\na market condition or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described above.\nThis includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are not met.\nW\nhere the equity-settled share based payment is directly attributable to exploration and evaluation activities, the movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is capitalised, with a corresponding entry in equity. Otherwise, the mov\nement in cumulative expense is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.\nWhere the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the\noriginal award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fai\nr value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.\nWhere an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had ves\nted on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any\nexcess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.\nNew standards and interpretations applied\nThe Group has adopted all of the amended standards and interpretations during the year that are relevant to its operations, none of which had a material impact on the financial statements.\nNew standards and interpretations not applied\nIASB and IFRIC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements. These will be adopted in the period that they become mandatory, unless otherwise indicated. Information on the new\nstandards which could impact the Group is presented below\nEffective date\nAdoption date\nInternational Accounting Standards (IAS / IFRSs)\nAmendments to IAS 21 - Lack of Exchangeability\n1 January 2025\n1 January 2025\nAmendment to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 - Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments\n1 January 2026\n1 January 2026\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n1 January 2027\n1 January 2027\nIFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountab\nility: Disclosures\n1 January 2027\n1 January 2027\nBased on the current and foreseeable operations, the adoption of the above standards and interpretations will not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements in the period of initial application.\n2. Segment analysis\nThe Group operates in one segment being the exploration and evaluation of energy related projects.

The Company has been informed that the o\nfficers of Polo are currently undertaking steps to restore its status as a registered company in the BVI including the appointment of a new BVI agent. This is expected to occur following,\ninter alia\n, the satisfactory completion of customary due diligence o\nn Polo and its stakeholders by the new BVI agent, followed by a court order as required under the laws of the BVI. Notwithstanding this, there can be no certainty that Polo will be restored as a registered company in the BVI, nor as to the timing of any su\nch restoration. The board of directors of GCM believe that the Company's indebtedness to Polo which, at 30 June 2025 amounted to\u00a0\u00a36,198,000 including loan interest remains unaffected given the expectation that the officers of Polo will restore Polo's statu\ns as a registered company in the BVI, which at the date of this report, Polo continues to remain dissolved, and cannot call in any Loan Repayments whilst their status remains as such.\nAs a result of the amendment in terms noted below, the interest rate on\nthe loan facility increased from 15% to 16.5% effective 25 March 2024, and from 16.5% to 18% effective 25 March 2025.\nThe Company on 1 March 2022, as part of the completed placing and subscriptions, amended the terms of the loan facility, such that the len\nder may request conversion by the issuance of new ordinary shares in the Company at 5.14 pence per share (being the Issue Price) subject to any necessary regulatory approvals.

The lender has agreed that it will not serve a repayment request on the company for 5 years from the date of the agreement replacing the previous provision that it was payable on demand with 90 days' notice. The lender from 26 March\n2026, may request the borrower repays all or part of the utilised portion of the loan, however as noted above whilst the Lender remains dissolved, they are unable to issue any repayment request. The Company and Polo Resources Limited have agreed an increas\ne in the interest rate from 12% to 15% per annum rising by 1.5% on the third anniversary and by a subsequent 1.5% on each anniversary thereafter. Furthermore, the lender may request conversion by the issuance of new ordinary shares in the Company at 7.5 pe\nnce per share (being the Issue Price) subject to any necessary regulatory approvals. The Company may elect to repay all or part of the outstanding loan at any time giving 60 days' notice and with the agreement of Polo Resources Limited. Any share issue to\nthe Lender is conditional upon the Lender's interest, together with the interest of any parties with which it is in concert, remaining below 30% of the Company's issued capital. All other principal terms of the loan facility remain unchanged. Refer to the\nGroup accounting policies for details of Management judgement used in accounting for the loan amendment.\n13.

Financial Instr\numents\nThe Group holds cash as a liquid resource to fund the obligations of the Group.\nThe Group's strategy for managing cash is to maximise interest income whilst ensuring its availability to match the profile of the Group's expenditure.

The Group has no significant monetary assets or liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency.\nThe financial liabilities of the Group include trade payables and a short-term loan from a related party. Trade payables are recognised at fai\nr value on initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The short-term loan was recognised based on the present value of cash payable to the lender. As the short-term loan is payable within 12 months, the present value of the cash payab\nle was equal to the principal value of the loan.\nInterest rate risk\nThe interest rate maturity profile of the financial assets of the Group is as follows:\n2025\n\u00a3000\n2024\n\u00a3000\nFloating rate - within 1 year\nCash and cash equivalents\n-\n-\nOther interest bearing financial instruments which are subject to fixed rate interest charges are the Group's borrowings as disclosed in Note 12.\nOther financial instruments of the Group which are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to inte\nrest rate risk, are, non-interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents as at 30 June 2025 was \u00a31,310,000 (2024: \u00a31,658,000).\nCredit risk\nThe Group considers the credit ratings of banks in which it holds funds in order to manage exposure to credit risk and counterparty risk.

The Company has been informed that the officers of Polo are currently undertaking steps to restore its status as a registered company in the BVI including the appointment of a new BVI agent. This is expected to occur following,\ninter alia\n, the satisfactory completion of customary due diligence on Polo and its stakeholders by the new BVI agent, followed by a court order as required under the laws of the BVI. Notwithstanding this, there can be no certainty that Polo will be restored as a registered company in the BVI, nor as to the timing of any such restoration.\nAs most recently announced on 31 March 2025, Polo has provided a \u00a33.5 million loan facility to the Company of which as at 31 December 2024, \u00a3300,000 remained undrawn. The board of directors of GCM believe that the Company's indebtedness to Polo which, at 31 December 2024 amounted to \u00a35,923,000 including loan interest remains unaffected given the expectation that the officers of Polo will restore Polo's status as a registered company in the BVI.\nPrior to Polo's dissolution, Polo was the parent company of Polo Investments Limited (\"\nPolo Investments\n\"). Polo Investments is the registered legal holder of 43,328,253 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company, representing 12.88 per cent of the Company's issued share capital. Notwithstanding the status of Polo, Polo Investments remains as an active separate legal entity.\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj / Ashur Joseph\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nRichard Hutchison / Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM resource exploration and development, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.
