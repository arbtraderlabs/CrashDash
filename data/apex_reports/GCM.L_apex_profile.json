Progress remains subject to a number of factors, including the securing of the necessary approvals from the Government of Bangladesh (the \"Government\") to enable development of the Project. Against this backdrop, there has recently been a discernible shift in policy discussion within Bangladesh towards greater utilisation of the country's own natural resources. This has been reflected in initiatives led by the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, including discussions in March 2025 focusing on strategies and challenges relating to the coal-based energy sector. With national elections scheduled in Bangladesh on 12 February 2026 these developments suggest that a future government may give increased consideration to the development of domestic coal and other natural resources. While there can be no certainty that these broader policy discussions will translate into specific outcomes for the Project, the Board believes these trends are encouraging for the Company.\nIn light of the above the Board considers the Placing to be in the best interest of the Company's shareholders.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will provide the necessary working capital to support GCM's ongoing operations. These funds will be allocated to corporate overheads, legal and advisory costs, and general administrative expenses associated with managing the Company effectively.\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will help ensure that the Company is in the financial position to advance its broader strategic objectives.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe Placing comprises the issue of 15,244,000 new Ordinary Shares (the\n\"\nPlacing Shares\n\"\n) at the Issue Price to conditionally raise approximately \u00a31.25 million before expenses for the Company (approximately \u00a31.18 million after expenses but excluding VAT).\nThe Placing Shares will be issued\u00a0on a non-pre-emptive basis\u00a0utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the general meeting of the Company on 17 December 2025 (\"\n2025 AGM\n\").\nWhen issued, the Placing Shares will represent approximately 4.14 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the Company and will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares.\nPursuant to an engagement letter dated 10 February 2026 between Clear Capital and the Company (the \"\nPlacing Agreement\n\"), Clear Capital has, subject to certain conditions, procured subscribers for the Placing Shares at the Issue Price.\nThe Placing Agreement contains provisions entitling Clear Capital to terminate the Placing (and the arrangements associated with it), at any time prior to Admission in certain circumstances, including in the event of a material breach of the warranties given in the Placing Agreement, the failure of the Company to comply with its obligations under the Placing Agreement, or the occurrence of a force majeure event or a material adverse change affecting the financial position or business or prospects of the Company. If this right is exercised, the Placing will not proceed and any monies that have been received in respect of the Placing will be returned to the applicants without interest and Admission will not occur. The Company has agreed to pay Clear Capital a placing commission and all other costs and expenses of, or in connection with, the Placing.\nThe Placing is not being underwritten by Clear Capital or any other person.\nIssue of warrants\nIn addition, Clear Capital, who are acting as sole bookrunner in respect of the Placing, will be issued with 914,640 warrants to subscribe for\u00a0new Ordinary Share (\"Warrants\") at a price of 8.2 pence per Ordinary Share exercisable for a period of 3 years from Admission (as defined below).\nThe Warrants will not be admitted to trading on AIM or any other stock market. The issuance of the Warrants is subject to Admission and will be issued utilising the\u00a0authorities granted to the Board at the 2025 AGM.\nAdmission to AIM\nApplication has been made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is currently expected that Admission will occur at 8.00 a.m. on 16 February 2026 or such later time and/or date as Clear Capital and the Company may agree (being in any event no later than 8.00 a.m. on 16 February 2026).\nTotal voting rights\nOn Admission, the Company will have 368,202,790 ordinary shares of 1 pence each in issue, each with one voting right. There are no shares held in treasury. Therefore, upon Admission, the Company's total number of ordinary shares in issue and voting rights will be 368,202,790 and this figure may be used by shareholders from Admission as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nRichard Hutchison/ Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources plc\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM\nresource exploration and development company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.

The Ordinary Shares are not appropriate for a target market of investors whose objectives include no capital loss. Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Ordinary Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Ordinary Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Ordinary Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital projection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Clear Capital will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Ordinary Shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\".

The Ordinary Shares are not appropriate for a target market of investors whose objectives include no capital loss. Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Ordinary Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Ordinary Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Ordinary Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital projection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Clear Capital will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties.

Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\".

(\"\nPowerChina\n\") has agreed to an extension of the memorandum of understanding (\"\nMoU\n\") for a period of a further 24 months from 6 December 2025 to 6 December 2027 on the same terms as the previous memorandum of understanding which is primarily focused on the Phulbari coal mine development.\nIt is acknowledged that working under the MOU, the parties have already taken a significant step towards developing the Phulbari coal mine. This is demonstrated by the signing of an EPC contract for \"Phulbari Coal Mining Infrastructure Construction and Overburden Stripping\", which was announced by the Company on 11 March 2024. The scope of work under this contract includes the design, procurement, installation and commissioning of mine infrastructure and overburden removal, dewatering and drainage. It also includes selective mining and stockpiling of valuable industrial mineral co-products that occur in the overburden and are expected to deliver considerable cashflow for the Project ahead of any coal extraction. Importantly, the proposed mine development is now heading in the direction of contract mining which means that the mining is carried out by an experienced mining contractor utilising their own resources and mining equipment resulting in reduced technical risk and start-up capital expenditure requirement.\nWorking under this extended MOU, GCM and PowerChina aim to determine the modality for PowerChina to become involved in other packages of work and financing that are necessary to fully develop the Phulbari coal mine. PowerChina's involvement as a Mine Development Partner remains subject to the approval of PowerChina internal compliance and all other relevant regulatory agencies.\nMichael Tang, Chief Executive of GCM, commented\n:\n\"Working under the MOU, GCM and PowerChina will have the opportunity to finalise the remaining work packages necessary to bring the Phulbari coal mine into production. It also further strengthens our working relationship and demonstrates our ability to bring the Project to fruition. Having PowerChina as our Development Partner will greatly assist with obtaining the necessary Government approval and demonstrating that the proposed Phulbari coal mine will provide a large reliable supply of affordable commercial energy that will reduce the Country's dependence on expensive imported energy products.\"\nFor further information:\nGCM Resources plc\nKeith Fulton, Finance Director\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7290 1630\ninfo@gcmplc.com\nwww.gcmplc.com\nAllenby Capital Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nJohn Depasquale / Vivek Bhardwaj (Corporate Finance)\nKelly Gardiner / Lauren Wright (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)20 3328 5656\ninfo@allenbycapital.com\nAxis Capital Markets Limited\nJoint Broker\nRichard Hutchison / Lewis Jones\nTel: +44 (0)\u00a0203 026 0320\nAbout GCM Resources plc\nGCM Resources plc (LON: GCM), the AIM listed mining and energy company, has identified a high-quality coal resource of 572 million tonnes (JORC 2004 compliant) at the Phulbari Coal and Power Project (the \"Project\") in north-west Bangladesh.\nUtilising the latest highly energy efficient power generating technology the Phulbari coal mine can support some 6,600MW.
