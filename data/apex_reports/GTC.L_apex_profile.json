Receivables at 31 December 2025 totalled \u00a31.5m, with debt of \u00a30.15m.\n\u00b7\nAnnual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") at end FY25 was \u00a32.8m (2024: \u00a32.9m), expected to improve in 2026 backed by a pipeline of prospective clients looking to utilise the Globe platform under multi-year contracts.\n2026 Outlook:\n\u00b7\nIn 2025 Getech established itself as a market leader in the nascent but potentially vast Natural Hydrogen market via selective project identification and anticipates further focused activity in the current year.\n\u00b7\nPositive momentum has carried into 2026, supported by a deeper sales pipeline that offers greater visibility of increased future revenues and activity.\nChris Jepps, CEO of Getech, said:\n\"We have achieved the goals we set at the start of the year. We did this by resetting the Company cost base without restricting our ability to deliver projects and grow revenues, and by taking the business back to its roots by focusing on the markets we know best: Oil & Gas, Mining and Natural Hydrogen.\nThe trading performance has been very satisfying. Our objective now is to build momentum by continuing to grow our revenue lines and in particular focusing on materially adding to ARR via our subscription products, both with new clients and by expanding existing contracts.\nUltimately, we are looking to achieve a better balance across the business with a higher level of retained, predictable income that better covers the base costs of the business while allowing us to successfully close the harder to forecast material deals which will drive out-performance.\nAs a new management team we have taken some important strides in the last year and I believe we now have a solid platform to build upon.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulation No 596/2014 which is part of English Law by virtue of the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.

On 22nd January, Chris Jepps, previously Chief Operating Officer, was appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer. The immediate focus has been to re-set the financial balance of the business and move to being EBITDA positive. Within the first three months of the year, the annual cost base was reduced by c. 20%, a c. \u00a31 million reduction (on an annualised basis), achieved primarily through reducing headcount but without comprising the Group's ability to deliver for clients. In parallel, the Company set out a new, sustainable, business strategy, which re-focuses the Group on its traditional markets of Oil and Gas and Mining - where Getech has long-term relationships with many of the largest companies operating in these sectors - while continuing to progress high-quality, selective opportunities in Natural Hydrogen.\nIn H1, trading conditions remained challenging, nevertheless the Group expects to achieve revenues of \u00a32.09 million (H1 2024: \u00a32.15m) and due to efficiencies achieved, adjusted EBITDA is expected to have improved to a loss of \u00a30.1m (H1 2024: \u00a30.3m loss) despite an impact of \u00a30.1 million in reduced revenues due to factors outside of our control (such as adverse movements in foreign exchange), placing the Company on track to be EBITDA positive for the year.\nIn tandem with repositioning Company's strategy and re-setting the cost-base to improve profitability, the management team is focused on placing the Group on a path to increasing revenues. To achieve this objective, the sales team has been expanded in the US and the UK with two new appointments in 2025, including a new Sales Director. This key hire, previously engaged as an external consultant, is now a central part of the Sales team and responsible for implementing a new structure and approach to identifying and securing new business opportunities expedited by his existing knowledge of the Company.\nThe Group's largest market - the oil and gas sector - has recently benefitted from the change in US administration and the increase in global energy security concerns. However, uncertainty around trade tariffs, risk of global recession and decreasing oil prices have also presented some headwinds. Taken together and entering the traditionally stronger second half of the year, the Group continues to believe it has a sufficient pipeline of expected renewals and new business opportunities to meet the target of delivering mid-to-high single digit organic revenue growth and being EBITDA positive for 2025.\nFor a greater insight into the first six months of 2025, click on the following link to read a quickfire Q&A with Getech CEO Chris Jepps:\nhttps://getech.com/getech-investors/\n-- ENDS\nFor further information, please contact:\nGetech Group plc\nChris Jepps, CEO\nTel: 0113 322 2200\nMichael Covington, Chairman\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nDale Bellis / Jasper Berry (Sales)\nTel: 0207 397 8900\nNovella Communications\nTel: 0203 151 7008\nTim Robertson / Safia Colebrook\ngetech@novella-comms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nAbout Getech\nGetech is a leading locator of subsurface resources essential for the world's energy security and sustainable transition.

Pursuant to that Agreement, the parties are collaborating to explore for natural hydrogen and helium in Morocco. The initial phase of the Agreement comprised a regional screening study to identify areas of potential interest for more detailed assessment by the parties.\nGetech is pleased to report that the regional screening study has been completed and has identified areas of significantly elevated favourability for natural hydrogen and helium occurrence sufficient to warrant further study. Getech and Sound Energy incorporated the subsidiary HyMaroc Limited to negotiate jointly exclusive rights for the exploration and exploitation of hydrogen and helium resources in Morocco, progressing towards necessary geophysical and drilling activities to unlock potential deposits.\nMax Brouwers, CBDO at Getech\ncommented\n:\n\"Getech's unique hydrogen and helium exploration workflows are built on the twin foundations of our hugely valuable global geophysics data and our ability to understand and model the genetic factors involved in their formation; categorising the geological model into sources, migration paths, reservoirs, traps and seals in much the same way as the petroleum industry has successfully done for many decades.\nThe establishment of the Joint Venture company together with Sound Energy is the logical next step in our search for these resources in Morocco. It leverages and enhances our leading exploration capabilities in this emerging sector and keeps all commercial options open while requiring no material expenditure commitments. Our next steps are to conduct more detailed local-scale studies on potential in-place resources and secure acreage.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nGetech Group plc\nChris Jepps, CEO\nTel: 0113 322 2200\nMichael Covington, Chairman\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nMichael Johnson / Dale Bellis (Sales)\nTel: 0207 397 8900\nNovella Communications\nTel: 0203 151 7008\nTim Robertson / Safia Colebrook\ngetech@novella-comms.com\nNotes to Editors:\nAbout Getech\nGetech is a leading locator of subsurface resources essential for the world's energy security and sustainable transition.

Serving clients across corporates, government and regulators in a wide range of industries, Getech is committed to enabling energy and mineral security while supporting a shift towards low carbon sources.\nBackground\nMorocco is emerging as a highly prospective market for natural hydrogen exploration, thanks to its favourable geological conditions and strategic location. The country's extensive onshore basins, rich in subsurface resources, are prime candidates for natural hydrogen discoveries. Morocco's commitment to renewable energy and its supportive regulatory framework further enhance its role as a key player in the global energy transition.\nNatural (sometimes also referred to as \"white\", \"native\" or \"geologic\") hydrogen has the potential as a future disruptor in energy markets, undercutting green and other low-carbon hydrogen energy sources, at an estimated cost of around $1 per kilogram.\nHelium, crucial across sectors such as medical, electronics, aerospace, nuclear and telecommunications, is considered a \"critical raw material\" by the USA, EU, and Canada due to its irreplaceable nature. Helium and natural hydrogen are often found in the same reservoirs, significantly boosting the economic potential of such discoveries.\nEND\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Richard joined the Company as Non-Executive Chairman in January 2021, was appointed Interim Executive Chairman in February 2023 and then appointed CEO in February 2024. He led the Company's evolution to becoming a leading locator of natural resources for the Energy Transition and has now chosen to hand-over the CEO role and focus on his business interests in renewable energy.\nChris Jepps, the Chief Operating Officer of Getech since February 2018, has been appointed Interim CEO for an initial term of six months and will be supported by Max Brouwers, Chief Business Development Officer, who it is proposed will be appointed to the Board as an executive director. The proposed appointment of Mr Brouwers to the board of Getech remains subject to approval from the Company's nominated adviser and completion of the customary due diligence to satisfy itself as to board composition and the suitability of the proposed director for the purpose of the AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers, and a further announcement will be made in due course.\nMichael Covington, Chair of Getech, said:\n\"On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Richard for his visionary leadership and dedication. Richard has played important roles during his tenures in turn as Chair, Executive Chair and CEO. Under his leadership, Getech has made considerable progress in the diversification of the business beyond the Group's core oil and gas sector clients. Our portfolio of work increasingly supports exploration for sub-surface resources essential for the Energy Transition such as natural (or white) hydrogen, critical minerals and geothermal energy. We wish him continued success in the future.\nThe Board and executive leadership remain committed to executing Getech's strategic priorities. We will continue to deliver value-add for our customers -\nmany of whom have worked with us for over a decade\n. We\nare\nnow\nseeing renewed activity and interest in core markets such as oil & gas and critical minerals as security of supply is increasingly in focus due to heightened geopolitical uncertainty.\nIn parallel we offer\nnew and\ninnovative project workflows that produce valuable and novel insight to emerging sectors. For example, in the geothermal industry our expertise and data can prove essential for locating and modelling zones of sub-surface heat flow, while in the nascent natural hydrogen sector our geophysical data allows us to easily fingerprint potential hydrogen source rocks for further exploration.\"\nRichard Bennett added:\n\"It has been a great privilege to lead Getech and work alongside such a talented and dedicated team. I am proud of what we have accomplished together particularly the headway we have made into new markets such as critical minerals, geothermal and natural hydrogen. In Chris and Max the business has two excellent operators who I am confident will lead the Company successfully into the future.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nGetech Group plc\nChris Jepps, CEO\nTel: 0113 322 2200\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nMichael Johnson / Dale Bellis (Sales)\nTel: 0207 397 8900\nNovella Communications\nTel: 0203 151 7008\nTim Robertson / Claire de Groot / Safia Colebrook\ngetech@novella-comms.com\nNotes to editors:\nAbout Getech\nGetech is a\u00a0leading locator of\u00a0the energy and mineral resources essential for the world's energy transition.

On publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this information is considered to be in the public domain.\nGetech Group plc\n(\"Getech\" or the \"Company\")\nTrading Update\nGood progress in 2024, well positioned for an improved 2025\nGetech (AIM: GTC),\na world-leading locator of subsurface resources\n, is pleased to provide the following trading update for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe Company expects to report a 17% increase in revenues to \u00a34.7m (2023: \u00a34.0m). The rise in sales came from the retained client base and new\nservices\nincome from the growing portfolio of work supporting sub-surface exploration for materials connected to the Energy Transition such as natural or white hydrogen, battery materials or geothermal sources of energy. The Group orderbook\nas at 31 December 2024 was\n\u00a34.1m (2023: \u00a34.5m), with the slight reduction due to the successful unwinding of the contracted orderbook to revenue during the year.\nAnnual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") in FY24 was \u00a32.9m (2023: \u00a32.8m) with the management team continuing to focus on expanding ARR income through a subscription model and aiming to both add new clients and increase the scope of services and value-add provided to existing clients.\nIn August 2024, the Company raised gross proceeds of \u00a31.7m through a Placing and Retail Offer, thereby strengthening the financial position of the Company and providing new capital to invest in the Group's sales and R&D teams. As at 31 December 2024, the Company had net cash of \u00a30.9m (including a \u00a30.1m project security bond).\nCost reduction activity was a key focus in 2024. Approximately \u00a32m of annualised costs have been taken out of the business alongside the closure of the H2 Green projects. However, the cost reduction programme has taken longer to implement than initially estimated, impacting the EBITDA margin in FY24, and EBITDA is expected to be in the region of \u00a30.5m loss\n(2023: \u00a32.7m loss).\nHaving sold part of the Company's HQ in January 2024, the\nfinal\nbuilding, Nicholson House, is currently under offer. O\nnce sold, this will\nrelease \u00a3300k of net proceeds back to the business after repayment of the secured working capital facility.\nThe Company continues its diversification beyond the Group's core oil and gas sector clients into the Energy Transition. Utilising its market leading globally comprehensive magnetic, gravity and geoscience data, Getech is applying advanced AI and ML to search for new mineral and energy assets to accelerate the Energy Transition.\nNatural hydrogen is an area of strength as potential hydrogen\nsource rocks\ncan be quite clearly fingerprinted in magnetic and gravity data. Given this, Getech is quickly establishing itself in this\nnascent but potentially vast\nmarket, working on several searches during the course of 2024 alongside developing new joint exploration agreements which\nhave the potential to move the\nCompany from\nbeing a service provider to be more akin to an explorer with the\npossibility of\ngreater commercial returns.\nGeothermal is another area of expanding business development for Getech. For institutions and companies geothermal can be a highly sustainable and economic solution to meet future energy requirements. In July 2024, Getech was contracted to conduct a country-wide search for geothermal energy sources at a value of more than \u00a3180k, which represented the largest consulting project the Company has completed in recent years.\nOutlook for 2025\nAs part of our drive to increase revenues, the\nteam was expanded with two\nsales\nhires in\nrecent months\n, both focused on increasing recurring revenue from the Globe family of geoscience products and services. We see demand for data-led exploration increasing, particularly from organisations seeking to locate natural resources essential for the Energy Transition and expect to benefit from the investments we have made. We are expanding the drive to reduce costs and so better align the business with our revenue base. The Board is confident of a continued improvement in trading and in the outlook for the business.\nFor further information, please contact:\nGetech Group plc\nRichard Bennett, CEO\nChris Jepps, COO\nTel: 0113 322 2200\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nMichael Johnson / Dale Bellis (Sales)\nTel: 0207 397 8900\nNovella Communications\nTel: 0203 151 7008\nTim Robertson / Claire de Groot / Safia Colebrook\ngetech@novella-comms.com\nNotes to editors:\nAbout Getech\nGetech is a\u00a0leading locator of\u00a0the energy and mineral resources essential for the world's energy transition.

Meanwhile Sound Energy will contribute to the Agreement with specific regional geoscience knowledge and extensive operational expertise, from its long experience and established in-country capabilities as the largest onshore hydrocarbon exploration permit holder in Morocco, to facilitate any future exploration process.\nBoth companies will aim to jointly negotiate exclusive rights for the exploration and exploitation of hydrogen and helium resources in Morocco, progressing towards necessary geophysical and drilling activities to unlock potential deposits.\nRichard Bennett, CEO at Getech\n, commented:\n\"We look forward to collaborating with Sound Energy to unlock the potential of natural hydrogen and helium resources in Morocco. Getech's advanced geoscience solutions and AI capabilities will play a crucial role in driving cost-effective exploration in this highly promising region.\"\nJohn Argent, VP Geoscience at Sound Energy\n, commented:\n\"This agreement with Getech, a company with renowned geological expertise in the energy and mining sectors, is a significant first step forward in our strategy to expand our exploration activities into new transition energy resources, starting in Morocco. With our established presence and operational expertise, combined with Getech's innovative geoscience tools, we are well-positioned to lead the way in seeking to unlock Morocco's hydrogen and helium potential.\"\nBackground\nMorocco is emerging as a highly prospective market for natural hydrogen exploration, thanks to its favourable geological conditions and strategic location. The country's extensive onshore basins, rich in subsurface resources, are prime candidates for natural hydrogen discoveries. Morocco's commitment to renewable energy and its supportive regulatory framework further enhance its role as a key player in the global energy transition.\nNatural (sometimes also referred to as \"white\", \"gold\", \"geologic\" or \"native\") hydrogen has the potential as a future disruptor in the energy markets, undercutting green and other low-carbon hydrogen energy sources, produced without CO2 emissions, at an estimated cost of around $1 per kilogram. Getech's workflows build on the understanding of genetic factors involved in developing a natural hydrogen system; categorising these into sources, migration paths, reservoirs, traps and seals in much the same way as the petroleum industry has successfully done for many decades.\nHelium, crucial across sectors such as medical, electronics, aerospace, nuclear and telecommunications, is considered a \"critical raw material\" by the USA, EU, and Canada due to its irreplaceable nature. Helium and natural hydrogen are often found in the same reservoirs, significantly boosting the economic potential of such discoveries.\nFurther announcements will be made, as appropriate, in due course.\nFor further information, please contact:\nGetech Group plc\nRichard Bennett, CEO\nTel: 0113 322 2200\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nMichael Johnson / Dale Bellis (Sales)\nTel: 0207 397 8900\nNovella Communications\nTel: 0203 151 7008\nTim Robertson / Safia Colebrook\ngetech@novella-comms.com\nNotes to editors:\nAbout Getech\nGetech is a\u00a0leading locator of\u00a0the energy and mineral resources essential for the world's energy transition.

As a result, the Group is financially stable, more focused and better positioned to pursue its expanded pipeline of new business opportunities.\nFollowing a strategic review, the Group was refocused on to its core strength of data-led subsurface exploration. As part of this process, the loss-making green hydrogen business H2 Green was closed, enabling a 28% reduction in the Group's cost base. Alongside these actions, the Group continued its migration to a recurring income Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with supporting consulting services aimed at delivering sustainable annual recurring revenues.\nSubsurface exploration activity has increased substantially in parallel with the global move to deliver a low carbon environment, known as the Energy Transition. As the owner of the largest database of potential fields data, coupled with the Company's extensive geoscience expertise, Getech is well placed to apply its subsurface data and expertise to help exploration companies find these vital energy resources.\nFinancial Results\nIn the six months under review, the Group generated\nrevenues of \u00a32.2 million (H1 2023: \u00a31.9 million) an increase of 16%. The contractually committed orderbook grew to \u00a34.7 million (31 December 2023: \u00a34.6 million) with \u00a31.7 million of the orderbook expected to convert to revenue in H2 20\n24, and a further \u00a31.5 million due i\nn FY 2025.\nAnnualised recurring revenue ",

Given the significant demand, existing Shareholders received 100 per cent. of their soft pre-emptive allowance, when their order matched or exceeded their soft pre-emptive allowance. Where the order was greater than the soft pre-emptive allowance shareholders received c.3.76% of their additional demand1.\nOther than where defined, capitalised terms used in this Announcement have the meanings given to them in the Retail Offer Announcement.\nConsequently, it is anticipated that 75,000,000 Placing and Subscription Shares and 10,000,000 Retail Offer Shares (together, the \"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") resulting in a total of 85,000,000 New Ordinary Shares will be issued in relation to the Fundraising.\nCompletion of the Retail Offer is conditional, inter alia, upon approval of the Shareholders at the General Meeting to be held at 10.00 a.m. on 27 August 2024, the Placing becoming unconditional and on Admission of the New Ordinary Shares. It is expected that Admission of the New Ordinary Shares will become effective and that dealings will commence at or around 8.00 a.m. on 28 August 2024.\nFollowing Admission of the New Ordinary Shares, the Company will have 152,474,375 Ordinary Shares in issue. The New Ordinary Shares to be issued, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue.\nRichard Bennett, CEO of Getech Group plc, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have received good demand for this retail offer and to be able to ensure that all shareholders have had the opportunity to maintain their shareholdings. With the new capital raised, shareholders have strengthened the overall financial position of the business and provided the funds to invest behind growing Group revenues.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nGetech Group plc\nTel: 0113 322 2200\nRichard Bennett, CEO\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nTel: 020 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nDale Bellis / Jasper Berry (Sales)\nNovella Communications\nTel: 0203 151 7008\nTim Robertson / Safia Colebrook\ngetech@novella-comms.com\n1\n- Soft Pre-emptive allowance Calculation: Existing shares X 125.974 % (Dilution from total new shares being issued) = Soft Pre-emptive allowance allocation shares\nAdditional Demand: (Total Order shares - Soft Pre-emptive allowance allocation shares) x c.3.76% = Additional demand allocation shares\nFurther information on the Company can be found on its website a",

Alyson Levitt, who is not participating in the Fundraising, and is therefore considered to be an independent Director for the purposes of the Fundraising, considers, having consulted with Cavendish Capital Markets Limited, that the terms of the related party transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as the Shareholders are concerned.\nAdmission & Total Voting Rights\nCompletion of the Placing and Subscription remains subject, inter alia, to Admission of the Placing and Subscription Shares.\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the New Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM.

Receivables at 31 December 2025 totalled \u00a31.5m, with debt of \u00a30.15m.\n\u00b7\nAnnual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") at end FY25 was \u00a32.8m (2024: \u00a32.9m), expected to improve in 2026 backed by a pipeline of prospective clients looking to utilise the Globe platform under multi-year contracts.\n2026 Outlook:\n\u00b7\nIn 2025 Getech established itself as a market leader in the nascent but potentially vast Natural Hydrogen market via selective project identification and anticipates further focused activity in the current year.\n\u00b7\nPositive momentum has carried into 2026, supported by a deeper sales pipeline that offers greater visibility of increased future revenues and activity.\nChris Jepps, CEO of Getech, said:\n\"We have achieved the goals we set at the start of the year. We did this by resetting the Company cost base without restricting our ability to deliver projects and grow revenues, and by taking the business back to its roots by focusing on the markets we know best: Oil & Gas, Mining and Natural Hydrogen.\nThe trading performance has been very satisfying. Our objective now is to build momentum by continuing to grow our revenue lines and in particular focusing on materially adding to ARR via our subscription products, both with new clients and by expanding existing contracts.\nUltimately, we are looking to achieve a better balance across the business with a higher level of retained, predictable income that better covers the base costs of the business while allowing us to successfully close the harder to forecast material deals which will drive out-performance.\nAs a new management team we have taken some important strides in the last year and I believe we now have a solid platform to build upon.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information as stipulated under the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulation No 596/2014 which is part of English Law by virtue of the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.

Initially focused on North America, Kingfisher has narrowed its search over the last year to a previously overlooked exploration fairway in Canada with significant hydrogen and helium potential. Getech was approached by Kingfisher to deploy its gravity and magnetics capabilities and geoscience understanding to analyse this region and add to Kingfisher's own technical expertise and access to local data. The contracts have commenced and the two companies are working successfully together with a series of potential project areas for both hydrogen and helium already identified.",

Both projects will supply green hydrogen to whisky distilleries and their supply chain in Scotland.\u00a0 ScottishPower is also taking forward a feasibility study for a 100MW production plant at the Port of Felixstowe with support from the UK Government\u2019s Net Zero Hydrogen Fund. ScottishPower is advancing key projects that align with the UK Government\u2019s hydrogen strategy, decarbonising critical sectors through renewable energy.",
