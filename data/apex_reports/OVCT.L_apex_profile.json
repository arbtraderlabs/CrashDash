          "content": "16 Sep 2024 07:00\nOberon AIM VCT plc\nFor the six months to 30 June 2024\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nAt its recent AGM, the Company (Trust/OVCT/Fund) changed its name from New Century AIM VCT2 plc to Oberon AIM VCT plc on 3 July 2024. The new ticker for the Company is OVCT.\nThe board see this as a new dawn for the Trust.\nThere are very few attractive tax efficient investments in the UK market, however, with the UK government having recently approved the extension of the \u2018sunset clause\u2019 for the VCT regime for a further 10 years until 5 April 2035 (which has also recently been ratified by the EU), the VCT sector is one of them.\nFurthermore, while there are numerous VCTs investing in unlisted equities, there are currently only 7 VCTs in existence that invest in listed (i.e. stockmarket) AIM stocks. The board\u2019s view is that the transparency of the underlying investments in an AIM VCT, (and daily valuations), give investors an attractive, transparent and understandable tax efficient investment (which is arguably more attractive than other non-listed VCT competitors).\nPrior to the AGM we wrote to shareholders explaining that we, as a board, wished to use the opportunity to create an attractive vehicle into which current and new shareholders could invest.\nOur proposal was to relaunch the VCT, by committing resources into the VCT\u2019s long term future to enable us to provide an attractive and tax efficient investment proposition for our shareholders. The resolutions were strongly supported with over 75% of shareholders voting for all resolutions, backing us to expand the Trust and invest in its future.\nFollowing this approval by the Company\u2019s shareholders, we are now looking to grow the VCT and take advantage of what the directors feel is the over-due end of a long bear market in smaller companies. The AIM market has been under-performing over a long period and, as with almost all cycles, we believe this will change and the small cap/AIM market should begin to recover. As a result, the Oberon VCT is one of the few companies, with very attractive tax incentives, in a position to take advantage of this situation.\nThe AIM Allshare index has performed relatively poorly over the last one, three and five years, however the board believe (as has been experienced in most market cycles over the last few decades) that the tide is turning and that opportunities are now beginning to appear. We do not believe that the small cap and entrepreneurial market is dead nor do we think that for some reason this time is \u2018different\u2019- we firmly believe this sector will recover.\nAs part of this drive to grow your company, provide more opportunities, and make the Trust more attractive, I am pleased to say that your board, in partnership with Oberon Investments Limited (OIL), our Investment Manager, has come to an agreement that Oberon will charge no investment management fees for the next 12 months. Oberon will also be underwriting the directors\u2019 costs (which we have continually kept very low) to the tune of \u00a35,000. As a result, the directors have agreed to take no remuneration from the Company for the next 12 months as we grow the Trust to a commercial level.\nTo take advantage of this, we are now implementing a number of changes:\nTowards the end of 2024, we expect to issue a new prospectus, outlining the new approach of the Fund and the potential opportunity these tax incentives and the current levels of the AIM market may offer. This will give the Trust the option to bring in new investors, which, in turn, will provide new opportunities and liquidity to take advantage of new issues in the AIM market.The result of a successful fundraise will also reduce the costs of the Company as a percentage of our market capitalisation.We understand that OIL will be giving further guidance on its commitment and investment into our Fund offering, both with regard to a new, larger investment team, under the guidance of Simon Like (the Investment Manager), along with further financial support to the Trust as it grows to a commercial size.In addition OIL is looking to invest in the expansion of the research and investment capability of the Trust by underwriting research and due diligence costs on its new investments.We will also look to add to the board composition under the guidance of myself as Chairman and the current team of directors.\nAs a result of the combined efforts of the board and our colleagues at OIL, we feel there is now a fantastic opportunity for the Trust. While there is no certainty about the future, following a number of years of underperformance of small caps and the AIM market, the board feels that history is in our favour and that we may be coming towards the end of a long bear market cycle. Should this be the case, we feel the re-launch of the Trust is well timed and your Fund is well placed to profit from this.\nWe will be issuing updates on a regular basis over the next few months and we look forward to what we feel is a very exciting opportuni"
