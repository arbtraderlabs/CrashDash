On publication of this announcement via a regulatory information service, this information is considered to be in the public domain.\n16 January 2026\nOBERON AIM VCT PLC\n(the \u201c\nCompany\n\u201d)\nIssue of Equity and Total Voting Rights\nThe Company announced on 12 February 2025 that it had published a prospectus (the \"Prospectus\") in relation to an offer for subscription of ordinary shares of 10p each (the \"Ordinary Shares\"), to raise up to \u00a35m, with the discretion to utilise an over-allotment facility to raise up to a further \u00a33.4m (the \"Offer\"). On 15 January 2026 the Company allotted a further 61,955 new Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Offer conditional only on Admission (the timetable for which is set out in more detail below). The total amount of shares, including this issue, which have now been issued pursuant to the Offer is now 1,933,769 shares.\nThe offer price at which the 61,955 new Ordinary Shares were allotted was 28.25 pence per Ordinary Share, which was calculated, in accordance with the terms of the Offer, by reference to the net asset value of an Ordinary Share on 31 December 2025 of 27.54 pence per share (as announced on 13 January 2026), being the last published net asset value per Ordinary Share, divided by 0.975 (to allow for the costs of the Offer).\nApplication will shortly be made for the 61,955 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc\u2019s main market for listed securities (\"\nAdmission\n\"). It is expected that Admission will occur and dealing will commence in the new Ordinary Shares on or around 21 January 2026. When issued, the new Ordinary Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Ordinary Shares.\nAs a result of the issue, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 7,072,013 with each Ordinary Share carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company will be 7,072,013. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nUnless the context requires otherwise, terms defined in the Prospectus have the same meaning where used in this announcement.\nEND\nFor further information, please contact:\nCompany Secretary\nJohn Beaumont\n+44 203 179 5300\nLEI: 213800ZDLLGLVL2YTB47\nView source version on businesswire.com:\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115249486/en/\nCopyright Business Wire 2026"
