Working in collaboration with organisations, we're on a mission to accelerate positive change and build a future where people, places and the planet are supported to thrive.\nLed by passionate people, TPXimpact works closely with its clients in agile, multidisciplinary teams; challenging assumptions, testing new approaches and building confidence and capabilities. Combining our rich heritage with expertise in human-centred design, data, experience and technology, we work to create sustainable solutions with the flexibility to learn, evolve and change.\nThe business is being increasingly recognised as a leading alternative digital transformation provider to the UK public services sector, with over 90% of its client base representing public services.\nMore information is available at\nwww.tpximpact.com\n.\nCEO's statement\nOverview\nThe Group is on track to achieve its full-year adjusted EBITDA objectives and it's pleasing to see improving gross margins and operational efficiency translate into net debt reducing faster than previously planned.\nWe are two and a half years into our three year transformation plan for TPXimpact. During this time we have moved away from a collection of sub-scale businesses to three individually branded businesses focused on very distinct client segments and their needs: TPXimpact - an end-to-end digital transformation partner for the public sector; KITS - programme recovery and managed services provision for the public sector; manifesto - digital experience and engagement for the not for profit, visit and attractions sector.\nUnderlying business performance has improved consistently over the same period with gross margin and adjusted EBITDA up substantially and improved cash generation leading to much reduced net debt - all whilst delivering large, complex programmes that help our clients meet challenging objectives.\nThe combination of consolidation into clear client-facing business units, improved systems, and stronger financials provides a strong platform for future growth in a market that is starting to normalise after the general election, spending reviews and budgets.\nTo capitalise on this opportunity, we are actively investing in our sales capability within our new business development and account management teams.\nMarket Context and Trading Performance\nThe medium-term demand for our services remains strong. We have concentrated our effort on three areas: place & infrastructure, transforming government, and health. These have proved to be resilient priorities for the UK Government through the allocation of funding in recent budgets and spending reviews.\nHis Majesty's Land Registry (a 4-year, \u00a349m contract) is our largest client and we have delivered tens of work packages as their digital transformation partner. Our work helps HMLR improve their operations and directly contributes to the UK Government's growth agenda.\nA new client this year is His Majesty's Prison & Probation Service (a \u00a39m contract), where we are bringing our latest innovations and insights to deliver the digital transformation that enhances justice services.\nOur clients benefit from a unique combination of people who have walked in their shoes, the latest design, data and technology thinking, and our ability to work with our clients to deliver early, tangible value and long-lasting solutions.\nNew business wins in the first half of FY26 (\u00a331m) are similar to the pre-election levels in the first half of FY25 (\u00a335m) and we are encouraged by the improving pipeline of opportunities we see in our chosen areas of focus. This, along with broader commentary across our sector, gives us good confidence in the medium-term outlook for TPXimpact.\nWe are proud of the relationships we have built across various government departments, and our reputation for delivering against client outcomes is reflected in our healthy average tenure, with four fifths of all revenue coming from clients we have worked with for at least 3 years.\nInterest in AI has continued to move at pace. Gaining advantage from the benefit of AI-enabled solutions whilst operating in a data-safe and ethical way is becoming a core requirement. At TPXimpact we advise on strategies to be successful in this new world and develop solutions for clients that utilise AI to deepen citizen engagement with services, improve operational effectiveness, and drive efficiencies. A good example is the delivery of an AI-powered knowledge tool that helps staff in a major Government body accelerate complex casework, improving the experience and outcomes for applicants.\nWe are AI practitioners, using AI enabled tools in our own business and we provide an agentic data analytics service through the Oracle Cloud.\nDemonstrating Social Value\nSocial value is incredibly important to our public sector clients and this is reflected through their scoring of tenders, typically 10-20% of the marks. It is also incredibly important to our teams as it is a manifestation of the PACT values: Purpose, Accountability, Craft, and Togetherness, that are central to how we operate and are an attraction for joining and staying at TPXimpact. Being a B-Corp certified business is an external validation of our strength in social value delivery and we continue to embed inclusion and sustainability across the business.\nEmployee engagement remains strong with the staff retention rate increasing to 91% (FY25: 86%). Permanent staff numbers reduced slightly to 405 (FY25: 431) reflecting disciplined workforce management to reflect our client's needs for specific skill sets and our focus on operational performance.\nOur Modern Slavery Assessment Tool (MSAT) score improved to 90% (FY25: 88%), evidencing further progress in supply chain oversight and ethical standards.This ongoing commitment to transparency and responsible business practice was recognised externally, with TPXimpact winning the\nIR Impact Awards - Europe for Best ESG Reporting\nand being shortlisted at the\nIR Society Awards for Best Communication of Sustainability\n.\nThis reinforces TPXimpact's position as a leading purpose-led, inclusive, and responsible organisation, aligned with the priorities of our public-sector partners and the expectations of our wider stakeholders.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, we are encouraged by the growing stability within the UK Government and increasing evidence of renewed public-sector investment in digital transformation. The structural drivers behind our markets, efficiency, automation and responsible AI, remain firmly in place, supported by clear policy priorities and an improved funding outlook.\nWith a healthy pipeline, stronger balance sheet and a proven capacity to execute, TPXimpact is well-positioned to benefit as market activity builds through the second half. Our priorities are clear: convert pipeline opportunities, sustain profitability improvements and continue to reduce leverage through disciplined cash management.\nBjorn Conway\nCEO, TPXimpact\n2 December 2025\nFinancial Review\nOverview\nThe interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2025 (\"H126\") are consistent with management's expectations and demonstrate continued progress strengthening TPXimpact's financial position. Whilst revenue was slightly down year-on-year, profitability, cash generation and leverage have all improved as a result of disciplined cost control, stronger project execution and the benefits of a leaner operating model.\nRevenue for the first half was \u00a336.2m (H125: \u00a337.8m), with the small decrease reflecting timing delays in public sector procurement activity following the Spending Review, partly offset by continued demand in place and infrastructure and justice.\nGross margin improved to 31.0% (H125: 28.3%), driven by higher utilisation and robust pricing.\nOperational Efficiency and Cost Management\nHeadcount, including associates, decreased by 9% to 552 at 30 September 2025 (FY25: 608), reflecting a continued focus on efficiency and selective hiring. The ratio of permanent staff to associates remains broadly stable at ~70:30, maintaining delivery flexibility while improving margin resilience.\nEmployee retention has remained strong at 91% (FY25: 86%), demonstrating the continued appeal of the Company's employee proposition and purpose-driven culture.\nProfitability\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first half increased to \u00a33.2m (H125: \u00a32.3m), reflecting the benefit of cost efficiencies, improved utilisation, and tighter project delivery. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 8.8% (H125: 6.1%).\nReported operating loss was \u00a3(1.1)m (H125: \u00a3(3.4)m), including intangible amortisation and depreciation of \u00a32.8m (H125: \u00a33.2m), share-based payment charges of \u00a30.8m (H125: \u00a30.9m), and restructuring and transformation costs of \u00a30.7m (H125: \u00a31.5m). Adjusted profit before tax increased to \u00a32.2m (H125: \u00a31.1m), with reported loss before tax improving to \u00a3(1.7)m (H125: \u00a3(4.1)m).\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased to 1.7p (H125: 1.2p), and reported diluted loss per share was (1.6)p (H125: (3.6)p). No interim dividend is proposed for the period (H125: nil).\nNet Debt and Cash Flow\nThe Group continued to strengthen its balance sheet during the period, with gross debt falling to \u00a37.1m (FY25: \u00a313.2m). Net debt (excluding lease liabilities) at 30 September 2025 was \u00a37.0m (FY25: \u00a38.5m), reflecting solid cash generation over the period.\nOperating cash flow before working capital movements was \u00a32.5m (H125: \u00a30.8m), with improved debtor collections offsetting modest seasonal outflows. Debtor days improved further to 26 days (FY25: 37 days) due to favourable timing differences in cash collection over the period.\nNet finance costs reduced to \u00a30.5m (H125: \u00a30.7m), reflecting reduced average borrowings. Leverage (net debt/ 12-month adjusted EBITDA) at 30 September 2025 was 1.1x, comfortably within banking covenants and consistent with previous full year guidance of 1.0-1.5x.\nOutlook\nTrading post-period is in line with management's expectations. The pipeline remains healthy, and active engagements give clear revenue and adjusted EBITDA visibility for the remainder of the year and beyond.\nTPXimpact enters the second half of FY26 with lower debt levels, a lean cost base, and a clear focus on margin expansion and cash generation. We expect a modest second-half weighting to the year as existing programmes expand and pipeline activity increases.\nThe fundamental drivers of digital transformation-efficiency, automation, and responsible AI adoption-remain strong, providing a supportive market backdrop.\nGiven the current momentum of the Group, the Board is pleased to:\n\u25cf Reaffirm Adjusted EBITDA outlook of\n\u00a36-7m\nfor the current financial year, and\n\u25cf Update the net debt target to\nbelow \u00a36m\nat year-end, and reduce the anticipated leverage ratio to\nbelow 1.0x\nat year-end.\nWith a stronger financial foundation, improving margins, and a clear commitment to disciplined execution, TPXimpact is well-positioned to deliver sustainable growth and value creation over the medium term.\nNoel Douglas\nCFO, TPXimpact\n2 December 2025\nUnaudited interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2025\nConsolidated Income Statement\nFor the six months ended 30 September

General information\nTPXimpact\nHoldings plc is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 with registered number 10533096. The Company's shares are publicly traded on AIM, part of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe address of the registered office is 2nd Floor, The Hickman, 2 Whitechapel Road, London, E1 1EW. The principal activity of the Group is the provision of digitally native technology services to clients within the commercial, government and non-government organisation (NGO) sectors.\nThe interim financial information is unaudited.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThe Group has not applied IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, which is not mandatory for UK AIM listed companies, in the preparation of this half-yearly report.\nThe consolidated interim financial information for the six months ended 30 September 2025 does not, therefore, comply with all the requirements of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The consolidated interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of TPXimpact Holdings plc for the year ended 31 March 2025, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, with the Companies Act 2006 and the AIM rules for Companies.\nThis consolidated interim financial information does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the Board of directors and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts issued an unqualified opinion and did not contain any statement under sections 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The auditor's report drew attention by way of an emphasis of matter to the high degree of judgement involved in forecasting sales growth and EBITDA margins, to support the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe interim financial statements are presented in pound sterling (GBP), which is the functional currency of the parent company.\n3. Basis of consolidation\nThese interim consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 September 2025. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control may cease. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.\n4. Accounting policies\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the interim consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 September 2025 are in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are consistent with those which were adopted in the annual statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\n5. Borrowings\nAt 31 March 2025, the Group had a revolving credit facility (\"RCF\") with HSBC of \u00a325m with a \u00a315m accordion of which \u00a313.2m had been drawn down.\nIn July 2025, the Group refinanced the RCF with its bankers. The existing \u00a325m RCF, due to mature in July 2026, was reduced to \u00a311m with a \u00a35.5m accordion, and a \u00a34m overdraft (renewed annually). The new RCF has an initial term of three years and may be extended by one year by mutual agreement, with a further option to extend for an additional year thereafter. Under the terms of the RCF, the covenants now comprise two measures to be assessed at each quarter end: (i) Net debt (excluding lease liabilities) to rolling twelve month Adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x or less; and (ii) rolling twelve month Adjusted EBITDA to net finance costs of at least 4.0x. The Group satisfied these revised covenants throughout the period from refinancing to 30 September 2025. Borrowings of \u00a37.2m were repaid during the period ended 30 September 2025.\n6.

Alternative performance measures (unaudited)\nIn measuring our performance, the financial measures that we use include those which have been derived from our reported results in order to eliminate factors which distort period-on-period comparisons. These are considered non-GAAP financial measures, and include measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net debt (excluding lease liabilities). We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to shareholders and analysts in providing a basis for measuring our financial performance.\nReconciliation of net debt (excluding lease liabilities):\n30 September\n2025\n30 September\n2024\n31 March\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCash and cash equivalents as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position\n-\n4,167\n4,647\nBank overdrafts1\n(1,112)\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents as presented in the consolidated cash flow statement\n(1,112)\n4,167\n4,647\nBorrowings due after one year\n(5,896)\n(12,060)\n(13,145)\nNet debt\n(7,008)\n(7,893)\n(8,498)\n1\nBank overdrafts are included in short-term borrowings in the Group's balance sheet.
