The Competent Persons Report (\"CPR\") now ascribes almost 1 TCF of net mean unrisked Prospective Resources to the Temaris block.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nKeladi prospect upgrade to 423 bcf (+125%) with a 45% GCoS\n\u00b7\nNew Tembakau North prospect (29 bcf, 58% GCoS) identified representing a high impact, low risk, nearfield target which could be drilled from a planned Tembakau field platform\n\u00b7\nGeophysical analysis and amplitude mapping demonstrates the Keladi prospect as being located up-dip and part of the same channel system as the Tembakau gas field\n\u00b7\nTotal Temaris net mean unrisked Prospective Resources of 950 bcf (+38%), illustrating significant running room beyond the Tembakau gas field itself\nAll resources quoted herein are mean unrisked Prospective Resources as defined by PMRS Standard (as detailed below).\nPierre Eliet, Executive Director and Country Chair Malaysia,\ncommented:\n\"The Sproule ERCE independent resource update validates the high quality nature of the Temaris block and our significant resource base. We are particularly encouraged by the Keladi prospect, where mean unrisked Prospective Resources have more than doubled.\nThese results, along with Tembakau, position Temaris to become a transformative gas hub for Peninsular Malaysia's growing energy demand.\"\nThe upgrade at Keladi reflects a period of detailed work by the Seascape subsurface team using updated data and high-end geophysical techniques to extract seismic amplitudes which allow for more accurate mapping of the Miocene channel systems sitting at multiple horizons across the Temaris block to the west of Tembakau in the same channel play.\nThe CPR is an important independent third-party verification of Seascape's resource figures. The report confirms (and in the case of Temaris, upgrades) management's technical view of resources at the time of license application.\nIn addition to the Tembakau field (246 Bcf 2C Contingent Resource) and the two largest prospects (Allemanda, Keladi totaling 830 Bcf mean Prospective Resources), the updated work shows several additional near-field exploration targets totaling over 110 bcf within 5 km of the Tembakau field and accessible from a planned Tembakau platform.\nTemaris Block Prospects: Unrisked Net Mean Prospective Resources\nProspect(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nGCoS%\nKeladi\n423\n70\n45%\nAllamanda\n406\n68\n30%\nKangkung *\n66\n11\n38%\nTembakau North *\n29\n5\n58%\nTerung\n*\n23\n4\n50%\nMengkuang South\n4\n1\n65%\nTotal\n950\n158\nSource: Sproule\nERCE, numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n*\nAccessible from the planned Tembakau field platforms\nEnds\nEnquiries:\nSeascape Energy Asia\nplc\nIR@seascape-energy.com\nJames Menzies (Executive Chairman)\nNick Ingrassia (Chief Executive)\nPierre Eliet (Executive Director)\nStifel\n(Nomad\nand\nJoint\nBroker)\nTel: +44 20 7710\n7600\nCallum Stewart\nJason\nGrossman\nAshton\nClanfield\nSNELSeascape@Stifel.com\nCavendish\nCapital\nMarkets\nLimited\n(Joint\nBroker)\nTel: +44 20 7397\n8900\nNeil\nMcDonald\nPete\nLynch\nStandard\nEstimates of reserves and resources have been carried out in accordance with the June 2018 SPE/WPC/AAPG/ SPEE/SEG/SPWLA/EAGE Petroleum Resources Management System (\"PRMS\") as the standard for classification and reporting.

There is no certainty it will be commercially viable to develop any of the Contingent Resources.\n6.
