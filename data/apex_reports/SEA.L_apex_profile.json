We are particularly encouraged by the Keladi prospect, where mean unrisked Prospective Resources have more than doubled.\nThese results, along with Tembakau, position Temaris to become a transformative gas hub for Peninsular Malaysia's growing energy demand.\"\nThe upgrade at Keladi reflects a period of detailed work by the Seascape subsurface team using updated data and high-end geophysical techniques to extract seismic amplitudes which allow for more accurate mapping of the Miocene channel systems sitting at multiple horizons across the Temaris block to the west of Tembakau in the same channel play.\nThe CPR is an important independent third-party verification of Seascape's resource figures. The report confirms (and in the case of Temaris, upgrades) management's technical view of resources at the time of license application.\nIn addition to the Tembakau field (246 Bcf 2C Contingent Resource) and the two largest prospects (Allemanda, Keladi totaling 830 Bcf mean Prospective Resources), the updated work shows several additional near-field exploration targets totaling over 110 bcf within 5 km of the Tembakau field and accessible from a planned Tembakau platform.\nTemaris Block Prospects: Unrisked Net Mean Prospective Resources\nProspect(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nGCoS%\nKeladi\n423\n70\n45%\nAllamanda\n406\n68\n30%\nKangkung *\n66\n11\n38%\nTembakau North *\n29\n5\n58%\nTerung\n*\n23\n4\n50%\nMengkuang South\n4\n1\n65%\nTotal\n950\n158\nSource: Sproule\nERCE, numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n*\nAccessible from the planned Tembakau field platforms\nEnds\nEnquiries:\nSeascape Energy Asia\nplc\nIR@seascape-energy.com\nJames Menzies (Executive Chairman)\nNick Ingrassia (Chief Executive)\nPierre Eliet (Executive Director)\nStifel\n(Nomad\nand\nJoint\nBroker)\nTel: +44 20 7710\n7600\nCallum Stewart\nJason\nGrossman\nAshton\nClanfield\nSNELSeascape@Stifel.com\nCavendish\nCapital\nMarkets\nLimited\n(Joint\nBroker)\nTel: +44 20 7397\n8900\nNeil\nMcDonald\nPete\nLynch\nStandard\nEstimates of reserves and resources have been carried out in accordance with the June 2018 SPE/WPC/AAPG/ SPEE/SEG/SPWLA/EAGE Petroleum Resources Management System (\"PRMS\") as the standard for classification and reporting.

The report confirms (and in the case of Temaris, upgrades) management's technical view of resources at the time of license application. Importantly, the CPR highlights new prospective potential in the recently awarded Temaris block.\nSeascape has rapidly built a high quality, gas-dominant portfolio using its competitive advantages in Malaysia, illustrating how the Company has created significant value using its key strengths.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nTemaris PSC net 2C Contingent Resources of 276 bcf vs 250 bcf estimated at award\n\u00b7\nExploration upside on Temaris PSC of 683 bcf (114 mmboe) mean Prospective Resources located in amplitude-supported prospects analogous to the existing discoveries\n\u00b7\nTotal net 2C Contingent Resources of 63 mmboe (97% gas), up from nil in past 12 months\n\u00b7\nTotal unrisked net mean Prospective Resources of 281 mmboe (95% gas), an increase of 69% since completion of the Block 2A farm-down in Q1 2025\nNet 2C Contingent\nResources\nField(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nLiquids\n(mmbbl)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nTemaris\n(100%)\n276\n-\n46\nDEWA priority fields\n(28%)\n94\n2\n18\nTotal\n370\n2\n63\nNet\nMean\nProspective\nResources\nField(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nLiquids\n(mmbbl)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nGCoS\nRange\n(%)\nTemaris\n(100%)\n683\n-\n114\n30% -\n50%\nDEWA priority fields\n(28%)\n7\n0\n1\n34% -\n51%\nBlock 2A\n(10%)\n908\n15\n166\n16% -\n27%\nTotal\n1,599\n15\n281\nFigures may not add up due to rounding. Please see the 'Notes' section at the end of this press release for important disclosures relating to the CPR.\nPierre Eliet, Executive Director and Country Chair Malaysia,\ncommented:\n\"We are very pleased to announce the results of our CPR which provide an independent validation of our significant resource base. The report confirms our view of the high-quality nature of Seascape's Malaysian portfolio, giving investors exposure to both hard value and significant exploration upside.\nIn addition to the substantial Tembakau discovery, the report highlights the large, low-risk exploration potential of the Mid-Miocene 'channel' play present across the Temaris block. Prospects on the block, such as Allamanda and Keladi, have the potential to transform Temaris into a new 'gas hub' in Peninsular Malaysia to satisfy growing energy demands.\nSeascape's momentum will continue into the second half of 2025 as we move Temaris forward and begin the search for a long-term partner on the block. Additionally, we also anticipate a firm well decision on Block 2A while also actively seeking growth opportunities in Malaysia and across the Southeast Asian region.\"\nTemaris Cluster (100%\nPI,\noperated)\nSeascape was awarded a 100%\nparticipating interest and\noperatorship in Temaris in the current Malaysia Bid Round\n2025. The acreage includes two gas discoveries in shallow water (~70 metres) offshore Peninsular Malaysia on the western flank of the Malay basin and covers an area of around 1,200 km2.\nThe main discovery,\nTembakau\n, was originally made in 2012 and appraised in 2014 and benefits from an extensive dataset including full 3D seismic coverage, well logs, DSTs and extensive well core. Tembakau is located near to infrastructure with the closest producing gas field ~50 km away from the field.\nThe Tembakau field comprises Early-Mid Miocene channel sandstone reservoirs which are clearly imaged on 3D seismic and exhibit a strong amplitude response. The field has excellent reservoir properties with porosities of 20% to 35% and permeabilities of over one Darcy and contains dry gas with very low levels of impurities. The Tembakau-2 well was tested and produced from the I-10 and I-20 reservoirs, with both reservoirs flowing at gas rates of 16 mmscfd, constrained by the well test equipment used.\nThe smaller\nMengkuang\ndiscovery is located 30 km to the northeast of Tembakau in high-quality mid-Miocene sandstones and also demonstrates strong seismic amplitude response. The field is split into several lobes and benefits from a good dataset but was not tested at the time of\ndiscovery.\nTemaris Net 2C Contingent Resources\nField(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nLiquids\n(mmbbl)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nTemba",

Bhd., has been awarded a 100% participating interest as operator in a Small Field Asset Production Sharing Contract (\"SFA PSC\") over the Temaris Cluster (\"Temaris\" or the \"Award\") offshore Peninsular Malaysia.\nThe Award was made under the Malaysia Bid Round 2025 (\"MBR 2025\") launched in February 2025 by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) via Malaysia Petroleum Management (\"MPM\") the oil & gas industry regulator in Malaysia.\nThe Award of Seascape's first development operatorship represents a material step forward for the Company in expanding the scale and scope of its business, further building on its success in Malaysia and delivering on its ambition to materially expand the Company's portfolio in 2025.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nLocated in shallow-water, Peninsular Malaysia\n\u00b7\nComprised of two gas discoveries; Tembakau and Mengkuang\n\u00b7\n100% working interest, first Seascape-operated development\n\u00b7\nTemaris awarded under Small Field Asset terms\n\u00b7\nInitial work indicates Temaris could contain >250 bcf (~42 mmboe) of discovered resources\n\u00b7\nIn addition, significant exploration upside on-block and in surrounding open acreage\n\u00b7\nTargeting a low-cost development plan, FDAP delivery within 18 months\n\u00b7\nWork commitment to be met through cash-on-hand\nBackground\nTemaris is comprised of two gas discoveries in shallow water (~70 metres) offshore Peninsular Malaysia on the western flank of the Malay basin and covers an area of around 1,200 sq km.\nThe main discovery, Tembakau, was originally made in 2012 and appraised in 2014 while the smaller Mengkuang discovery was made in 2015, both by Lundin Malaysia B.V. (now International Petroleum Corporation).\nTembakau is located near to infrastructure and benefits from an extensive dataset including full 3D seismic coverage, well logs, DSTs and extensive well core. Temaris' three main stacked reservoirs comprise of Early-Mid Miocene channel sandstones which are clearly imaged on 3D seismic and which exhibit a strong amplitude response. The field has excellent reservoir properties, contains dry gas with very low levels of impurities and tested at substantial flow rates. The field is located near infrastructure, with the closest producing gas field being located 47 km away from the field.\nMengkuang is located 30 km to the northeast of Tembakau in high quality Miocene sandstones which also demonstrate strong amplitude responses. The field also benefits from a good dataset though was not tested at the time of discovery.\nPrevious public disclosures indicated that the existing discoveries on the Temaris Cluster could contain in excess of 250 bcf (~42 mmboe) of recoverable resources viewed as crucial to boost gas supply to Peninsular Malaysia, which is forecasted to be deficient in the next few years. The continuation of the Tembakau and Mengkuang channel sandstone reservoirs across the Temaris PSC also represents significant exploration upside. Seascape has been using high-end geophysical techniques to identify these channelised targets and is confident additional exploration potential will be matured both within the PSC and across neighbouring open acreage.\nKey Terms\nSimilar to the Company's DEWA Complex Cluster (Seascape, 28%) development asset, the Temaris Cluster development will fall under the Small Field Asset (\"SFA\") terms which are specifically designed to simplify and incentivise rapid development of smaller hydrocarbon accumulations in Malaysia and provide enhanced field economics versus traditional PSCs.\nGiven the shallow water depths and nearby infrastructure, Seascape is targeting a low-cost development plan utilising a normally unmanned platform with minimal processing which could support a potential gross production plateau of up to 100 mmscfd.\nThe key terms of the Award are to deliver a Field Development and Abandonment Plan (\"FDAP\") within 18 months along with certain specialised subsurface studies and 3D seismic reprocessing. The financial commitment under the Award is ~US$2 million and will be met through Seascape's existing cash resources.\nCompetent Persons Report\nGiven the rapid growth in the Company's portfolio since Q4 2024, the Company has commissioned Sproule-ERCE to undertake a CPR to provide an independent assessment of the contingent and prospective resources covering the Temaris Cluster and DEWA Complex Cluster.\nIt is anticipated that the CPR will be completed during the next few months, and the Company will update investo",

Seascape remains focused on keeping costs fit-for-purpose without compromising management's ability to pursue the exciting growth opportunities it sees across the region. Corporate overheads, excluding investments, are anticipated to run at approximately \u00a33 million per year.\nSeascape Outlook\nIn addition to Kertang progressing towards a formal drilling commitment in mid-2025 by the new operator, INPEX CORPORATION, Seascape anticipates DEWA will progress towards a detailed Field Development Plan prior to the end of 2025, expected to unlock between 85-100 bcf (14-17 mmboe) of resources net to the Company and targeting production by 2027. The DEWA cluster (Company 28%) was awarded in October 2024 and consists of 12 gas discoveries in shallow water (40-50 metres) near to infrastructure off the coast of Sarawak, Malaysia.\nNew business activity remains a priority for the Company. So far this year, new licensing rounds have been announced in Malaysia and Thailand covering both discovered resources awaiting development and new exploration acreage, with more likely to follow as host governments strive to keep pace with the forecast growth in regional power demand levels.\nSeascape is actively pursuing growth opportunities through both ground-floor initiatives and potential M&A with an ambition of materially expanding its portfolio during the year.\nNick Ingrassia, CEO of Seascape, commented:\n\"Following our hard work during 2024, Seascape created a platform to pursue the excellent growth opportunities we are seeing in Southeast Asia. Set against a constructive macro backdrop in the region, we are looking forward to an exciting 2025 as we seek to expand our portfolio and continue delivering value for all of our stakeholders.\"\nEnds\nEnquiries:\nSeascape Energy Asia plc\nIR@seascape-energy.com\nJames Menzies (Executive Chairman)\nNick Ingrassia (Chief Executive)\nPierre Eliet (EVP Corporate, Country Chair Malaysia)\nStifel (Nomad and Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7710 7600\nCallum Stewart\nJason Grossman\nAshton Clanfield\nSNELSeascape@Stifel.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald\nPete Lynch\nStandard\nEstimates of reserves and resources have been carried out in accordance with the June 2018 SPE/WPC/AAPG/ SPEE/SEG/SPWLA/EAGE Petroleum Resources Management System (\"PRMS\") as the standard for classification and reporting.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n2 December 2024\nSeascape\nEnergy Asia plc\n(the \"Company\", \"\nSeascape\nEnergy\" or \"\nSeascape\n\")\nPlacing and Subscription\nSeascape\nEnergy, an E&P company focused on Southeast Asia, is pleased to announce a fundraising by way of a direct subscription by certain Directors\n,\nsenior management\nand certain shareholders\n(the \"\nSubscription\n\"),\nand an institutional placing (the \"\nPlacing\n\") of new Ordinary Shares (together, the \"\nFundraising\n\") to follow on from the successful conditional farm-out of a 42.5% participating interest in the Block 2A Production Sharing Contract (the \"\nPSC\n\" or \"\nBlock 2A\n\") to INPEX CORPORATION (\"\nINPEX\n\") (the \"\nBlock 2A farm-out\n\"). The Fundraising raised gross proceeds of \u00a32.0 million (\u00a31.8 million net), through the successful Placing and Subscription of 5,710,810 new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nFundraising Shares\n\"), in each case at an issue price of 35 pence per new Ordinary Share (the \"\nIssue Price\n\").\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (\"\nStifel\n\") is acting as Sole Bookrunner to the Company in connection with the Fundraising.\nBackground to the Fundraising and Use of Proceeds\nFollowing a strategic review of its operations during 2024, the Board and management of\nSeascape\nannounced on 17 June 2024 the Company's exit from Norway and its focus on building a full-cycle E&P business in Southeast Asia, where the supportive attitude of the host governments towards small-and-medium sized E&P companies offers significant growth opportunities to the Company.\nSeascape\nentered Malaysia in the Malaysian Bid Round 2022 by being awarded operatorship of Block 2A, offshore Sarawak. Block 2A was awarded along with high-quality 3D seismic data at nil cost. Following a further acquisition in December 2023 (the Topaz acquisition), the Company's working interest in Block 2A increased to 52.5%.\nBlock 2A contains the giant Kertang prospect, which is believed to be one of the largest undrilled structures in Malaysia. The CPR undertaken by ERCE in June 2024 confirmed the giant scale of the Kertang prospect assigning total gross unrisked mean prospective resources of 9.1 TCF as well as 146 mmbbls of NGLs (1.7 billion boe) (approximately 900 BCF as well as 15 mmbbls, on a net basis) (approximately 165 mmboe) across four target horizons.\nSeascape\ncommenced a farm-out process to identify the right partner for Block 2A and following intense interest from major global energy companies, announced earlier this morning a farm-out agreement with INPEX, Japan's largest\nE&P\ncompany, in return for a cash and carry consideration on the Company's retained interest (10%) in the PSC. Completion of the farm-out is anticipated at the end Q1 2025.\nUnder the terms of the Block 2A farm-out,\nSeascape\nwill receive:\n\u00b7\nAn uncapped carry for\nSeascape's\nretained interest (10%) through the remaining exploration phase including one firm wildcat well and one contingent appraisal well (subject to a commercial discovery);\n\u00b7\nUS$20 million cash consideration including:\no\nUS$10 million payable in full at completion of the Block 2A farmout\n(the \"\nInitial Farmout Consideration\n\"); and\no\nUS$10 million contingent cash consideration to be paid following confirmation of a commercial discovery; and\n\u00b7\nReimbursement of certain historic costs associated with the PSC totalling approximately US$0.5 million.\nIn October 2024,\nSeascape\nannounced the award at nil cost of a 28% participating interest in a small field asset production sharing contract over the DEWA Complex Cluster (the \"\nDEWA PSC\n\", or \"\nDEWA\n\"), off the coast of Sarawak. The DEWA PSC is comprised of 12 shallow water gas fields and discoveries dating from the 1980s, with approximately 500 BCF GIIP\n[1]\non a gross basis (83 mmboe) that were overlooked by previous operators which had been focused on oil production.\nDEWA provides\nSeascape\nwith an immediate portfolio of gas fields, with net estimated resources of approximately 85-100 BCF (14-17 mmboe)\n[2]\n, unlocked by new favourable Small Field Asset fiscal terms, with approximately 50% profit for the contractor (increased from approximately 30% prior to the new fiscal terms).\nGiven the shallow",

MPM acts on behalf of PETRONAS in the overall management of Malaysia's petroleum resources throughout the lifecycle of upstream oil and gas assets.\nNick Ingrassia, CEO of Seascape, commented:\n\"The successful farm-out of Block 2A marks an important turning point for Seascape Energy Asia following its strategic pivot in the middle of 2024. Attracting a high-quality partner into the world-class Kertang prospect, alongside the recent award of 12 gas discoveries in the DEWA PSC, highlights the vital role that nimble, forward thinking, independent E&P companies have to play in the Southeast Asian upstream ecosystem.\n\"The commercial terms of the transaction allow Seascape to retain material exposure to the significant upside associated with drilling the 9 TCF Kertang prospect at nil ongoing cost while also providing capital to be reinvested into the business - including bringing the DEWA cluster through to development.\n\"I am enormously proud of our team which has worked tirelessly over the past few months to deliver a transaction which not only secures Seascape's future - but also creates a platform for growth. We look forward to working with our new partner, INPEX\nCORPORATION\n, along with PETRONAS and Petros to bring the transaction to a successful completion during Q1 2025.\"\nTransaction Details\nSeascape Energy has executed three inter-conditional documents, which have the collective effect of transferring a 42.5% participating interest in the Block 2A to INPEX\nCORPORATION\nin return for a cash and carry consideration on the Company's Retained Interest (10%) in the PSC.\nINPEX\nCORPORATION\nis Japan's largest exploration and production (E&P) company, and is currently involved in projects across multiple continents, including the Ichthys LNG Project in Australia as Operator.

The Award was made under the Malaysia Bid Round Plus (\"MBR+\") by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) (\"PETRONAS\") through Malaysia Petroleum Management.\nThe DEWA partners are EnQuest Petroleum Production Malaysia Ltd (42%, operator) (\"EnQuest\") and Petroleum Sarawak Exploration & Production Sdn. Bhd. (30%) (\"PSEP\").\nDEWA is comprised of 12 gas discoveries in shallow water (40-50 metres) near to infrastructure off the coast of Sarawak and includes; D30, D30W, Danau, Daya, Daya North, D41, D41W, Dafnah West, Dana, Darma, West Acis and Spaoh. Gas was originally found in the area in 1982 but overlooked by previous partnerships which were focused on oil production.\nThe DEWA partnership is anticipated to initially focus on the D30, Danau,\nD41\n, D41W, Dana and Dafnah West discoveries which are estimated by the Company to contain circa 500 bcf GIIP (gross, ~83 mmboe). These fields are broadly characterised as having clastic reservoirs with large gas columns and good hydrocarbon mobilities. There is a significant dataset including 35 well penetrations, well logs, multiple DSTs and MDTs as well as extensive 3D seismic coverage across the entire PSC area.\nGiven the shallow water depths and nearby infrastructure, the partnership is targeting a low-cost development plan utilising normally unmanned platform(s) with minimal processing which could support a potential production plateau of up to 100 mmscfd.\nThe initial low-cost work commitment (approximately $0.6 million net to Seascape) is to conduct a detailed resource assessment and deliver a Field Development and Abandonment Plan within two years. The development of these fields will be under the innovative, new Small Field Asset terms which are specifically designed to simplify and incentivise rapid development of smaller hydrocarbon accumulations in Malaysia.\nInvestor Meet Company\nNick Ingrassia (CEO), James Menzies (Executive Chairman) and Pierre Eliet (EVP Corporate and Country Chair Malaysia) will host a live presentation for investors via Investor Meet Company on 22 October 2024 at 10:00 AM BST.\nThe presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders. Questions can be submitted pre-event via your Investor Meet Company dashboard up until 21 Oct 2024, 09:00 AM BST, or at any time during the live presentation.\nInvestors can sign up for free via:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/seascape-energy-asia-plc/register-investor\nInvestors who follow Seascape Energy on the Investor Meet Company platform will automatically be invited.\nJames Menzies, Executive Chairman of Seascape, commented:\n\"This award supports our recent decision to strategically pivot the business to focus on Southeast Asia. It builds on our existing position in Malaysia and in one step provides Seascape with an immediate portfolio of gas discoveries with over 500 bcf of in-place resources from four main fields with considerable upside.\nDEWA represents an opportunity for the Company together with its partners, EnQuest and Petros, to pursue a low-cost, near-term development located close to existing infrastructure. While the financial commitment and costs over this initial planning phase are expected to be minimal, the prize is very material for Seascape. The award perfectly illustrates how an Independent E&P company can compete and create value in this environment.\nOn behalf of our entire team, I would like express our gratitude to PETRONAS for the award and we look forward to continued collaboration with all of our partners as we seek to grow the Seascape business for the benefit of both our shareholders and our Malaysian stakeholders.\"\nEnds\nEnquiries:\nSeascape Energy Asia plc\ninfo@seascape-energy.com\nNick Ingrassia (Chief Executive)\nStifel (Nomad and Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7710 7600\nCallum Stewart\nJason Grossman\nAshton Clanfield\nSNELLongboatEnergy@Stifel.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited (Joint Broker)\nTel: +44 20 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald\nPete Lynch\nStandard\nEstimates of reserves and resources have been carried out in accordance with the June 2018 SPE/WPC/AAPG/ SPEE/SEG/SPWLA/EAGE Petroleum Resources Management System (\"PRMS\") as the standard for classification and reporting.

We see significantly more potential in Southeast Asia for a small company than Norway and believe the Company's existing positioning and access to opportunities provide excellent value-creation potential.\nRecent structural changes to the Norwegian upstream industry have favoured an increasingly small group of very large companies with long-term investment horizons and access to low cost of capital. This left the Company at a significant competitive disadvantage and, despite enormous efforts and attempts to secure opportunities with shareholder value upside, the Company has been unable to establish a meaningful growth platform in Norway.\nIn contrast, the Company entry into Malaysia last year coincided with a proliferation of opportunities across Southeast Asia and a positive and supportive attitude of the host governments towards small-and-medium sized companies which are now viewed as crucial to maximizing value from their maturing basins. Furthermore, this positive industry sentiment is set against a macro backdrop of growing economies with increasing energy demands, benign operating environments, a structurally lower cost base and an opportunity to help reduce carbon emissions through the development of indigenous gas resources to displace coal fired power generation.\nThe Company has competitive advantages in the region, including an experienced team with excellent long-term relationships and networks established across Southeast Asia.

The two principal trading entities are Return to Scene Limited (\"R2S\") and SE Innovation Limited (\"SEIL\"). R2S and SEIL provide visual asset management software (\"VAMS\") services and packages to a variety of sectors. R2S holds the intellectual property which supports the VAMS, which is the key asset of the Group.\nSeaEnergy also owns 100% of the share capital in Eagle H C Limited, which holds two UK royalty interests in respect of oil and gas exploration fields, and 100% of the share capital in SeaEnergy Hibernia Limited, which holds 18.7% (approximately 30 million shares) of Lansdowne Oil & Gas plc (\"Lansdowne\"). Trading in the shares of Lansdowne is currently suspended.\nSeaEnergy began to experience cash flow challenges in late 2015, due to the ongoing oil price decline adversely impacting R2S activity levels. As seen throughout the industry, client orders were cancelled or postponed, and the number of new business enquiries reduced significantly.\nIn response to these challenges, the SeaEnergy directors secured additional funding in November 2015 via a \u00a31 million working capital loan. In early 2016, trading conditions began to deteriorate even further.\nOn 4 March 2016, SeaEnergy announced that it was facing significant cash flow difficulties and would need to consider a sale of its main assets, or the Group businesses would be unable to continue trading beyond May 2016. In March 2016, the directors began a targeted marketing exercise for the sale of the whole or part of the Group. No viable offers were received at that time.\nOn 26 April 2016, trading in the shares of SeaEnergy were suspended, pending clarification of its financial position.\nKPMG were appointed to run an accelerated sales process on 28 April 2016. A preferred bidder was selected by the Group on 13 May 2016.\nPrior to the appointment of the Joint Administrators, the business, assets and 10 employees of SEIL (including the Return to Scene forensic, and Max & Co businesses) were sold to R2S by the SEIL directors, and seven employees of SeaEnergy were transferred to R2S. Immediately following the appointment, the shares of R2S were acquired by James Fisher Holdings UK Limited. All 33 employees of R2S (including the employees transferred from SEIL and SeaEnergy) were transferred as part of the transaction. With the exception of one individual, all employees are based in Aberdeen.\nOf the remaining seven SeaEnergy employees, three have been made redundant immediately following the appointment and four have been retained to assist the Joint Administrators.\nBlair Nimmo, Joint Administrator and UK Head of Restructuring for KPMG, said:\n\"We are pleased to have concluded the sale of R2S to James Fisher, which will safeguard the majority of jobs within the Group, maintain customer service, and provide the best outcome for SeaEnergy's creditors. Based on the information available at present, it is unlikely there will be any recovery for the shareholders.\n\"We are now focused on realising the remaining assets and investments held by SeaEnergy, and would encourage any party with an interest in acquiring all, or parts, of these investments to make contact with us as soon as possible.\"\nResignation of Nominated Adviser and Broker\nWH Ireland Limited has today resigned as nominated adviser and broker to SeaEnergy with immediate effect. If SeaEnergy fails to appoint a replacement nominated adviser within one month from today, the admission of its AIM securities will be cancelled.\nEnds\nMedia enquiries:\nPhil Addicott / Neil McSeveny\n0141 333 9585\n07824 666 956 / 07854670520\nPhil.addicott@bigpartnership.co.uk\n/\nneil.mcseveny@bigpartnership.co.uk\nAbout KPMG:\nKPMG LLP, a UK limited liability partnership, operates from 22 offices across the UK with approximately 12,000 partners and staff.

The Company has now selected a preferred bidder and entered into an exclusivity agreement with this party (the \"Preferred Bidder\"). Under the agreement, the Preferred Bidder has made a non-refundable payment which will help to fund the Group though May.\nThe Preferred Bidder has indicated that it intends to acquire all aspects of the R2S business and it is planned for the disposal to be completed within a short timeframe.\nHowever, there can be no guarantee that the Potential Disposal will be completed. The Directors anticipate that the proceeds of the Potential Disposal, if received, would be sufficient to repay the bank overdraft, nearly all of the Group's secured debt and a proportion of amounts owing to unsecured creditors.\nThe Group has other assets, including an 18.67% interest in\nLansdowne Oil & Gas plc (the shares of which are currently suspended from trading) and two UK royalty interests.

Since that announcement, SeaEnergy has been in detailed discussions with a number of potential purchasers for the Return to Scene business (\"R2S\"), several of which are still ongoing (the \"Potential Disposal\").\nThe Potential Disposal would be classified as a fundamental change of business under the AIM Rules for Companies and therefore require the prior approval of shareholders at a specially convened general meeting. The Directors are of the opinion that it is now unlikely that a sale and purchase agreement can be agreed and executed in sufficient time to allow the process of shareholder approval to occur while the Company remains solvent. In addition, the suspension in trading of the shares of Lansdowne Oil & Gas\nplc, a company in which SeaEnergy holds an 18.67% interest, on 13 April 2016 means that it is unlikely that the Company could currently raise funds through the disposal of its interest.\nThe Directors are therefore taking advice from insolvency practitioners.\nAs a result, the Company has requested a suspension in trading of the Company's shares pending clarification of the financial position.\nFurther announcements will be made as appropriate.\nENDS\nJohn Aldersey-Williams\nChief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 1224 748480\nClaire Fleming\nCorporate Communications & Research Manager\nTel: +44 7880 358920\nTim Feather/Liam Gribben\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nWH Ireland Limited\nTel: 0113 394 6600\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nMSCMMGZDZVGGVZM",

Providence, in defence of its position, counterclaimed against Transocean. The Hon. Mr Justice Popplewell, in his judgment of 19 December 2014 in the Commercial Court in London, found that Transocean was in breach of contract for failing to maintain various parts of its sub-sea equipment and that Transocean was not, therefore, entitled to certain amounts reflecting Transocean's own day rate remuneration.\n'As previously disclosed, Transocean sought and was granted the right to appeal one aspect of Mr Justice Popplewell's judgment, which specifically related to whether Providence was entitled to set off certain spread costs against Transocean's claim. The appeal of this aspect of the judgment turned on\nthe\nCourt of Appeal's\ninterpretation of the\nwording of\nthe consequential loss\nclause in the rig contract (Mr. Justice Popplewell had found\nthat\nProvidence was entitled to set off certain spread costs).\nThe appeal was heard in March 2016\n.\n'In a judgment handed down today, 13 April 2016, the Court of Appeal has granted Transocean's appeal on the set off point. All other aspects of Mr Justice Popplewell's judgment remain in force, including the finding that Transocean was in breach of contract.\n'Providence estimates the financial implications of the Court of Appeal's judgment will result in the payment of approximately US$7 million (excluding interest and costs) to Transocean. The parties and their legal advisors are currently in the process of agreeing the final amount payable to Transocean (together with any costs and interest thereon) and the terms of payment. Accordingly, at this time the Company cannot confirm the final amount payable to Transocean, nor the terms or timing of such payment.'\n\"Lansdowne, through its 20% interest in the Barryroe Field, will need to raise capital to meet any liabilities arising from the court ruling and for its on-going working capital requirements. As a result, the Company has requested the continued suspension of its shares from trading on AIM pending clarification of the Company's financial position. In the meantime, the Company is in active discussions with its financial advisors and current debt provider with the objective of ensuring that the Company has the appropriate financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the Barryroe Joint Venture Agreement and meet its on-going working capital requirements.\n\"On the basis of this issued judgment, Lansdowne will now make a provision for its net amount in its Financial Accounts for the year ending 31 December 2015.\n\"Further updates will be issued in due course.\"\nFor further information contact:\nSteven Bertram\nFinance and Commercial Director\nTel: +44 1224 748480\nClaire Fleming\nCorporate Communications & Research Manager\nTel: +44 7880 358920\nTim Feather/Liam Gribben\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nWH Ireland Limited\nTel: 0113 394 6600\nNotes\nAbout SeaEnergy PLC:\nSeaEnergy PLC is an innovation-led offshore energy services business, based in Aberdeen, Scotland\nand listed on the London Stock Exchange's AIM Market.\nR2S Visual Asset Management system (delivered by SeaEnergy subsidiary Return To Scene) provides photographic capture and three dimensional modelling of oil & gas installations, linking these images to asset management databases for major international oil operators, allowing them to improve the performance of their assets whilst providing operational efficiencies.\nR2S Forensic is an interactive software system that enhances planning, investigation and collaboration through the power of visual imagery.

Progress towards Group profitability was good until the significant decline in the oil price which commenced in late 2014. This resulted in the deferral or cancellation of many projects by our oil company customer base.\nSigns of improvement in the market were evident through discussions with our customers in late 2015 as their budgets were finalised for 2016. However, trading conditions within the oil and gas industry have deteriorated further since the start of the year and a number of projects which were expected to be undertaken in the early part of 2016 have been deferred to later in the year or beyond.\nDespite significant cost reductions and the exit from Marine and Ship Management activities, the Group is generating losses at current activity levels. The loan facilities announced in November 2015, which were intended to bridge the gap to improved trading conditions, have proved to be insufficient and the Company's cash position is becoming constrained.\nThe Board believes that the longer term prospects for R2S software and services remain positive, but any short term improvement in performance would require a rapid upturn in the oil and gas market. Given the uncertainty over the timing of such an upturn and the current working capital position, the Board is in discussions with a number of parties who have expressed an interest in the acquisition of the R2S Visual Asset Management business and/or other assets of the Group. If agreed, such a disposal would be likely to be classified as a fundamental change of business under the AIM Rules for Companies and require the approval of shareholders.\nThere can be no certainty that such a disposal will be completed and, if not, the Group is expected to require additional funding to be able to continue to trade beyond May 2016.\nFurther announcements will be made as appropriate.\nENDS\nJohn Aldersey-Williams\nChief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 1224 748480\nClaire Fleming\nCorporate Communications & Research Manager\nTel: +44 7880 358920\nTim Feather/Liam Gribben\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nWH Ireland Limited\nTel: 0113 394 6600\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nMSCKMGGFGFVGVZZ",

          "full_content": "25 Nov 2015 07:05\nRNS Number : 8597G\nSeaEnergy PLC\n25 November 2015\nSeaEnergy PLC\n(\"SeaEnergy\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nTrading and Working Capital Funding Update\nSeaEnergy, the innovation-led offshore energy services business, is pleased to announce that it has agreed a working capital funding package under which it can draw up to \u00a31.0 million over the next 12 months.\nDuring 2015, sustained low oil prices have very severely impacted levels of business in the core R2S offering as well as in other parts of the Group. Revenue from continuing business for the year ending 31 December 2015 is now expected to be between \u00a32.6 and \u00a32.8 million, resulting in a significant loss. While software licence income has held up well and forensic activities are ahead of forecast, the weakness in the oil price and consequent reduction in oil company operating budgets have severely impacted new capture and recapture activities and levels of digital media work.\nIn addition, SeaEnergy has now handed over operational responsibility for the ships previously under management and expects to have completed its exit from ship management by the end of the year.\nThe Directors of SeaEnergy anticipate a recovery in the core R2S business into 2016, as offshore field operators' activity levels pick up, and efforts to grow the business through internationalisation and diversification start to bear fruit. In the UK, the Group has recently won a number of R2S capture projects with total value of around \u00a3150,000 and the Directors have been pleased that R2S licence renewals have continued despite the operational downturn. This further demonstrates the value of the R2S software/service in driving down overall supply chain costs. The Group will make further announcements on new work in due course.\nThe Board has reviewed a number of options to address a shortfall in working capital resulting from the reduced R2S business levels. The options included an equity fundraising, but the Board has opted for a short term debt-based approach in order to minimise long term dilution to shareholders.\nOn 24 November 2015, the Company signed loan agreements with Davies Newman Property Limited, a Scottish-based company with interests in property and oil & gas, and LC Capital Master Fund, Ltd (together the \"Lenders\") (the \"Agreement(s)\").\nUnder the Agreements, each of the Lenders will provide a secured facility of \u00a3500,000 to the Company (the \"Facilities\") on the same terms.\nThe Facilities will each be repayable on 30 April 2017 and accrue interest at 10% per annum, payable semi-annually. In the event of default, an interest rate of 18% will apply to the outstanding balance and the facility will become repayable immediately. In addition the Lenders will each receive warrants to subscribe for up to 2,500,000 new ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price of 10p per share exercisable at any time within five years of the date of grant (the \"Warrants\").\nLC Capital Master Fund, Ltd, a US-based hedge fund which holds a 7% interest in the share capital of the Company is controlled by Steven Lampe, a non-executive director of SeaEnergy, and is therefore a related party of the Company under Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. Davies Newman Property Limited is not a related party of either the Company or LC Capital Master Fund.\nThe Directors of SeaEnergy (excluding Steven Lampe) consider, having consulted with WH Ireland Limited, the Company's nominated adviser, that the terms of the Agreement with LC Capital Master Fund, Ltd and the terms of grant of the Warrants to LC Capital Master Fund, Ltd are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nThe Directors believe that, in light of the currently anticipated upturn in R2S business and other work in 2016, together with significant cost reductions in central costs (including an extension through 2016 of the voluntary salary waivers by the Directors which began in June 2015), the Facilities, in addition to the existing HSBC overdraft facility, should be sufficient for the Group's working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nENDS\nJohn Aldersey-Williams\nChief Executive Officer\nTel: +44 1224 748 480\nClaire Fleming\nCorporate Communications & Research Manager\nTel: +44 7880 358920\nTim Feather/Liam Gribben\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nWH Ireland Limited\nTel: 0113 394 6600\nThis information is provided by RNS\nThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange\nEND\nMSCQELBLEFFFFBL",

          "content": "Agreed, an acquisition is a double-edged sword, it has to be at the right price and genuinely value accretive (which I believe PM304 would be). I\u2019m less worried about the late-life operations aspect though. At some stage Seascape are going to have to take that jump and bring in people with asset operations experience... Just to get through the partner meetings on DEWA/Temaris etc; a team that\u2019s currently weighted towards geoscience and reservoir engineering just doesn\u2019t cover that gap on its own IMO. Geoscience talk 'maybes' and reservoir engineers talk 'possibly/probably', you need someone in the room that operates assets that will say 'no thats a stupid idea because of X,Y,Z.' As I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019d actually be comfortable with some dilution and/or debt if it meant securing the right asset - i.e. one with clear exploration upside or meaningful brownfield redevelopment potential. I genuinely believe these guys look where other operators don'tt, and that, for me, is their real superpower and the main reason I remain heavily invested here. Equally happy for them to continue hoovering up 2C resources and farming out but at some stage, production needs to be sought to A) increase credibility as a live field operator in other regions and B) provide a steady and dependable cashflow source. Agreed though, this does open us up to volatility with commodity price. Cheers",

Conrad is entitled to recover 75% of its agreed historical costs in the PSC after repayment of the CLA. Overall capital expenditures to bring the field to first gas are estimated to be US$320 million, in line with previous advice1,2.

Given the interest in Temaris, i belive SEA could get around $10m/\u00a37.5m cash on a sizeable farmout. Not withstanding the strong cash level in SEA there's a lower \u00a325m m/cap disconnect to Conrad and circa \u00a325m lower m/cap disconnect to UPL (allowing for cash proportion v UPL). Comparative share price valuation to Conrad = 105p. To UPL 103p. Broker target price is 111p and previously 88p versus 65p now. Also any potential farmout for cash should increase that broker target along with the possibility of additional acreage they are chasing ahead of any news re Kertang.",

In my view, there was no real reason for the drop from the high 80s other than investors anticipating how tough it might be to push above \u00a31 and choosing to lock in gains. When enough people do that, you get exactly this kind of outcome: a company that arguably deserves a much higher market cap trading at a share price that looks oddly low compared with its peers. You see this all the time on AIM. The so-called \u201c\u00a31 barrier\u201d gets treated like some kind of holy grail, even though it\u2019s an artificial psychological threshold. Mcap here should be \u00a31.2+ in anticipation of drilling confirmation, anticipation of new license award, farmoutz anticipation etc. Also worth noting, 2x DRO's are on offer! The Pertamana DRO and The Estuary DRO. Seascape have also brought in 2x additional Geology and Geophysics employees in the last month suggesting they are gearing up for more work. Anyway, by next summer I firmly believe we'll be launching towards \u00a32+",

Sale of their 50% interest in the Tuna development project in Indonesia which has 54 mmboe 2C net. (Total 61.4 mmboe 2P/2C) Sold for $215m cash. Based on above - That's equal to \u00a3161.5m which would represent 30p/share to JSE which has 64 mmboe 2P + 121 mmboe 2C post sale of Sinuphorm with the rest for free (current broker target 68p) While SEA isn't a producer, it currently has 63 mmboe 2C with first gas 24 months away of roughly 5k boepd net at DEWA). Similar share price 255p but a 50% farmout of Temaris could reduce the 2C to 40 mmboe giving a pro-rata of 162p plus what ever farm-in contribution value.

As far as MB is concerned, I don't really care if he's a NED, the geologists and petrophysicists do all the real work and Seascape have a very experienced team in Malaysia.

I've seen on other forums people saying it was \"disasterous\" and that \"they've said nothing will happen for a year\", but I think they have their own agenda. My own opinion is that I would rather a small company like Seascape consolidate these fantastic assets rather than spread (and spend) themselves too thinly. I also think there are some short term catalysts: 1) the clear intention to farm-out Temaris could happen at any time (for cash? production deal elsewhere?); 2) confirmation of Kertang rig and drill date (who knows where that will slot into Inpex's drill program); 3) they have obviously been applying for other acreage As disheartening as it is to see the short-term dip, I still firmly beleive this will be a blip in the baseline of the SP in 2-3 years, so for those patient holders this is a case of just trying not to overthink this and be patient. It's also a great time to top up. We have seen how quickly this jumps with relatively little news.",

          "content": "Agreed Sircadian, Totally obvious there\u2019s an agenda here. This looks at least 30p undervalued in my view, so I\u2019m happy to keep adding small tranches while it\u2019s still this cheap. Still plenty to play out. On Tamari\u2019s, they mentioned on day one after getting the award that companies were already reaching out. Since then, they\u2019ve done a proper deep dive into the geo work and identified some monster prospects with real legs. If there was interest before, this just amplifies it. What this team does best is picking up assets nobody\u2019s paying attention to, stripping them right back, and rebuilding the story. They\u2019ve taken it from around 250 BCF up to 1 TCF potential - that\u2019s no small upgrade. It was also mentioned that the adjacent block comes up for licensing in December (need to double-check that), but the play looks like it could extend right across. Could easily evolve into a hub-scale development beyond 1 TCF if it plays out. Also saw a few comments about the \u201cdrill location decision\u201d being a red flag that would delay things - not really the case. From drill location decision to spud typically takes about 6\u201318 months, mainly depending on regulatory timelines. Malaysia usually takes 3\u20136 months for approvals, while the UK is more like 6\u20139 months. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) can take up to 3 months, but if the EIA is already in place for drilling (Which would be likely since this isn't the first well being drilled), that can shorten things to around 3 months total for approvals. So all in all, my take is we\u2019re looking at late Q3/Q4 next year for drilling as a guess - pretty reasonable. And then DEWA just takes care of itself. I'm expecting to see a block award for the adjacent Temaris block, Farmout, News on drilling, DEWA updates, possible acquisition.... Thats my Hitlist.",

The team are actively adding geoscience staff (going by the recent LinkedIn hires), which to me signals they\u2019re gearing up for more work: preparing for further licence awards and showing Petronas they\u2019ve got the people in place to actually deliver. I\u2019d be very surprised if we don\u2019t see the Permata Cluster awarded, given how relentlessly they\u2019ve chased it. Whether that comes via a JV or not is unclear. This DRO is being talked about as ~50 MMboe recoverable, which would push us over 100 MMboe of 2C. It\u2019s been said many times, but worth repeating: Total paid around $4/boe for their Sapura acquisition, which implies a regional read-across of >$400m for us. I\u2019m not expecting anything like $4/boe any time soon, but $1/boe should be a realistic minimum benchmark given this region has been hotting up in terms of majors re-entering. When Menzies said he wanted a \u201ctrain\u201d of DROs, I think he meant it - and I\u2019m expecting that gravy train to keep rolling into 2026 and beyond. Personally (and I know I repeat this a lot), I think it\u2019s time to move from being a small shop hoovering up 2C resources to a full-cycle E&P. An acquisition would be the logical next step. Petrofac going into administration is awful for those affected, but it does open the door to a fire sale of PM304, an already producing late life field. I\u2019d like to see Seascape seize that kind of opportunity. If they make that leap, I genuinely believe this could be a \u00a3500m+ company just in Malaysia, with further upside if they branch out into other regions.",

However, an acquisition is a very double edged sword .. Menzies has stated a few times they can't find at right price that doesn't dilute what they have. Limited cash would almost certainly mean heavy equity dilution and debt for anything meaningful...also opens company up to short term commodity price volatility at this early stage and  increases risk profile significantly. Would need to be exactly right. So I like their caution. Although it tests the patience .. a train of licences is my favoured approach.. these are very low risk financial/work commitments ...add value,  work up to fdp and farm down .. farm in income starts from 2026 with Dewa ?.. not hard to see how this could start to ramp up quickly by 2027 if another 2 or 3 licences in next 6 months ... then production income from mid/late 2028?

I\u2019m less worried about the late-life operations aspect though. At some stage Seascape are going to have to take that jump and bring in people with asset operations experience... Just to get through the partner meetings on DEWA/Temaris etc; a team that\u2019s currently weighted towards geoscience and reservoir engineering just doesn\u2019t cover that gap on its own IMO. Geoscience talk 'maybes' and reservoir engineers talk 'possibly/probably', you need someone in the room that operates assets that will say 'no thats a stupid idea because of X,Y,Z.' As I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019d actually be comfortable with some dilution and/or debt if it meant securing the right asset - i.e. one with clear exploration upside or meaningful brownfield redevelopment potential. I genuinely believe these guys look where other operators don'tt, and that, for me, is their real superpower and the main reason I remain heavily invested here. Equally happy for them to continue hoovering up 2C resources and farming out but at some stage, production needs to be sought to A) increase credibility as a live field operator in other regions and B) provide a steady and dependable cashflow source. Agreed though, this does open us up to volatility with commodity price. Cheers",

Conrad is entitled to recover 75% of its agreed historical costs in the PSC after repayment of the CLA. Overall capital expenditures to bring the field to first gas are estimated to be US$320 million, in line with previous advice1,2. The CLA provides sufficient funding for WNEL\u2019s portion of development costs, including down payments, contingencies for cost overruns, interest during construction, and working capital. First gas from Mako remains on track for delivery in the 4th quarter of calendar year 2027. ============================= https://yourir.info/resources/3f46e16f9e883e80/announcements/crd.asx/6A1300588/CRD_Company_Presentation_December_2025.pdf In total Conrad have 11 mmboe 2C in Duyung and 38 mmboe 2C  in 4 undeveloped discoveries in Aceh = total 49 mmboe. 193.11m shares in issue currently AUS 69c/34.5p = M/cap \u00a366m today. (4 weeks ago at farmout announncement was 15% higher at 79c/39.5p = \u00a376m M/cap. Had $2.8m USD cash at 30/9/25 pre farmout. I posted on UPL board re latest deal and we know what they have and no discovered resources as of yet. 1612m shares Friday close 3.9p = \u00a362.8m. Today 3.7p = \u00a359.6m. Had \u00a32m cash end June 2025. Seascape 63.13m shares 65p = \u00a341m m/cap. \u00a39m cash end of Oct 2025. 63 mmboe 2C net + 281 mmboe prospective resources. (Fully carried for up to 2 wells on 2A $150m gross subject to commercial discovery which would trigger $10m/\u00a37.5m further payment). Given the interest in Temaris, i belive SEA could get around $10m/\u00a37.5m cash on a sizeable farmout. Not withstanding the strong cash level in SEA there's a lower \u00a325m m/cap disconnect to Conrad and circa \u00a325m lower m/cap disconnect to UPL (allowing for cash proportion v UPL). Comparative share price valuation to Conrad = 105p. To UPL 103p. Broker target price is 111p and previously 88p versus 65p now. Also any potential farmout for cash should increase that broker target along with the possibility of additional acreage they are chasing ahead of any news re Kertang.",

In my view, there was no real reason for the drop from the high 80s other than investors anticipating how tough it might be to push above \u00a31 and choosing to lock in gains. When enough people do that, you get exactly this kind of outcome: a company that arguably deserves a much higher market cap trading at a share price that looks oddly low compared with its peers. You see this all the time on AIM. The so-called \u201c\u00a31 barrier\u201d gets treated like some kind of holy grail, even though it\u2019s an artificial psychological threshold. Mcap here should be \u00a31.2+ in anticipation of drilling confirmation, anticipation of new license award, farmoutz anticipation etc. Also worth noting, 2x DRO's are on offer! The Pertamana DRO and The Estuary DRO. Seascape have also brought in 2x additional Geology and Geophysics employees in the last month suggesting they are gearing up for more work. Anyway, by next summer I firmly believe we'll be launching towards \u00a32+",

It's just interpretation, if something shows all the signs of being a good prospect, there is no guarantee that it actually is. Sounds like MATD found that out the hard way. As far as MB is concerned, I don't really care if he's a NED, the geologists and petrophysicists do all the real work and Seascape have a very experienced team in Malaysia. CEO's and NEDS are just there to take credit when it goes good and take the wrap when it goes bad.",

I've seen on other forums people saying it was \"disasterous\" and that \"they've said nothing will happen for a year\", but I think they have their own agenda. My own opinion is that I would rather a small company like Seascape consolidate these fantastic assets rather than spread (and spend) themselves too thinly. I also think there are some short term catalysts: 1) the clear intention to farm-out Temaris could happen at any time (for cash? production deal elsewhere?); 2) confirmation of Kertang rig and drill date (who knows where that will slot into Inpex's drill program); 3) they have obviously been applying for other acreage As disheartening as it is to see the short-term dip, I still firmly beleive this will be a blip in the baseline of the SP in 2-3 years, so for those patient holders this is a case of just trying not to overthink this and be patient. It's also a great time to top up. We have seen how quickly this jumps with relatively little news.",

          "content": "Agreed Sircadian, Totally obvious there\u2019s an agenda here. This looks at least 30p undervalued in my view, so I\u2019m happy to keep adding small tranches while it\u2019s still this cheap. Still plenty to play out. On Tamari\u2019s, they mentioned on day one after getting the award that companies were already reaching out. Since then, they\u2019ve done a proper deep dive into the geo work and identified some monster prospects with real legs. If there was interest before, this just amplifies it. What this team does best is picking up assets nobody\u2019s paying attention to, stripping them right back, and rebuilding the story. They\u2019ve taken it from around 250 BCF up to 1 TCF potential - that\u2019s no small upgrade. It was also mentioned that the adjacent block comes up for licensing in December (need to double-check that), but the play looks like it could extend right across. Could easily evolve into a hub-scale development beyond 1 TCF if it plays out. Also saw a few comments about the \u201cdrill location decision\u201d being a red flag that would delay things - not really the case. From drill location decision to spud typically takes about 6\u201318 months, mainly depending on regulatory timelines. Malaysia usually takes 3\u20136 months for approvals, while the UK is more like 6\u20139 months. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) can take up to 3 months, but if the EIA is already in place for drilling (Which would be likely since this isn't the first well being drilled), that can shorten things to around 3 months total for approvals. So all in all, my take is we\u2019re looking at late Q3/Q4 next year for drilling as a guess - pretty reasonable. And then DEWA just takes care of itself. I'm expecting to see a block award for the adjacent Temaris block, Farmout, News on drilling, DEWA updates, possible acquisition.... Thats my Hitlist.",

The Competent Persons Report (\"CPR\") now ascribes almost 1 TCF of net mean unrisked Prospective Resources to the Temaris block.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nKeladi prospect upgrade to 423 bcf (+125%) with a 45% GCoS\n\u00b7\nNew Tembakau North prospect (29 bcf, 58% GCoS) identified representing a high impact, low risk, nearfield target which could be drilled from a planned Tembakau field platform\n\u00b7\nGeophysical analysis and amplitude mapping demonstrates the Keladi prospect as being located up-dip and part of the same channel system as the Tembakau gas field\n\u00b7\nTotal Temaris net mean unrisked Prospective Resources of 950 bcf (+38%), illustrating significant running room beyond the Tembakau gas field itself\nAll resources quoted herein are mean unrisked Prospective Resources as defined by PMRS Standard (as detailed below).\nPierre Eliet, Executive Director and Country Chair Malaysia,\ncommented:\n\"The Sproule ERCE independent resource update validates the high quality nature of the Temaris block and our significant resource base. We are particularly encouraged by the Keladi prospect, where mean unrisked Prospective Resources have more than doubled.\nThese results, along with Tembakau, position Temaris to become a transformative gas hub for Peninsular Malaysia's growing energy demand.\"\nThe upgrade at Keladi reflects a period of detailed work by the Seascape subsurface team using updated data and high-end geophysical techniques to extract seismic amplitudes which allow for more accurate mapping of the Miocene channel systems sitting at multiple horizons across the Temaris block to the west of Tembakau in the same channel play.\nThe CPR is an important independent third-party verification of Seascape's resource figures. The report confirms (and in the case of Temaris, upgrades) management's technical view of resources at the time of license application.\nIn addition to the Tembakau field (246 Bcf 2C Contingent Resource) and the two largest prospects (Allemanda, Keladi totaling 830 Bcf mean Prospective Resources), the updated work shows several additional near-field exploration targets totaling over 110 bcf within 5 km of the Tembakau field and accessible from a planned Tembakau platform.\nTemaris Block Prospects: Unrisked Net Mean Prospective Resources\nProspect(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nGCoS%\nKeladi\n423\n70\n45%\nAllamanda\n406\n68\n30%\nKangkung *\n66\n11\n38%\nTembakau North *\n29\n5\n58%\nTerung\n*\n23\n4\n50%\nMengkuang South\n4\n1\n65%\nTotal\n950\n158\nSource: Sproule\nERCE, numbers may not add up due to rounding.\n*\nAccessible from the planned Tembakau field platforms\nEnds\nEnquiries:\nSeascape Energy Asia\nplc\nIR@seascape-energy.com\nJames Menzies (Executive Chairman)\nNick Ingrassia (Chief Executive)\nPierre Eliet (Executive Director)\nStifel\n(Nomad\nand\nJoint\nBroker)\nTel: +44 20 7710\n7600\nCallum Stewart\nJason\nGrossman\nAshton\nClanfield\nSNELSeascape@Stifel.com\nCavendish\nCapital\nMarkets\nLimited\n(Joint\nBroker)\nTel: +44 20 7397\n8900\nNeil\nMcDonald\nPete\nLynch\nStandard\nEstimates of reserves and resources have been carried out in accordance with the June 2018 SPE/WPC/AAPG/ SPEE/SEG/SPWLA/EAGE Petroleum Resources Management System (\"PRMS\") as the standard for classification and reporting.

I\u2019d suspect these guys will be able to double reserve numbers if the track record continues. I also feel, for a company that loves to update investors regularly, they have been oddly quiet. Maybe just nothing more to say at the minute, or something up their sleeve. Either way 2026 is looking pretty densely populated for growth catalysts.",

Sale of their 50% interest in the Tuna development project in Indonesia which has 54 mmboe 2C net. (Total 61.4 mmboe 2P/2C) Sold for $215m cash. Based on above - That's equal to \u00a3161.5m which would represent 30p/share to JSE which has 64 mmboe 2P + 121 mmboe 2C post sale of Sinuphorm with the rest for free (current broker target 68p) While SEA isn't a producer, it currently has 63 mmboe 2C with first gas 24 months away of roughly 5k boepd net at DEWA). Similar share price 255p but a 50% farmout of Temaris could reduce the 2C to 40 mmboe giving a pro-rata of 162p plus what ever farm-in contribution value.

In my view, there was no real reason for the drop from the high 80s other than investors anticipating how tough it might be to push above \u00a31 and choosing to lock in gains. When enough people do that, you get exactly this kind of outcome: a company that arguably deserves a much higher market cap trading at a share price that looks oddly low compared with its peers. You see this all the time on AIM. The so-called \u201c\u00a31 barrier\u201d gets treated like some kind of holy grail, even though it\u2019s an artificial psychological threshold. Mcap here should be \u00a31.2+ in anticipation of drilling confirmation, anticipation of new license award, farmoutz anticipation etc. Also worth noting, 2x DRO's are on offer! The Pertamana DRO and The Estuary DRO. Seascape have also brought in 2x additional Geology and Geophysics employees in the last month suggesting they are gearing up for more work. Anyway, by next summer I firmly believe we'll be launching towards \u00a32+",

          "content": "Looks like we missed Seascapes registration of a Singapore vehicle. If you look at the registries, it\u2019s looks to me like they are building a bridge to Indonesia. While the market was focused on new awards in Malaysia, the team quietly established a new regional vehicle. Entity: SEASCAPE ENERGY PTE. LTD. Incorporated: Nov 2025 Why it matters: You don\u2019t set up a Singapore Pte Ltd to run Malaysian operations (they already have multiple Sdn Bhd entities in KL for that). In the E&P world, Singapore is the gold-standard jurisdiction for holding Indonesian PSCs due to the favorable tax treaties and legal protections. This registration perfectly matches the timeline of Indonesia\u2019s massive 75-block bid round. The \"Indonesian Specialist\" Board Hire On January 12, 2026, the board added Michael (Mike) Buck. The Resume: Mike was the COO of Salamander Energy, where he grew production to 14,000 boepd specifically through discoveries in Indonesia and Thailand. He is also currently a director of Sunsteppe Renewable Energy Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. I feel he's an operational hire meant to navigate the Jakarta/Singapore corporate corridor. Given the timing of the Indonesian Bid Rounds: The Indonesian Ministry of Energy (ESDM) launched its 75-block \"backbone\" program in December 2025. Bidding for several key rounds is currently active/closing in February 2026. https://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesia-opens-75-oil-blocks-to-investors-february-tender-set.",

The Upstream article on 31/1/26 \"..has recieved a major boost in a bid to secure a farm-in partner for its Temaris Cluster Project after resources were more than doubled at one gas prospect and another prospect identified\". \"Upstream reported in November that the operator which has currently  100% WI was seeking a co-venturer for exploration drilling and a proposed low cost development to exploit the Tembakau and MengKuang dry gas fields\". The 1200km2 Temaris block is reported as entirely covered by 3D seismic While different to the 2A farmout, there's the benefit of 3D, nearby infrastructure, flow tested wells and immediate bookable reserves once development sanctioned and early production.  Any nearby discoveries would be easily developed to the same infrastructure hub which has to be very attractive.. A big bonus to the value of the farmout could be the award of adjacent acreage and what could potentially be on it.",

All UK north sea with substantial tax credits. They also bought out JapexUK with 7 mmboe 2P for around $190m earlier in 2025. A \u00a33b market cap company and dividends for 2025 maintained are $500m for the year. Focussed on international expansion via M&A to build scale and global diversification and in the Q3 25 results mention material fire power with available liquidity of $1.7 billion so i wonder like UKs Enquest, would they partner in a block with us (much bigger than DEWA) ? \"20/8/25  \"The Group continues to maintain an active but patient pursuit of M&A opportunities both in the UKCS and globally, in line with its focused international expansion strategy, as set out at the Capital Markets Day earlier this year\". If you recall the Seascape presentations ie significant barrier to entry in Malaysia. Seascapes upgrade of Temaris to a 1 TCF play with chances of GOCS up to 68% is material on top of the 43 mmboe 2C there and a 17-18k boepd development project with proved wells -  Also at a time when they're hoping to secure some adjacent acreage while highlighting their strong relationship with the govt (not to mention their ability to separately secure a top industry partner to drill 2A. SEA have 28% of DEWA as we know and a net 5k boepd project with 18 mmboe 2C. And 2A running for free. Opportunity set was described as compelling with SEA in a unique position. A lot of the SEA refocus and announcements came after one of the most highly experienced industry professionals was appointed here - 'GM' (handled billion dollar transactions/Cove sale etc, major farm out deals/valuations on an international scale). It went basically unnoticed at ITH bbs, but  GM was appointed there in the same capacity starting 1/10/25. Her record is obviously very compelling to have her on board re their global plans. From whoever, I'd hope that a Temaris farm in could bring us $10m. That's only 50c per flow tested 2C boe with significant resource upside and a very cheap foothold in a compelling region that is resource hungry and to significantly decouple from coal usage). Whether ITH see us as interesting who knows, but someone will. Wasn't SEA supposedly inundated with farm out approaches at the outset long before the massive upgrade in resource potential.  It must be more attractive now than ever.   'Geraldine has over 35 years of energy investment banking and M&A advisory experience, currently holding the position of independent non-executive director at Seascape Energy, an AIM listed Southeast Asian E&P business, Yaniv Friedman, Executive Chairman commented: \"I'm delighted to welcome Geraldine to the Ithaca Energy Board. Her deep expertise in finance and M&A will be a tremendous asset as we continue to drive our growth strategy. The Board and I are looking forward to working with her.\"",

I\u2019d suspect these guys will be able to double reserve numbers if the track record continues. I also feel, for a company that loves to update investors regularly, they have been oddly quiet.

Sale of their 50% interest in the Tuna development project in Indonesia which has 54 mmboe 2C net. (Total 61.4 mmboe 2P/2C) Sold for $215m cash. Based on above - That's equal to \u00a3161.5m which would represent 30p/share to JSE which has 64 mmboe 2P + 121 mmboe 2C post sale of Sinuphorm with the rest for free (current broker target 68p) While SEA isn't a producer, it currently has 63 mmboe 2C with first gas 24 months away of roughly 5k boepd net at DEWA). Similar share price 255p but a 50% farmout of Temaris could reduce the 2C to 40 mmboe giving a pro-rata of 162p plus what ever farm-in contribution value.

In my view, there was no real reason for the drop from the high 80s other than investors anticipating how tough it might be to push above \u00a31 and choosing to lock in gains. When enough people do that, you get exactly this kind of outcome: a company that arguably deserves a much higher market cap trading at a share price that looks oddly low compared with its peers. You see this all the time on AIM. The so-called \u201c\u00a31 barrier\u201d gets treated like some kind of holy grail, even though it\u2019s an artificial psychological threshold. Mcap here should be \u00a31.2+ in anticipation of drilling confirmation, anticipation of new license award, farmoutz anticipation etc. Also worth noting, 2x DRO's are on offer! The Pertamana DRO and The Estuary DRO. Seascape have also brought in 2x additional Geology and Geophysics employees in the last month suggesting they are gearing up for more work. Anyway, by next summer I firmly believe we'll be launching towards \u00a32+",

While the market was focused on new awards in Malaysia, the team quietly established a new regional vehicle. Entity: SEASCAPE ENERGY PTE. LTD. Incorporated: Nov 2025 Why it matters: You don\u2019t set up a Singapore Pte Ltd to run Malaysian operations (they already have multiple Sdn Bhd entities in KL for that). In the E&P world, Singapore is the gold-standard jurisdiction for holding Indonesian PSCs due to the favorable tax treaties and legal protections. This registration perfectly matches the timeline of Indonesia\u2019s massive 75-block bid round. The \"Indonesian Specialist\" Board Hire On January 12, 2026, the board added Michael (Mike) Buck. The Resume: Mike was the COO of Salamander Energy, where he grew production to 14,000 boepd specifically through discoveries in Indonesia and Thailand. He is also currently a director of Sunsteppe Renewable Energy Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. I feel he's an operational hire meant to navigate the Jakarta/Singapore corporate corridor. Given the timing of the Indonesian Bid Rounds: The Indonesian Ministry of Energy (ESDM) launched its 75-block \"backbone\" program in December 2025. Bidding for several key rounds is currently active/closing in February 2026. https://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesia-opens-75-oil-blocks-to-investors-february-tender-set.",

The 1200km2 Temaris block is reported as entirely covered by 3D seismic While different to the 2A farmout, there's the benefit of 3D, nearby infrastructure, flow tested wells and immediate bookable reserves once development sanctioned and early production.

A big bonus to the value of the farmout could be the award of adjacent acreage and what could potentially be on it.",

All UK north sea with substantial tax credits. They also bought out JapexUK with 7 mmboe 2P for around $190m earlier in 2025. A \u00a33b market cap company and dividends for 2025 maintained are $500m for the year. Focussed on international expansion via M&A to build scale and global diversification and in the Q3 25 results mention material fire power with available liquidity of $1.7 billion so i wonder like UKs Enquest, would they partner in a block with us (much bigger than DEWA) ? \"20/8/25  \"The Group continues to maintain an active but patient pursuit of M&A opportunities both in the UKCS and globally, in line with its focused international expansion strategy, as set out at the Capital Markets Day earlier this year\". If you recall the Seascape presentations ie significant barrier to entry in Malaysia. Seascapes upgrade of Temaris to a 1 TCF play with chances of GOCS up to 68% is material on top of the 43 mmboe 2C there and a 17-18k boepd development project with proved wells -  Also at a time when they're hoping to secure some adjacent acreage while highlighting their strong relationship with the govt (not to mention their ability to separately secure a top industry partner to drill 2A. SEA have 28% of DEWA as we know and a net 5k boepd project with 18 mmboe 2C. And 2A running for free. Opportunity set was described as compelling with SEA in a unique position. A lot of the SEA refocus and announcements came after one of the most highly experienced industry professionals was appointed here - 'GM' (handled billion dollar transactions/Cove sale etc, major farm out deals/valuations on an international scale). It went basically unnoticed at ITH bbs, but  GM was appointed there in the same capacity starting 1/10/25. Her record is obviously very compelling to have her on board re their global plans. From whoever, I'd hope that a Temaris farm in could bring us $10m. That's only 50c per flow tested 2C boe with significant resource upside and a very cheap foothold in a compelling region that is resource hungry and to significantly decouple from coal usage). Whether ITH see us as interesting who knows, but someone will. Wasn't SEA supposedly inundated with farm out approaches at the outset long before the massive upgrade in resource potential.  It must be more attractive now than ever.   'Geraldine has over 35 years of energy investment banking and M&A advisory experience, currently holding the position of independent non-executive director at Seascape Energy, an AIM listed Southeast Asian E&P business, Yaniv Friedman, Executive Chairman commented: \"I'm delighted to welcome Geraldine to the Ithaca Energy Board. Her deep expertise in finance and M&A will be a tremendous asset as we continue to drive our growth strategy. The Board and I are looking forward to working with her.\"",

Sale of their 50% interest in the Tuna development project in Indonesia which has 54 mmboe 2C net. (Total 61.4 mmboe 2P/2C) Sold for $215m cash. Based on above - That's equal to \u00a3161.5m which would represent 30p/share to JSE which has 64 mmboe 2P + 121 mmboe 2C post sale of Sinuphorm with the rest for free (current broker target 68p) While SEA isn't a producer, it currently has 63 mmboe 2C with first gas 24 months away of roughly 5k boepd net at DEWA). Similar share price 255p but a 50% farmout of Temaris could reduce the 2C to 40 mmboe giving a pro-rata of 162p plus what ever farm-in contribution value.

In my view, there was no real reason for the drop from the high 80s other than investors anticipating how tough it might be to push above \u00a31 and choosing to lock in gains. When enough people do that, you get exactly this kind of outcome: a company that arguably deserves a much higher market cap trading at a share price that looks oddly low compared with its peers. You see this all the time on AIM. The so-called \u201c\u00a31 barrier\u201d gets treated like some kind of holy grail, even though it\u2019s an artificial psychological threshold. Mcap here should be \u00a31.2+ in anticipation of drilling confirmation, anticipation of new license award, farmoutz anticipation etc. Also worth noting, 2x DRO's are on offer! The Pertamana DRO and The Estuary DRO. Seascape have also brought in 2x additional Geology and Geophysics employees in the last month suggesting they are gearing up for more work. Anyway, by next summer I firmly believe we'll be launching towards \u00a32+",

Not that I really know, or care for that matter, but exploration isn't science. It's just interpretation, if something shows all the signs of being a good prospect, there is no guarantee that it actually is. Sounds like MATD found that out the hard way. As far as MB is concerned, I don't really care if he's a NED, the geologists and petrophysicists do all the real work and Seascape have a very experienced team in Malaysia. CEO's and NEDS are just there to take credit when it goes good and take the wrap when it goes bad.",

It's just a waiting game really. What I am pleased to see is that the DRO train on offer doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. The last DRO round only had 3 on offer with the MBR+ offering up one additional resource base. This round now has an additional six on offer. If Seascape can continue with the progress they are making in Malaysia, then I would suspect they would be scooping up a few more. Most interestingly, got to page 9 of the temaris award and then look at the Teratai award. Given I've already jumped to conclusions on Indonesia I'm hesitant to do that again.... but the Teratai DRO (specifically the Sotang field) has infrastructure already in place and is detailed as the closest export route option for Temaris. I suspect they will be going all in for that one. Wonder if they will acquire Teratai for the late life production but also the infrastructure for Termaris.",

While the market was focused on new awards in Malaysia, the team quietly established a new regional vehicle. Entity: SEASCAPE ENERGY PTE. LTD. Incorporated: Nov 2025 Why it matters: You don\u2019t set up a Singapore Pte Ltd to run Malaysian operations (they already have multiple Sdn Bhd entities in KL for that). In the E&P world, Singapore is the gold-standard jurisdiction for holding Indonesian PSCs due to the favorable tax treaties and legal protections. This registration perfectly matches the timeline of Indonesia\u2019s massive 75-block bid round. The \"Indonesian Specialist\" Board Hire On January 12, 2026, the board added Michael (Mike) Buck. The Resume: Mike was the COO of Salamander Energy, where he grew production to 14,000 boepd specifically through discoveries in Indonesia and Thailand. He is also currently a director of Sunsteppe Renewable Energy Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. I feel he's an operational hire meant to navigate the Jakarta/Singapore corporate corridor.

The Upstream article on 31/1/26 \"..has recieved a major boost in a bid to secure a farm-in partner for its Temaris Cluster Project after resources were more than doubled at one gas prospect and another prospect identified\". \"Upstream reported in November that the operator which has currently  100% WI was seeking a co-venturer for exploration drilling and a proposed low cost development to exploit the Tembakau and MengKuang dry gas fields\". The 1200km2 Temaris block is reported as entirely covered by 3D seismic While different to the 2A farmout, there's the benefit of 3D, nearby infrastructure, flow tested wells and immediate bookable reserves once development sanctioned and early production.

All UK north sea with substantial tax credits. They also bought out JapexUK with 7 mmboe 2P for around $190m earlier in 2025. A \u00a33b market cap company and dividends for 2025 maintained are $500m for the year. Focussed on international expansion via M&A to build scale and global diversification and in the Q3 25 results mention material fire power with available liquidity of $1.7 billion so i wonder like UKs Enquest, would they partner in a block with us (much bigger than DEWA) ? \"20/8/25  \"The Group continues to maintain an active but patient pursuit of M&A opportunities both in the UKCS and globally, in line with its focused international expansion strategy, as set out at the Capital Markets Day earlier this year\". If you recall the Seascape presentations ie significant barrier to entry in Malaysia. Seascapes upgrade of Temaris to a 1 TCF play with chances of GOCS up to 68% is material on top of the 43 mmboe 2C there and a 17-18k boepd development project with proved wells -  Also at a time when they're hoping to secure some adjacent acreage while highlighting their strong relationship with the govt (not to mention their ability to separately secure a top industry partner to drill 2A. SEA have 28% of DEWA as we know and a net 5k boepd project with 18 mmboe 2C. And 2A running for free. Opportunity set was described as compelling with SEA in a unique position. A lot of the SEA refocus and announcements came after one of the most highly experienced industry professionals was appointed here - 'GM' (handled billion dollar transactions/Cove sale etc, major farm out deals/valuations on an international scale). It went basically unnoticed at ITH bbs, but  GM was appointed there in the same capacity starting 1/10/25. Her record is obviously very compelling to have her on board re their global plans. From whoever, I'd hope that a Temaris farm in could bring us $10m. That's only 50c per flow tested 2C boe with significant resource upside and a very cheap foothold in a compelling region that is resource hungry and to significantly decouple from coal usage). Whether ITH see us as interesting who knows, but someone will. Wasn't SEA supposedly inundated with farm out approaches at the outset long before the massive upgrade in resource potential.  It must be more attractive now than ever.   'Geraldine has over 35 years of energy investment banking and M&A advisory experience, currently holding the position of independent non-executive director at Seascape Energy, an AIM listed Southeast Asian E&P business, Yaniv Friedman, Executive Chairman commented: \"I'm delighted to welcome Geraldine to the Ithaca Energy Board. Her deep expertise in finance and M&A will be a tremendous asset as we continue to drive our growth strategy. The Board and I are looking forward to working with her.\"",

I\u2019d suspect these guys will be able to double reserve numbers if the track record continues. I also feel, for a company that loves to update investors regularly, they have been oddly quiet. Maybe just nothing more to say at the minute, or something up their sleeve. Either way 2026 is looking pretty densely populated for growth catalysts.",

Sale of their 50% interest in the Tuna development project in Indonesia which has 54 mmboe 2C net. (Total 61.4 mmboe 2P/2C) Sold for $215m cash. Based on above - That's equal to \u00a3161.5m which would represent 30p/share to JSE which has 64 mmboe 2P + 121 mmboe 2C post sale of Sinuphorm with the rest for free (current broker target 68p) While SEA isn't a producer, it currently has 63 mmboe 2C with first gas 24 months away of roughly 5k boepd net at DEWA). Similar share price 255p but a 50% farmout of Temaris could reduce the 2C to 40 mmboe giving a pro-rata of 162p plus what ever farm-in contribution value.

In my view, there was no real reason for the drop from the high 80s other than investors anticipating how tough it might be to push above \u00a31 and choosing to lock in gains. When enough people do that, you get exactly this kind of outcome: a company that arguably deserves a much higher market cap trading at a share price that looks oddly low compared with its peers. You see this all the time on AIM. The so-called \u201c\u00a31 barrier\u201d gets treated like some kind of holy grail, even though it\u2019s an artificial psychological threshold. Mcap here should be \u00a31.2+ in anticipation of drilling confirmation, anticipation of new license award, farmoutz anticipation etc. Also worth noting, 2x DRO's are on offer! The Pertamana DRO and The Estuary DRO. Seascape have also brought in 2x additional Geology and Geophysics employees in the last month suggesting they are gearing up for more work. Anyway, by next summer I firmly believe we'll be launching towards \u00a32+",

It's just a waiting game really. What I am pleased to see is that the DRO train on offer doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. The last DRO round only had 3 on offer with the MBR+ offering up one additional resource base. This round now has an additional six on offer. If Seascape can continue with the progress they are making in Malaysia, then I would suspect they would be scooping up a few more. Most interestingly, got to page 9 of the temaris award and then look at the Teratai award. Given I've already jumped to conclusions on Indonesia I'm hesitant to do that again.... but the Teratai DRO (specifically the Sotang field) has infrastructure already in place and is detailed as the closest export route option for Temaris. I suspect they will be going all in for that one. Wonder if they will acquire Teratai for the late life production but also the infrastructure for Termaris.",

While the market was focused on new awards in Malaysia, the team quietly established a new regional vehicle. Entity: SEASCAPE ENERGY PTE. LTD. Incorporated: Nov 2025 Why it matters: You don\u2019t set up a Singapore Pte Ltd to run Malaysian operations (they already have multiple Sdn Bhd entities in KL for that). In the E&P world, Singapore is the gold-standard jurisdiction for holding Indonesian PSCs due to the favorable tax treaties and legal protections. This registration perfectly matches the timeline of Indonesia\u2019s massive 75-block bid round. The \"Indonesian Specialist\" Board Hire On January 12, 2026, the board added Michael (Mike) Buck. The Resume: Mike was the COO of Salamander Energy, where he grew production to 14,000 boepd specifically through discoveries in Indonesia and Thailand. He is also currently a director of Sunsteppe Renewable Energy Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. I feel he's an operational hire meant to navigate the Jakarta/Singapore corporate corridor.

The 1200km2 Temaris block is reported as entirely covered by 3D seismic While different to the 2A farmout, there's the benefit of 3D, nearby infrastructure, flow tested wells and immediate bookable reserves once development sanctioned and early production.  Any nearby discoveries would be easily developed to the same infrastructure hub which has to be very attractive..

A lot of the SEA refocus and announcements came after one of the most highly experienced industry professionals was appointed here - 'GM' (handled billion dollar transactions/Cove sale etc, major farm out deals/valuations on an international scale). It went basically unnoticed at ITH bbs, but  GM was appointed there in the same capacity starting 1/10/25. Her record is obviously very compelling to have her on board re their global plans. From whoever, I'd hope that a Temaris farm in could bring us $10m. That's only 50c per flow tested 2C boe with significant resource upside and a very cheap foothold in a compelling region that is resource hungry and to significantly decouple from coal usage). Whether ITH see us as interesting who knows, but someone will. Wasn't SEA supposedly inundated with farm out approaches at the outset long before the massive upgrade in resource potential.  It must be more attractive now than ever.   'Geraldine has over 35 years of energy investment banking and M&A advisory experience, currently holding the position of independent non-executive director at Seascape Energy, an AIM listed Southeast Asian E&P business, Yaniv Friedman, Executive Chairman commented: \"I'm delighted to welcome Geraldine to the Ithaca Energy Board. Her deep expertise in finance and M&A will be a tremendous asset as we continue to drive our growth strategy. The Board and I are looking forward to working with her.\"",

Whilst SQZ lagged today , it is up from 170p to 203p from the start of the year (19% gain) With regard to Rockhopper - well done - I would have thought you would have followed Navitas and bought into ECO at 7p.

Sale of their 50% interest in the Tuna development project in Indonesia which has 54 mmboe 2C net. (Total 61.4 mmboe 2P/2C) Sold for $215m cash. Based on above - That's equal to \u00a3161.5m which would represent 30p/share to JSE which has 64 mmboe 2P + 121 mmboe 2C post sale of Sinuphorm with the rest for free (current broker target 68p) While SEA isn't a producer, it currently has 63 mmboe 2C with first gas 24 months away of roughly 5k boepd net at DEWA). Similar share price 255p but a 50% farmout of Temaris could reduce the 2C to 40 mmboe giving a pro-rata of 162p plus what ever farm-in contribution value. (plus future development of Temaris and blue-sky upside if Kertang comes in).",

In my view, there was no real reason for the drop from the high 80s other than investors anticipating how tough it might be to push above \u00a31 and choosing to lock in gains. When enough people do that, you get exactly this kind of outcome: a company that arguably deserves a much higher market cap trading at a share price that looks oddly low compared with its peers. You see this all the time on AIM. The so-called \u201c\u00a31 barrier\u201d gets treated like some kind of holy grail, even though it\u2019s an artificial psychological threshold. Mcap here should be \u00a31.2+ in anticipation of drilling confirmation, anticipation of new license award, farmoutz anticipation etc. Also worth noting, 2x DRO's are on offer! The Pertamana DRO and The Estuary DRO. Seascape have also brought in 2x additional Geology and Geophysics employees in the last month suggesting they are gearing up for more work. Anyway, by next summer I firmly believe we'll be launching towards \u00a32+",
