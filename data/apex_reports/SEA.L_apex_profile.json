With a growing middle class, expanding cities, and improving living standards, the region's population is expected to increase steadily over the coming decades. This demographic growth is closely tied to rising energy needs, as more people gain access to electricity, transportation, and modern infrastructure.\nEconomically, Southeast Asia is a powerhouse of growth, driven by manufacturing, trade, and a booming services sector. The region is experiencing robust GDP growth, while regional integration through initiatives such as the ASEAN Economic Community is strengthening cross-border cooperation and investment. This economic expansion is a major driver of rising energy consumption, particularly in industrial and urban areas.\nAs a result, primary energy demand in Southeast Asia is projected to rise sharply through 2050, with the region becoming one of the largest contributors to global energy demand growth. The need for reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy sources is more pressing than ever, particularly as countries aim to balance economic development with environmental sustainability and energy security.\nNatural gas is expected to play a critical role. According to Wood Mackenzie, natural gas could account for up to 30% of the region's primary energy mix by 2050. With demand set to outpace both oil and coal, gas is increasingly seen as a transitional fuel that can support industrial activity, power generation, and emissions reduction. Countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines are investing in gas infrastructure, including pipelines, LNG terminals, and gas-fired power plants, to secure long-term supply and reduce reliance on more carbon-intensive fuels.\nIn this context, Seascape is well-positioned to help meet regional energy demands. The Company has successfully built a portfolio of high-quality, gas-weighted development assets offshore Malaysia-highlighting its ability to generate significant value by leveraging its core technical strengths and regional relationships. As these projects advance toward production, Seascape will also seek to capitalize on its competitive advantages to further expand our portfolio both in Malaysia and across the region.\nOPERATIONS AND ACTIVITY\nContingent and Prospective Resources\nIn August, the Company published details of its Contingent and Prospective Resources from a Competent Person's Report (\"CPR\") commissioned from Sproule ERCE covering the Temaris Cluster (\"Temaris\", 100% operated) and the priority fields in the DEWA Complex Cluster (\"DEWA\", 28%).\nThe CPR is seen as an important independent third-party verification of Seascape's resources figures. The report confirms (and in the case of Temaris, upgrades) management's technical view of resources at the time of license application. Importantly, the CPR highlights new prospective potential in the recently awarded Temaris block.\nThe highlights of the CPR are as follows:\n\u00b7\nTotal net 2C Contingent Resources of 63 mmboe (97% gas), up from nil in past 12 months\n\u00b7\nTotal unrisked net mean Prospective Resources of 281 mmboe (95% gas), an increase of 69% since completion of the Block 2A farm-down in Q1 2025\n\u00b7\nTemaris PSC net 2C Contingent Resources of 276 bcf vs 250 bcf estimated at award\n\u00b7\nAdditional Temaris PSC mean Prospective Resources of 683 bcf\n(114 mmboe)\nlocated in amplitude-supported prospects analogous to the existing discoveries\nNet 2C Contingent Resources\nField(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nLiquids\n(mmbbl)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nTemaris (100%)\n276\n-\n46\nDEWA priority fields (28%)\n94\n2\n18\nTotal\n370\n2\n63\nNet Mean Prospective Resources\nField(s)\nGas\n(bcf)\nLiquids\n(mmbbl)\nTotal\n(mmboe)\nGCoS Range\n(%)\nTemaris (100%)\n683\n-\n114\n30% - 50%\nDEWA priority fields (28%)\n7\n0\n1\n34% - 51%\nBlock 2A (10%)\n908\n15\n166\n16% - 27%\nTotal\n1,598\n15\n281\nTemaris Cluster (100% operated)\nIn June\nSeascape was awarded a 100% operated interest in Temaris in the Malaysia Bid Round 2025. The acreage includes two gas discoveries in shallow water (~70 metres) offshore Peninsular Malaysia on the western flank of the Malay basin and covers an area of around 1,200 km2.\nThe main discovery, Tembakau, was originally made in 2012 and appraised in 2014 and benefits from an extensive dataset including full 3D seismic coverage, well logs, DSTs and extensive well core. Tembakau is located near to infrastructure with the closest producing gas field ~50 km away from the field.\nThe Tembakau field comprises Early-Mid Miocene channel sandstone reservoirs which are clearly imaged on 3D seismic and exhibit a strong amplitude response. The field has excellent reservoir properties with porosities of 20% to 35% and permeabilities of over one Darcy and contains dry gas with very low levels of impurities. The Tembakau-2 well was tested and produced from the I-10 and I-20 reservoirs, with both reservoirs flowing at gas rates of 16 mmscfd, constrained by the well test equipment used.\nThe smaller Mengkuang discovery is located 30 kms to the northeast of Tembakau in high-quality mid-Miocene sandstones and also demonstrates strong seismic amplitude response. The field is split into several lobes and benefits from a good dataset though a DST was not performed at the time of discovery.\nIn addition to the existing Tembakau and Mengkuang discoveries, significant exploration upside exists in the stacked channel sandstone reservoirs which continue across the Temaris PSC. As part of the CPR, Sproule ERCE has also provided Prospective Resources estimates of the four main prospects on the block which are located close to the Tembakau discovery.\nAll prospects exhibit the seismic amplitude characteristics seen at Tembakau and Mengkuang, with Seascape interpreting the largest prospect, Allamanda, to exhibit a particularly robust and extensive amplitude anomaly.\nSeascape anticipates the Temaris PSC prospects to be further derisked following the 3D seismic reprocessing currently underway on the Temaris block.\nDEWA Cluster (28%)\n:\nSeascape was awarded the DEWA Complex Cluster under the Malaysia Bid Round Plus in October 2024 and is comprised of 12 gas discoveries in shallow water (40-50 metres) located off the coast of Sarawak, Malaysia.\nSix fields (D30, Danau, D41, D41W, Dafnah West, Dana) have been prioritised for the initial phases of development (\"DEWA Priority\") and are broadly characterised as having stacked, clastic reservoirs with gas columns up to 110 metres and good hydrocarbon mobilities. The fields benefit from a significant dataset including 35 well penetrations, well logs, multiple DSTs and MDTs and extensive 3D seismic coverage.\nThe Sproule-ERCE review also identified additional upside in-and-around the DEWA Complex for future pursuit. This includes an additional 7 bcf of unrisked net mean Prospective Resources (25 bcf gross) in an undrilled fault block on Dafnah West.\nBlock 2A, offshore Sarawak, Malaysia (10%)\n:\nBlock 2A is located in the North Luconia hydrocarbon province covering approximately 12,000 km2 in water depths between 100 -1,400 metres. Block 2A contains the world-class Kertang prospect, located across four Oligo-Miocene reservoirs, which is a well-defined, large, four-way dip structural high with over 220 km2 of closure and exhibits direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs) including an overlying gas cloud feature and amplitude bright.\nIn March this year, Seascape completed the farm-out of Block 2A to INPEX CORPORATION. In return for cash consideration of US$10 million with the reimbursement of certain historic costs of ~US$1.0 million, the Company assigned a 42.5% interest in Block 2A and retained a fully carried 10% interest through the remaining exploration phase which includes one firm wildcat well and one contingent appraisal well (subject to a commercial discovery). Since the year end, this transaction completed with the Company receiving cash consideration of US$10 million. In the event of commercial discovery, the Company will receive further contingent cash consideration of US$10 million.\nA firm well commitment is expected to be made imminently with the drilling of the Kertang prospect being an important part of INPEX CORPORATION's multi-well, deepwater drilling campaign in Sarawak during 2026/2027.\nSeascape still retains a material exposure to the Kertang prospect with net unrisked mean prospective resources of ~908 bcf and ~15 mmbbl of NGL (~166 mmboe).\nFinancial Results\nAt 30 June 2025 the Group had net cash reserves totalling \u00a38.6 million (1H 2024: \u00a31.3 million) of which \u00a32.0 million is\nrestricted and relates to cash-backed collateralised guarantees provided as security for future work programmes in Malaysia.\nExploration and evaluation assets of \u00a3500k (1H 2024: \u00a3700k) represent capitalised expenditures incurred within Malaysia and are deemed fully recoverable at the balance sheet date.\nAdministrative costs for the period totalled \u00a32.8 million (1H 2024: \u00a33.5 million), of which \u00a30.9 million are considered non-recurring. These non-recurring costs include costs associated with farming down the Malaysian 2A PSC to INPEX, the application of and securing the Temaris PSC, other new venture appraisal costs, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and unrealised foreign exchange losses. When adjusting for these items of non-recurring expenditure, the administrative expenses for the periods are \u00a31.9 million (1H 2024: \u00a32.5 million).\nThe total profit for the period was \u00a35.7 million (1H 2024: loss of \u00a312.5 million) and comprised a loss of \u00a32.5 million (2024: \u00a32.7 million) from continuing operations and a profit of \u00a38.2 million (1H 2024: loss of \u00a39.7 million) from discontinuing operations.\nThe total comprehensive profit for the period included currency translation differences that were taken directly to reserves of \u00a373k (1H 2024: \u00a3800k) and totalled \u00a35.8 million (1H 2024: loss of \u00a313.4 million).\nStatement of going concern\nThe Directors have completed the going concern assessment, taking into account cash flow forecasts up to the end of 2026, sensitivities to those forecasts and stress tests to assess whether the Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group) are a going concern. Having undertaken careful enquiry, the directors are of the view that the Group will not need to access additional funds during the period to meet its current work programme and budget.\nIn the event that the business is presented with opportunities to materially grow its portfolio then it is anticipated that the associated funds will be sourced through asset disposals / farm downs, issuing new equity or a combination of these actions. To the extent that growth opportunities will support debt, this will be considered where appropriate, for example, to support production acquisitions.\nOn behalf of the

Accounting policies\n1.1\nCompany information\nSeascape Energy Asia plc is an AIM public quoted company, limited by shares, incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office is 5th Floor, One New Change, London, EC4M 9AF. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are to responsibly explore, develop, and produce hydrocarbons, particularly gas.\nOn 25 April 2025, the Group invested in its newly incorporated subsidiary, Seascape Energy Asia (One) Sdn. Bhd. at a nominal initial cost of \u00a30.17 (equivalent to MYR 1.00).\n1.2\nAccounting convention\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nThe financial statements are prepared in British pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Group. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest \u00a3.\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.\nSeveral amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2025, but do not have an impact on the interim financial statements of the Group.\n1.3\nGoing concern\nThe Directors have completed the going concern assessment, taking into account cash flow forecasts up to the end of 2026, sensitivities to those forecasts and stress tests to assess whether the Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group) is a going concern. Having undertaken careful enquiry, the directors are of the view that the Group will not need to access additional funds during the period to meet its current work programme and budget.\nIn the event that the business is presented with opportunities to materially grow its portfolio then it is anticipated that the associated funds will be sourced through asset disposals / farm downs, issuing new equity or a combination of these actions. To the extent that growth opportunities will support debt, this will be considered where appropriate for example to support production acquisition.\n1.4\nDiscontinued operations\nIn accordance with IFRS 5 \"Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\" the net results relating to the disposal group are presented within discontinued operations in the Income Statement. Please refer to note 10 for further details.\n2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nIn the application of the Group's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\nThe estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are outlined below.\nShare-based payments\nThe fair value of share-based compensation expense arising from the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Co-investment Plan and the NED Long Term Incentive Plan were estimated using the Black Scholes model and, where appropriate, the average Monte Carlo fair values and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income from the date of grant over the vesting period with a corresponding increase directly in equity. The Monte Carlo model projects and averages the results for a range of potential outcomes for the vesting conditions, the principal assumptions for which the Group using in the estimation of the fair value are the historical 3 years share price volatility and dividend yields. The Black Scholes model is similar to the Monte Carlo model, but is more appropriate for estimating results with a single unknown variable. The Company currently values its share-based payment awards using the Black Scholes model.\nFair value of contingent consideration payable\nEstimate and judgment was applied in fair valuing the contingent consideration payable for the acquisition of SE 2A (previously Topaz Number One Limited) in 2023. Management applied judgement in determining the likelihood of all possible scenarios and this was modelled into a weighted fair value calculation, which was discounted, using an estimated discount rate, to establish the current value of the contingent consideration payable to be recognised. As disclosed in note 20, the contingent consideration was made up of 3 tranches. Tranche 1 was settled in 2023 and tranche 2 was settled in 2025 upon the completion of the farmout of 2A PSC to INPEX. Only tranche 3 remains as contingent on a successful hydrocarbon discovery over a certain volume threshold and therefore subject to ongoing estimation and judgement.\n3. Operating segment\nDuring the period, the Group had two reportable operating segments: Malaysia and Head Office (30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024: Malaysia, Norway and Head Office).

The payment will be equivalent of $1.0 million and will be settled in cash or allotment of shares in the Company, at the discretion of the Company.\nTranche 3 (part 2) is contingent on the growth in the Company's share price. The payment will be equivalent of up to $2.0 million, based on the table shown below, and will be settled in cash or an allotment of shares in the Company at its discretion.\nGrowth in Seascape\nConsideration\nShares Average Price\n%\nUSD\n0-9.9%\n0%\n-\n10-24.9%\n33%\n666,667\n25-49.9%\n67%\n1,133,333\n>=50%\n100%\n2,000,000\nIf a liquidity event occurs, involving the sale of SE 2A's share in the 2A PSC then Tranche 3 will be calculated instead upon the proceeds of the liquidity event, but capped at the total of $3.0 million, as above.\nTo calculate the fair value of the consideration at the time of the acquisition of SE 2A, a base case, low case and liquidity case scenario were risked, weighting and discounted, taking into account the expected chance of a farm down, expected chance of >600bcf discovery and the expected impact on the share price. Also included was the liquidity scenario where the chance of a sale of the interest in the 2A PSC was estimated.\nAt the acquisition date the fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated to be $300k (\u00a3200k). A change of probability of success by 5 percentage points would lead to a 33% change in the fair value consideration of SE 2A, equivalent to USD $100k (\u00a380k). As the plans for the drilling of the exploration well on Block 2A firm up, the Company expects to increase the probability of success and associated contingent liability.\n19.
