The purpose of this Transaction was to arrange all assets of Lamaune and Landore Canada - which are contiguous to one another at Landore's Junior Lake Property - under one corporate entity, as was the case prior to the separation of the assets in 2011. Lamaune is located approximately 235 km northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario, and hosts both the Lamaune Gold prospect and the Lamaune Magnetite Iron Project. Together, Landore's 100%-owned Junior Lake Property and the adjoining Lamaune Iron property comprise a 32,768 -hectare land package.\nThe Transaction was approved by Landore, the sole shareholder of Landore Canada, at a meeting of Lamaune shareholders held on 3 July 2025. Pursuant to the Transaction, public holders of Lamaune's common shares (excluding Landore), will receive CDN$0.0015619791 in cash per share, totalling $95,280.73 in aggregate. In order to receive the cash payable upon the completion of the Transaction, shareholders of Lamaune must complete and sign the letter of transmittal (the \"Letter of Transmittal\") mailed to shareholders. This, along with their share certificate(s) and any other required documents and instruments, must be returned to Computershare Investor Services Inc., in accordance with the procedure set out in the Letter of Transmittal. Non-registered shareholders will receive payment through their intermediary account. Shareholders with queries about this process should contact their intermediary.\nIf shareholders have any questions or require more information with regard to the procedures required for completing the Letter of Transmittal, please contact Computershare Investor Services Inc., the depositary for the Transaction, by telephone at 1-800-564-6253 (North America Toll Free) or 1-514-982-7555 (Outside North America) and by email:\ncorporateactions@computershare.com\n.\nLandore's CEO, Alexander Shaw, commented\n:\n\"\nI am delighted to announce the completion of the amalgamation between Landore Canada and Lamaune, which simplifies the corporate structure of our Canadian subsidiary as majority owners of Lamaune.
