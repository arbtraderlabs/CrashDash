The objective of ore pre-concentration is to reduce the operating costs for producing a copper-gold mineral concentrate from the Racecourse Mineral Resource.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nAn earlier Altrius review (refer to RNS dated 18 June 2024) concluded that Bushranger mineralisation was not amenable to upgrade by the Tomra ore sorting method, but recommended investigation of alternative pre-concentration technologies which could significantly improve project economics.\n\u00b7\nXtract therefore investigated the effectiveness of \"Pre-Screening\", \"Gravity Separation\" and \"Coarse Particle Flotation\" as techniques to pre-concentrate the mineralisation from the Bushranger Mineral Resource.\n\u00b7\nMineralisation from drill holes BRDD21-036, BRDD22-053, BRDD21-022 were combined into two composite samples, with one sample being used for Pre-Screening and Gravity Separation tests, while the second sample was used for the Coarse Particle Flotation (\"CPF\") test work.\n\u00b7\nCPF test work, using the NovaCell\nTM\nKinetic Test Work, showed encouraging results with 78% of the copper mineralisation recovered into only 5% of the mass, with the head grade of the composite sample of 0.19% Cu being upgraded into a pre-concentrate product of 2.8% Cu.\n\u00b7\nNovaCell\nTM\ncoarse particle flotation also recovered 30% more copper than conventional flotation.\n\u00b7\nBy contrast, upgrading of the Racecourse mineralisation\nby pre-screening and simple dense media separation did not achieve positive results, probably due to the disseminated nature of the chalcopyrite within the host rock.\n\u00b7\nIn a further positive development, the Company has been advised that\nEL5574, the main tenement encompassing the Bushranger copper-gold deposits, has been renewed in full for an additional three years until 4 June 2027.\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman said:\n\"The pre-concentrate test work on copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse deposit on the Bushranger Project has shown encouraging results with coarse particle flotation using\nNovaCell\nTM\ntechnology,\ndemonstrating the potential to increase the grade of copper concentrates and recover up to 30% more copper. The\nNovaCell\nTM\nprocess captured 78% of the originally contained copper while rejecting 95% of the original rock mass and this will have significantly positive effects on the costs to process the copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource. As the average grade of the world's overall copper resources continues to fall, ore pre-concentration will become an increasingly important part of the process to allow copper mineral resources to be economically mined and it is pleasing to see that the copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse deposit responds well to ore pre-concentration. We will carry out more detailed test work on the most appropriate methodologies with a low-cost budget and if appropriate introduce the revised technical parameters into the financial model. At current and forecasted copper prices, the project is demonstrating the potential to be one of the next global contributors to the copper deficit. We will keep shareholders informed on the technical and financial results as they progress\"\nOre Pre-Concentration Test Work Program on Mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource\nFrom July 2021 until July 2022, Xtract completed a Phase 2 diamond drilling programme at the Racecourse and Ascot prospects on the Bushranger Project in central New South Wales, Australia.\nFollowing conclusion of the Phase 2 drilling program independent consultants, \"The Measured Group\", based in Brisbane, Australia reported a Mineral Resource of\n512Mt @ 0.22% CuEq, at a cut-off of 0.1% CuEq*, and classified as Inferred and Indicated in accordance with JORC (2012) (refer to RNS 23 November 2022), for the Racecourse Prospect.\n[*CuEq % = (Cu%) + (Au g/t * 0.6577)% + (Ag g/t * 0.008769) %\nCu Price = US$8800/t, Au Price = US$1800/oz, Ag Price = US$24/oz]\nMining studies by Optimal Mining on the Bushranger Gold-Copper Project, completed in 2022 and 2023, concluded that a minimum production rate of 20 Mtpa, and copper price in excess of US$10,000/tonne, are required to generate a positive Net Present Value (\"NPV\") from open pit mining of the Racecourse Mineral Resource (refer to RNS 7 March 2023). To assess the ability of ore pre-concentration to enhance project economics, Xtract contracted Altrius Consulting (\"Altrius\") to undertake a review of the applicability of ore pre-concentration methods to the Racecourse prospect copper-gold mineralisation (refer to RNS 20 July 2023). The Altrius review concluded that ore-concentration technologies may benefit processing of the Racecourse copper-gold mineralisation, with a subsequent potential improvement to the overall project NPV. Altrius recommended that the following pre-concentration techniques had the potential to concentrate the valuable component of the copper-gold mineralisation into a smaller mass for downstream processing (in order of preference):\n\u00b7\nCoarse Particle Flotation (\"CPF\")\n\u00b7\nGravity Separation via Dense Media Separation (\"DMS\")\n\u00b7\nPre-Screening of run-of-mine ore\nMetallurgical test work samples from drill holes BRDD21-036 (168m @ 0.14% Cu & 0.06g/t Au), BRDD22-053 (320m @ 0.11% Cu & 0.06g/t Au) and BRDD21-022 (144m @ 0.25% Cu & 0.02g/t Au) were combined into two composite samples. A 94kg composite sample from drill hole BRDD22-053 (309m to 325m and 383m to 457m), with an average copper grade of 0.18% Cu, was used for the Coarse Particle Flotation test work using NovaCell\nTM\ntechnology. A composite sample from drill holes BRDD21-036 and BRDD21-022, with an average copper grade of 0.24% Cu and 0.05g/t Au, was used for the Gravity Separation and Pre-Screening test work.\nCoarse Particle Flotation Using\nNovaCell\nTM\nTechnology\nTo test the applicability of the\nNovaCell\nTM\ntechnology to process mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource, the combined sample with head grade of 0.18% Cu from drill hole BRDD22-053, was subjected to a Coarse Particle Flotation test. The flotation sample was crushed to achieve a flotation feed of P\n100\nof 600\u00b5m, following which the pulp was diluted to achieve a pulp density of 32% solids. A standard flotation scheme was adopted with a PAX collector (80g/t) and MIBC as the frother. Three concentrates were recovered over a total flotation time of 5 minutes.\nUsing the NovaCell\nTM\nprocess, Coarse Particle Flotation delivered encouraging results with 80% of the copper in the original combined sample of 0.18% Cu, being recovered into a pre-concentrated product of 2.1% Cu. The mass yield to concentrate was 11%. The results of the Coarse Particle Flotation test using NovaCell\nTM\ntechnology are given in Table One.\nTable 1 - Coarse Particle Flotation Test using NovaCell\nTM\ntechnology\nS\nample\nAssayed Grade\nRecovery (%)\nMass Yield\nCu (%)\nAu (g/t)\nS (%)\nCu\nAu\nS\n(%)\nFeed\n0.18\nN/A\n0.454\n-\n-\n-\n100\nConcentrate 1 (Froth)\n2.07\nN/A\n5.19\n70.5\nN/A\n71.7\n6.3\nConcentrate 2 (Screen)\n0.36\nN/A\n1.09\n9.1\nN/A\n11.1\n4.6\nTails\n0.04\nN/A\n0.09\n20.4\nN/A\n17.2\n89.1\nDuring the 350\u03bcm scoping test, it was observed that an excessively weak concentrate was produced, with this a possible contributor to the reduced copper recovery. Following on from this, a NovaCellTM kinetic test was implemented, using a marginally finer grind size (P80 of 350\u03bcm) with a reduced frother addition, to generate a more consistent froth phase.\nThis kinetic test yielded no marked improvement in recovery with 78% of the copper in head (0.19%) recovered into a concentrate containing 2.8% copper. The finer grind did however improve liberation and the mass yield to concentrate reduced from 11% to 5%. The finer grind also resulted in an increase in flotation kinetics, with the original scoping test (P80 470\u03bcm) requiring 40 minutes to achieve 80% copper recovery, compared with the 25 minutes required to achieve 78% copper recovery at a P80 350\u03bcm. Results from the repeat coarse particle flotation test are summarised in Table 2.\nTable 2 - NovaCellTM Kinetic Test Work Summary\nS\nample\nAssayed Grade\nRecovery (%)\nMass Yield\nCu (%)\nAu (g/t)\nS (%)\nCu\nAu\nS\n(%)\nFeed\n0.19\nN/A\n0.469\n-\n-\n-\n100\nConcentrate 1 (Froth)\n2.80\nN/A\n6.94\n78.3\nN/A\n79.1\n5.4\nTails\n0.04\nN/A\n0.09\n21.7\nN/A\n20.9\n94.6\nIn order to compare the results of the\nCoase Particle Flotation Test using NovaCell\nTM\ntechnology to conventional flotation a parallel standard rougher flotation test was conducted, at the same grind size, following which the pulp was diluted to achieve a pulp density of 31% solids. A standard flotation scheme was adopted with a PAX collector (80g/t) and MIBC as the frother. Three concentrates were recovered over a total flotation time of 5 minutes.\nThe results of the conventional flotation test are given in Table 3.\nTable 3 - Conventional Flotation Test\nS\nample\nAssayed Grade\nRecovery (%)\nMass Yield\nCu (%)\nAu (g/t)\nS (%)\nCu\nAu\nS\n(%)\nFeed\n0.18\nN/A\n0.426\n-\n-\n-\n100\nConcentrate 1 (Froth)\n4\n.63\nN/A\n11.19\n50.5\nN/A\n51.4\n2.0\nTails\n0.09\nN/A\n0.211\n49.6\nN/A\n17.2\n98.0\nThe coarse particle flotation mechanical test yielded a copper recovery of 51%, from a head grade of 0.18% Cu, into a concentrate of 4.6% Cu. The mass yield was 2%.\nIn comparison to a conventional mechanical flotation process, Coarse Particle Flotation using the\nNovaCell\nTM\ntechnology yielded superior flotation results with overall copper recovery being 30% higher using the NovaCell\nTM\ntechnology.\nPre-Screening\nPre-screening is a pre-concentration technique which exploits the natural deportment of mineralisation into finer size fractions following initial crushing in a mineral processing plant. The objective is to reject course, unmineralized material into oversize waste and concentrate the \"enriched\" finer sized material. This technique is most applicable to mineralisation associated with natural fracture patterns or with mineralisation occurring on mineral / waste grain boundaries.\nTo test the applicability of pre-screening to the copper-gold mineralisation of the Racecourse Mineral Resource, a composite 118kg sample (Comp BRDD21) was produced from drill holes BRDD21-022 (290m to 350m) and BRDD21-036 (121m to 169m). The average copper grade of the composite sample was 0.21% Cu.\nThe composite sample was subjected to simple screen sizing to establish if any upgrading of the sample could be achieved by crushing the sample to a P\n100\nof 12mm. The crushed product was then screened, using a 6mm screen, with the oversize (-12mm to +6mm) and undersize fractions subjected to assaying to determine the deportment of copper and gold into the two size fractions. The results of the pre-screening test work are given in Table 4.\nTable 4 - Pre-Screening Test Work Summary of +6mm\nSample\nSize Fraction\nMass (g)\nAssays\nDistribution\n(%)\nAu (g/t)\nCu (%)\nAu\nCu\nComp BRDD21\n-12 mm to +6mm\n10,362\n0.01\n0.15\n18.3\n57.7\nComp BRDD21\n-6mm to +3.5mm\n1,785\n0.12\n0.19\n37.8\n12.4\nComp BRDD21\n-3.5mm to +1mm\n1,631\n0.04\n0.23\n11.5\n13.5\nComp BRDD21\n+38\n\u00b5m\n1,053\n0.08\n0.34\n14.9\n13.1\nComp BRDD21\n-39\n\u00b5m\n168\n0.59\n0.54\n17.5\n3.3\nAnalysis of the pre-screening results shown above in Table 4 concluded that upgrading the copper content into a fines fraction could not be achieved by crushing the sample to 100% passing a size of 12mm. The +6mm size fraction returned a copper grade of 0.15% whilst the -6mm fraction returned a copper grade of 0.23%, in line with the head sample assay of 0.24% Cu. Regarding the metal distribution 57.7% of the copper reported to the +6mm size fraction and 42.3% reported to the -6mm size fraction.\nIn an attempt to improve pre-concentration of copper by pre-screening, finer crush sizes were tested. The composite sample was crushed to P\n100\nof 6mm and screened at 3mm and also to P\n100\nof 3mm and screened at 1mm. Neither of the two finer crush sizes resulted in any improvement in the copper deportment to the finer size fraction. Therefore, it is concluded that simple pre-screening is not a technique appropriate for pre-concentrating the copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource.\nDense Media Separation\nDense media separation (DMS), is a gravity separation process whereby particles are sorted primarily according to their densities, by introducing particles to a heavy liquid. Particles which are lighter than the density of the heavy liquid rise and a referred to as \"floats\". Particles heavier than the density of the heavy liquid fall and a referred to as \"sinks\". Particles of sulphide mineralisation are usually more dense than the surrounding barren host rock and hence should preferentially report to the \"sinks\" fraction, allowing the mineralisation to be pre-concentrated.\nTo test the applicability of DMS to pre-concentrating the copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource, the -3.35mm size fraction originating from the pre-screening test work was subjected to heavy liquid DMS separation using a heavy liquid of density 3.3 t/m\n3\n. The results are summarised in Table 5.\nTable 5 - Dense Media Separation Pre-Concentration Results Summary\nSample\nSize Fraction\nMass (g)\nDistribution\n(%)\nFeed\nSinks\nFloats\nSinks\nFloats\nComp BRDD21\n-3.35mm to +1.0mm\n485.5\n1.4\n484.1\n0.3\n99.7\nComp BRDD21\n-1.0mm to +38\n\u00b5m\n236.7\n3.1\n233.6\n1.3\n98.7\nUsing a heavy liquid of density 3.3 t/m\n3\n, only 0.3% of the rock mass reported to the \"sinks\" fraction indicating that DMS is not a technique appropriate to pre-concentrating the copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource.\nConclusions\nCoarse Particle Flotation test work, using the NovaCell\nTM\ntechnology, showed encouraging results in pre-concentrating the copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource. 80% of the head grade of the composite sample of 0.18% Cu was recovered into a pre-concentrated product of 2.1% Cu. Furthermore,\nNovaCell\nTM\nCoarse Particle Flotation delivered superior results in comparison to conventional floatation, recovering 30% more copper. Hence, the use of NovaCell\nTM\nCoarse Particle Flotation should have a positive effect on the economics of open pit mining the Racecourse Mineral Resource.\nSimple pre-screening and Dense Media Separation do not appear to be techniques effective at pre-concentrating the copper-gold mineralisation from the Racecourse Mineral Resource.\nFurther information is available from the Company's\nwebsite which details the company's project portfolio as well as a copy of this announcement:\nwww.xtractresources.com\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"UK MAR\").\nThe person who arranged for the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company was Colin Bird, Executive Chairman and Director.\nEnquiries\n:\nXtract Resources Plc\nColin Bird,\nExecutive Chairman\n+44 (0)20 3416 6471\nwww.xtractresources.com\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nRoland Cornish\nMichael Cornish\nFelicity Geidt\n+44 (0)207628 3369\nwww.beaumontcornish.co.uk\nNovum Securities Limited\nJoint Broker\nJon Belliss\nColin Rowbury\n+44 (0)\n207 399 9427\nwww.novumsecurities.com\nQualified Person\nInformation in this announcement relating to the exploration works has been reviewed by Edward (Ed) Slowey, BSc, PGeo, a consultant to Xtract.

Further details are available at www.jorc.org. See the \"Glossary of Geological and Mining Terms\" for complete definitions of mineral reserves and mineral resources.\nAbout Mineral Resources\nMineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability but do have reasonable prospect for economic extraction. They fall into three categories: measured, indicated, and inferred. The reported mineral resources are stated inclusive of mineral reserves. Measured and indicated mineral resources are sufficiently well-defined to allow geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed and permit the application of technical and economic parameters in assessing the economic viability of the mineral resource. Inferred mineral resources are estimated on limited information not sufficient to verify geological and grade continuity or to allow technical and economic parameters to be applied. Inferred mineral resources are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them. There is no certainty that mineral resources of any category will be upgraded to mineral reserves.\nImportant Information about Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimates\nWhilst the Company takes all reasonable care in the preparation and verification of the mineral reserve and resource figures. the figures are estimates based in part on forward-looking information. Estimates are based on management's knowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results, the quality of available data and management's best judgment. They are, however, imprecise by nature, may change over time, and include many variables and assumptions including geological interpretation, commodity prices and currency exchange rates, recovery rates, and operating and capital costs.\u00a0There is no assurance that the indicated levels of metal will be produced, and the Company may have to re-estimate the mineral reserves based on actual production experience. Changes in the metal price, production costs or recovery rates could make it unprofitable to operate or develop a particular deposit for a period of time.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this announcement, are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are identi\ufb01ed by their use of terms and phrases such as ''believe'', ''could'', \"should\" ''envisage'', ''estimate'', ''intend'', ''may'', ''plan'', ''will'' or the negative of those, variations or comparable expressions, including references to assumptions. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but rather on the Directors' current expectations and assumptions regarding the Company's future growth, results of operations, performance, future capital and other expenditures (including the amount, nature and sources of funding thereof), competitive advantages, business prospects and opportunities. Such forward looking statements re\ufb02ect the Directors' current beliefs and assumptions and are based on information currently available to the Directors. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements including risks associated with vulnerability to general economic and business conditions, competition, environmental and other regulatory changes, actions by governmental authorities, the availability of capital markets, reliance on key personnel, uninsured and underinsured losses and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although any forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are based upon what the Directors believe to be reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with such forward looking statements.\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (\"Beaumont Cornish\") is the Company's Nominated Adviser and is authorised and regulated by the FCA.

          "content": "8 Feb 2024 07:00\nRNS Number : 3942C\nXtract Resources plc\n08 February 2024\n8 February 2024\nUpdate on Zambian Copper Joint Venture and Strategy\nThe Board of Xtract Resources Plc (\"Xtract\", 'XTR' or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce an update on progress in Zambia with the copper exploration joint venture agreement (\"Joint Venture\") with Cooperlemon Consultancy Limited (\"CL\") first announced on 24 August 2023, and also the overall Company copper exploration strategy in Zambia. The Joint Venture is focussed on the highly prospective large scale exploration licenses 29123-HQ-LEL and 30459-HQ-LEL in Northwest Zambia (the \"Licences\").\nHighlights\nv\nThe two exploration licences are located within the Western Foreland geological district that hosts the Kamoa - Kakula deposit and the Central Fold and Thrust Belt (\"Fold Belt\") in NW Zambia.\nv\nThe two licences cover a combined 107,000 ha in a highly prospective part of Northwest Zambia where competition for exploration licences is intense.\nv\nLicence 29123 - HQ - LEL is located to the west of the perceived boundary between the Western Foreland and Fold Belt, and Licence 30459 - HQ - LEL is coincident with the boundary and may also include part of the Fold Belt.\nv\nThe Company believes there is scope for the discovery of potentially high-grade Kamoa-style mineralisation at depth and lower grade Kolwezi-type mineralisation at or near-surface.\nv\nExploration initiated with the recent acquisition of a major historic database created by Anglo American plc and enabling a cost-effective and fast-track programme.\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman said :\n\"We have recently embarked on an intensive exploration campaign targeting a discovery of commercial grade and tonnage of copper in a region of NW Zambia that is not only the subject of more intense competition than I have ever known for exploration ground but also the focus of attention for most of the world's major mining companies. NW Zambia is a proven host for large scale copper deposits and the geology of our Joint Venture ground is highly prospective. Zambia as a nation has set ambitious targets for copper production to underpin its economic progress and Xtract intends to become a part of that story initially by being the only junior company operating its own Joint Venture licences on a self-financing and independent basis\"\nBackground\nThe geology of the Licence areas subject to the Joint Venture with Cooperlemon is dominated by the architectural domain known as the Western Foreland succession (Kamoa-style mineralisation) and the neighbouring Lufilian Fold Thrust Belt that plays host to lower grade, bulk tonnage, near-surface mineralisation.\nNW Zambia is the subject of intense competition at this time not least because the style of the underlying mineralisation and associated geology is believed to be similar to that of the Kamoa-Kakula deposit operated by Ivanhoe Mines in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (\"DRC\"). The licence areas comprising the Joint Venture are projected to have continuity with the geology of the DRC and are entirely surrounded by ground under licence to, or within, partnerships or joint ventures between local companies and global leaders in the mining industry such as\nRio Tinto plc, Anglo American plc, First Quantum Minerals Ltd., and Ivanhoe Mines.\n(Figure 1)\nFigure 1: Plan Showing Exploration and Mining Licences in NW Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Relation to Exploration Licences held by Xtract Resources\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/3942C_1-2024-2-7.pdf\nMoreover, on 27 November 2023 Ivanhoe Mines announced '\ngreenfield' prospecting rights for exploration over 22,195km\u00b2 in the Angolan provinces of Moxico and Cuando Cubango. This exploration block is immediately to the west of the Joint Venture licences and believed (by Ivanhoe) to be similar to their Kamoa-Kakula province but mostly covered by Kalahari sand and Karoo volcanics where conventional exploration methods are less effective (Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Xtract Exploration Licences Illustrated in Relation to adjoining Licences which includes Licences held by Third Party Tier 1 Companies and Licences Situated in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/3942C_2-2024-2-7.pdf\nThe copper footprint in the DRC is believed to extend across the border into NW Zambia where the Joint Venture licences are located. Ivanhoe Mines' Kakula Mine in the DRC is reported to be the world's highest-grade copper mine with deep, high-grade (>5% Cu) copper mineralisation.\nThe density of Tier 1 mining companies in the region reflects the significant prospectivity of the Joint Venture licences.\nXtract, has title and managed project activities over 107,000 hectares in this highly competitive region.\nJoint Venture Agreement\nUnder the terms of the Joint Venture, Xtract has agreed a phased investment.\nIn Phase 1 the Company will earn a 65% interest in the JV by funding exploration expenditure over an initial 2-year period of not less than US$2 million. If the Phase 1 exploration results are successful, and prove the continuity of mineralisation at grades suggesting the potential for the future development of a Mineral Resource of not less than 500,000t of contained copper, then Phase 2 will be initiated with a second 2-year exploration period and a budget of US$3M. Xtract will be the operator of the licences for the 4-year duration.\nShould a trade, or any other sale, of the licences take place in the initial 2 years, then Xtract will be deemed to have a 55% interest in the Joint Venture. A sale requires the agreement of both Xtract and Cooperlemon.\nFurther information on the JV Licences\nLicence No: 29123-HQ-LEL, which comprises 88,149 ha and expires on 7 September 2025, is held by Oval Mining Limited (\"Oval\"). The application for Licence 30459-HQ-LEL, which comprises 19,600 ha and which has been approved for issue by the Zambian Mining Cadastre, is held by Far North Enterprises Limited (\"Far North\"). Both licences are located in NW Zambia adjacent to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) border. Oval and Far North have each agreed with Xtract to be bound by the terms and the conditions of the Joint Venture with Cooperlemon (who is acting on their behalf) as though they were a party to the Agreement.\nOpportunities and Prospects\nXtract acquired its interest in the Joint Venture licences by virtue of the long-standing and successful presence in Zambia of the senior management of Xtract and the historic success reflected in discovery of a now Tier 1 asset, Sentinel Mine, later developed and still operated by First Quantum Minerals (FQM). Long-term alliances formed with senior Zambian exploration companies and entrepreneurs and consultants with deep exploration experience in Zambia have created a strong platform for Xtract. There are clear cost benefits from the use of consultants with common geological skills, mobile assets and logistics/administration staff operating in the same geographic region.\nExploration Progress in Q4, 2023 and Financing\nXtract now has exclusive access to unique historic data sets generated by Anglo American plc which pre-date any proper understanding of the Western Foreland geological setting and potential. This has enabled a fast-track early-stage exploration strategy on a very cost-effective basis that will save an estimated US$1.5M in direct exploration costs during Phase 1 of the Joint Venture.\nWith funds received from Xtract's entitlement from its 23% net interest in the Manica project in Mozambique for the period ended September 2023 as announced on 24 January 2024, Phase 1 exploration commitments for the Joint Venture are available from existing cash resources meaning no fund-raise is anticipated and therefore no dilution to shareholders. The financing of Phase 2 will be based on the results from Phase 1 and also, the decision by shareholders on the proposed disposal of XTR's interest in Manica at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to be held on 13 February 2024 and detailed in the EGM circular sent to XTR shareholders which is available on the Company web site.\nProspects for Mine Development\nIn the event that either or both of the Joint Venture licences advance to a point where they reveal commercially viable copper assets that are suitable for development, then the licences will be moved to a corporate entity to be owned 75% by Xtract and 25% by Cooperlemon. It will then be the responsibility of the newly formed corporate entity to raise all capital for mine development and future operations.\nThe Zambian government has expressed a clear ambition to increase domestic Cu production from the present 830K tpa to 3M tpa by the end of the decade. This implies a clear political and strategic national support for the mining industry and the granting of licences to develop opportunities for this 'clean-energy' and battery metal. Elsewhere, for example in Central and South America, there is a mixture of sentiment from qualified support to total opposition to mining. Moreover, the complexity of permitting worldwide now means long lead times in decision-making of several years is being experienced between discovery and commissioning of Tier 1 projects.\nTaking into consideration the almost universally projected increased global demand for Cu, with a more than 40% increase to 36.6Mt expected by 2031, linked to by the 'Clean and Green' energy revolution, The Board anticipates that it is likely that Zambia will be a major source of Cu production for at least the next 75 years.\nXtract shareholders have an opportunity to share in this potentially historic rebirth of the Zambian Cu Belt.\nFurther information\nFurther information is available from the Company's website which details the company's project portfolio as well as a copy of this announcement: www.xtractresources.com\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"UK MAR\").\nThe person who arranged for the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company was Colin Bird, Executive Chairman and Director.\nEnquiries:\nXtract Resources Plc\nColin Bird,\nExecutive Chairman\n+44 (0)20 3416 6471\nwww.xtractresources.com\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser and Joint Broker\nRoland Cornish\nMichael Cornish\nFelicity Geidt\n+44 (0)207628 3369\nwww.beaumontcornish.co.uk\nNovum Securities Limited\nJoint Broker\nJon Bellis\nColin Rowbury\n+44 (0)207 399 9427\nwww.novumsecurities.com\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (\"Beaumont Cornish\"), which is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority, is acting as nominated adviser to the Company in connection with this announcement and will not regard any other person as its client and will not be responsible to anyone else for providing the protections afforded to the clients of Beaumont Cornish or for providing advice in relation to such proposals.
