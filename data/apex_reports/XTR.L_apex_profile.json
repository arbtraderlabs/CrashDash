Silverking is subject to an option and joint venture agreement (\"Joint Venture\") with Oval Mining Limited, enabling Xtract to earn-in up to a 70% interest in the Silverking copper mine and accompanying exploration licence located in the Mumbwa District of the Central Province of Zambia.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\n1,483.50 m of diamond drilling has been completed in 8 holes in phase 2 of drilling at Silver King, focussing primarily on exploration around the Kopje prospect identified at the end of phase 1, as well as infilling critical areas of the Main Body\n\u00b7\nHole SKIDD025 within the Silver King Main Body intercepted approximately 3m of visible abundant malachite consistent with the mineralisation model, confirmed with pXRF analytical measurements on site.\n\u00b7\nHoles SKIDD021, 022 and 024 were drilled into the Kopje prospect, and successfully intersected mineralisation, including:\no\nSKIDD022 intercepted approximately 8m of native copper stringers from 82m down hole in a leached oxide zone\no\nSKIDD024 intercepted about 23m from 102m downhole depth of mixed native copper, chalcocite and chalcopyrite consistent with an oxide transition zone.\n\u00b7\nLogging work is ongoing at site and samples are being prepared for dispatch for laboratory assay.\n\u00b7\nFurther holes are planned to test both the near-surface and deeper hypogene mineralisation of the Kopje prospect.\n\u00b7\nOngoing regional exploration works have also defined two new copper soil anomalies:\no\nHouse Grid Anomaly, a 200m strike length by 150m width anomaly at 5x background.\no\nSolar Anomaly, a 220m strike length by 100m width\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman of Xtract, commented\n:\n\"The Silverking programme has improved our knowledge of the Main Body where preliminary pit shell design can now be completed over the updated geological model. The mineralisation intersected at the Kopje Prospect will now be subject to additional work to test for the same mineralisation closer to surface. In parallel, we will continue to drill other high-quality anomalies that have been discovered as part of routine exploration with a view to developing a Mineral Resource Estimate for development\"\n.\nJoint Venture Agreement Outline\nAs announced on 3 April 2024, Xtract entered an initial 18-month option period to acquire a 51% interest in the project, contingent upon fulfilling expenditure commitments of US$500,000. With the completion of the current phase of drilling that expenditure threshold has now been reached. Xtract has the option to increase its interest to 70% by expending an additional US$1,000,000 over the subsequent two years, subject to Cooperlemon's right to maintain its interest in the licence through its option to earn back up to 70% by participating in such ongoing expenditure.\nTechnical Sign-Off\nTechnical information in this announcement has been reviewed by Edward (Ed) Slowey, BSc, PGeo, Technical Advisor to Xtract. Mr Slowey is a geologist with more than 40 years' relevant experience in mineral exploration and mining, a founder member of the Institute of Geologists of Ireland and is a Qualified Person under the AIM rules.\u00a0Mr Slowey has reviewed and approved this announcement.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"UK MAR\").

Results received indicate a significant extension of the high-grade mineralisation, tripling the known surface expression to over 260m strike length. Key intercepts from the Silverking breccia pipe include:\no\n24.1m at\n5.99% Cu and 40.2 g/t Ag\nfrom 111.0m in borehole SKIDD010\no\n29.70m at\n4.15% Cu and 42.9 g/t Ag\nfrom 93.0m in borehole SKIDD003\no\n54.1 m at\n3.18% Cu and 40.3 g/t Ag\nfrom 56.9m in borehole SKIDD002\n\u00b7\nThe drilling data is expected to support the development of an in-house, non-code compliant mineral resource estimate for Silverking, that together with a metallurgical study aimed at evaluating the lower-grade mineralised halo will inform potential mine planning and future mine economics\n\u00b7\nA ground VTEM survey identified a second mineralised structure sub-parallel to the main\nSilverking orebody\n. Further drilling is planned following a\n9m intercept at\n4.68% Cu\nand\n38.67 g/t Ag\nfrom 228m in borehole SKIDD018\n\u00b7\nAdditional targets on the\nSilverking project\ninclude the\nKopje prospect\n, where multiple structures intersecting a steep dolomitic hill yielded 4.3m at 2.55% Cu and 30.40 g/t Ag in a surface channel sample. Further potential has been identified at the\nWorm prospect\nwhere a 2km long sinuous structure may represent an extension of the regional structure associated with the nearby Kitumba Mine (27.9 Mt @ 2.2% Cu). Ground VTEM geophysical and geochemical studies are ongoing to define potential drill targets\n\u00b7\nInitial lithological drilling at the\nWestern Foreland project\nhas confirmed the presence of prospective stratigraphic units that have the potential to host Kamoa-Kakula-style high-grade copper mineralisation. These units will be further explored via the use of geophysical surveys and a follow-up Phase 1 drilling campaign\n\u00b7\nReconnaissance geochemical work has also identified eight copper stream-sediment anomalies within the\nExternal Fold & Thrust Belt of the Western Foreland project.\nThese will be the focus of Phase 2 exploration activities\n\u00b7\nXtract have acquired 80% of Moroccan based mineral development company\nWildstone SARL\nwith the intention of developing a near-term, small-scale, near-term antinomy operation. Xtract will manage the exploration and development of the project and meet an expenditure commitment of not less than US$900,000 over an initial 3-year period\n\u00b7\nWildstone SARL\nhold the exploration and extraction rights for copper, silver, and antinomy across 20 non-contiguous licences in Central Morocco which boast the potential for the rapid development towards a small-scale mining operation\n\u00b7\nThe company also acquired dump material from various sites in the Zambian Copperbelt, valued at US$1.15 per tonne, for a total investment of US$300,000, representing an attractive investment for the company\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nNet loss of \u00a31.17m (H1 2024: Loss of \u00a30.16m)\n\u00b7\nAdministration & operating expenses \u00a30.78m (H1 2024: \u00a30.82m)\n\u00b7\nCash of \u00a30.94m (FY 2024: \u00a32.17m)\n\u00b7\nTotal assets of \u00a317.58m (FY 2024: \u00a319.21m)\nOperational Overview\nDuring the reporting period, the focus was on evaluating prospective mining opportunities at the advanced\nSilverking Cu-Ag Iron-Oxide-Copper-Gold project.\nA phase 1 drilling programme completed on the licence delivered highly encouraging results, more than tripling the surface expression of the high-grade mineralized core at the main Silverking orebody. Ongoing work includes the assessment of the broader potential of the Silverking project, including satellite target evaluations and metallurgical studies on the lower-grade mineralised halo surrounding the main Silverking breccia pipe. The aim is to gather an early indication of the viability of any future mining operations.\nAt the\nWestern Foreland project\n, continued exploration has confirmed the presence of promising lithologies that are known to host the world-class Kakula-Kamoa deposit, located along-strike to the northeast in the Western Foreland mineral district. The focus for the upcoming season includes identifying drill-ready targets and refining several near-surface geochemical anomalies identified within the Western Foreland and Fold and Thrust Belt domains.\nA strategic shift towards identifying a future copper operation has seen Xtract focus on increasing its land position in central and northern Africa, using funds raised from the sale of its interest in the Manica Gold Mine in Mozambique. Several acquisitions have been agreed, including an 80% investment in\nWildstone SARL\n, a Moroccan based mineral exploration and development company with rights to copper, silver and antinomy assets in central Morocco. The Wildstone joint venture holds strong potential to progress quickly toward a small-scale operation.\nFurther expansion efforts in Zambia include a collaboration agreement with Chilibwe Mining Ltd, covering mining licence 22118-HQ-LEL, situated along-strike from the operating Mufulira Mine. Additionally, the company has invested US$300,000 in acquiring dump material across the Zambian Copperbelt, valued at US$1.15 per tonne.\nZambia\nSilverking Cu - Ag Project, Mumba District, Zambia\nA Phase 1 diamond drilling programme was completed at Silverking during the reporting period. The main aims of the drilling were to assess the continuity of the main Silverking orebody at surface and at depth, indicate the potential scale of wall-rock alteration assemblages and any potential lower-grade mineralised envelopes surrounding the main breccia pipe body, and test recently discovered satellite targets.\nThe results returned from the drilling have so far tripled the surface expression of the high-grade copper and silver mineralisation to over 260m and include consistent returns of mineralisation over downhole intervals of 25m. The results from the drilling are available in Table 1, with the best results summarized below.\n\u00b7\nSKIDD010: 24.1m at\n5.99% Cu and 40.2 g/t Ag\nfrom 111.0m\n\u00b7\nSKIDD003: 29.70m at\n4.15% Cu and 42.9 g/t Ag\nfrom 93.0m\n\u00b7\nSKIDD002: 54.1 m at\n3.18% Cu and 40.3 g/t Ag\nfrom 56.9m\n\u00b7\nSKIDD012: 10.1m at\n4.09% Cu and 15.5 g/t Ag\nfrom 88.9m\n\u00b7\nSKIDD018: 9m at\n4.68% Cu and 38.67 g/t Ag\nfrom 228m\nSufficient drill data has been generated during the Phase 1 drilling to allow for an initial non-code compliant estimation of mineral resources at Silverking to direct internal mine planning.\nDrillhole SKIDD018 intersected a second mineralized body sub-parallel to the main Silverking orebody which confirms the presence of additional near-surface mineralisation. Further follow-up drilling is planned.\nFurther licence wide exploration identified additional targets, including at the Kopje prospect, located to the south of the main Silverking orebody. At Kopje multiple structures have been identified intersecting a steep dolomitic hill. The prominent structure is oriented N-S over a strike length of 1km and there is evidence of associated sulphide mineralisation. Channel sampling over prominent structures returned 4.3m at 2.55% Cu and 30.40 g/t Ag and preparatory work is underway to provide access for roughly 2,000m of drilling in the following drilling season.\nAn additional high-priority target has been identified at the Worm prospect, where a 2km long sinuous structure has been identified along the western boundary of the licence. It is thought that the structure identified could represent an extension of the regional structure that hosts the neighbouring Kitumba mine (27.9Mt @ 2.2% Cu). Further work is contingent on the outcome of continued exploration.\nGround exploration and targeting will continue on the licence with the use of VTEM geophysical equipment and surface geochemical surveys, that together are capable of identifying mineralisation under the blind sand cover. The use of VTEM geophysical surveys can identify targets to depths of up to 400m and the methodology was crucial in the discovery of the blind mineralised structure intersected in SKIDD018.\nIn continuation to the on-going economic studies on the project, metallurgical samples of the lower-grade halo surrounding the main Silverking breccia-pipe have been prepared. It is anticipated that effective pre-concentration processes will be established that have the potential to enhance the economic viability of any future mining operation. Bulk samples will be subjected to conventional gravity separation techniques to generate enhanced pre-concentrate material that is suitable for downstream processing and final beneficiation.\nTable 1 - Summary of mineralised intervals intersected during the Phase 1 drilling at Silverking\nFurther licence wide potential remains, associated with a second breccia pipe structure identified 800m from the main Silverking orebody, that is coincident with surface anomalism, and several magnetic anomalies near the main body that could represent mineralized off-shoots.\nSilverking Cu-Ag Project Background\nThe Silverking project comprises exploration licence 26673-HQ-LEL which covers an area of 82km in the Mumbwa District, Central Province of Zambia. The licence is considered highly prospective for the discovery of deposits of copper associated with the Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) model, and neighbours the Kitumba deposit, which in 2024 received a US$58.5m investment for a 65% interest from Chinese Investors Sinomine Resources Group. The licence is subject to a joint venture agreement with Oval Mining Limited, who are in cooperation with Cooperlemon Consultancy and Xtract have the option to earn up to a 70% interest.\nThe initial joint venture period to acquire a 51% interest in the project was contingent upon fulfilling expenditure commitments of US$500,000. Following the completion of the Phase 1 drilling the expenditure threshold has been reached and Xtract have the option to increase its interest to 70% by expending an additional US$1,000,000\nover the subsequent two years. This is subject to Cooperlemon's right to maintain its interest in the licence and earn back up to 70%, by participating in such ongoing expenditure.\nMineralisation at Silverking shares many characteristics associated with the nearby Kitumba deposit, including a prominent breccia pipe that hosts vein and stockwork hosted copper, deep levels of intense oxidation, and high-grade supergene enrichment.\nHistorical drilling at the Silverking mine was exceptionally high-grade, 1m intercepts peaked at over 52% Cu, and a best interval of 50m @ 5.47% Cu was returned from 55m downhole in in drillhole SVKRC002. Historical exploration was focussed on the discovery of a tier one deposit and data compilation suggests that high-grade supergene mineralisation was not targeted down-dip or down-plunge, resulting in several drill holes ending in mineralisation.\nWestern Foreland Cu Project, Western Foreland Mineral District, Zambia\nReconnaissance works have been completed on all 5 licences during the reporting period, including mapping, geophysical interpretation, detailed ground magnetic surveys, stream sediment sampling and diamond drilling.\nThree diamond drillholes were drilled on licence 29123-HQ-LEL for a total of 529.4m of drilling. The holes were designed to map the underlying lithology and structure on the licence. Combined with surface geological mapping, the drilling was successful in identifying the lithological and structural architecture and identified several prospective characteristics capable of hosting redox fronts, and in turn, high-grade Kamoa-style mineralisation. Further interrogation of these horizons will form the basis of Phase 2 exploration during 2025.\nA total of eight stream-sediment copper anomalies were identified on the 4 adjoining licences (30458-HQ-LEL, 30459-HQ-LEL, 21850-HQ-LEL and 21851-HQ-LEL) located within the Fold & Thrust Belt domain, these anomalies will be investigated for their Kolwezi-style copper mineralisation potential during Phase 2 exploration in 2025.\nThe Phase 2 exploration programme will focus on evaluating mapped and inferred redox boundaries identified during the lithological studies accomplished in Phase 1, conducting detailed ground electro -magnetic (EM) and magnetic surveys along selected profiles, and following-up prospective targets with diamond drilling. Exploration is expected to re-commence at the end of the rainy season in mid-2025.\nWestern Foreland Cu Project Background\nThe project comprises five large scale exploration licences totalling 173,586 Ha across the prospective Western Foreland and Fold & Thrust Belt geological districts of Northwestern Zambia, collectively known as the Western Foreland. The Western Foreland region is an emerging copper district, underexplored to date and subject to investment and fresh geological remodelling from leading global exploration companies. Significant potential exists for the discovery of high-grade and high-tonnage copper deposits akin to Ivanhoe Mines Kamoa-Kakula complex, which is situated just 100km along strike in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Ivanhoe continue to make discoveries in the region and have reported a total of 48Mt of copper discovered to date. Recent exploration at the Kitoko deposit discovered copper mineralisation in previously unknown stratigraphic horizons, highlighting the prospectivity and potential of the whole region. Additionally, The Fold & Thrust Belt terrane hosts the bulk tonnage Kolwezi deposit, with potential for similar discovery extending over the licences.\nXtract's primary objective since acquisition has been to define the stratigraphy and prospective redox boundaries that host copper mineralisation in the region. Redox fronts are situated between oxidised and reducing strata and can be targeted based on lithological succession, manifested in the local stratigraphy. Reconnaissance surface mapping and lithological drilling completed to date have been successful in establishing the prospective stratigraphy of the target area and have provided invaluable information for a broader exploration programme.\nDump Material, Zambian Copperbelt\nOn the 6 February 2025, Xtract announced an agreement to purchase dump material from several sites situated in the Zambian Copperbelt, for a consideration of US$300,000 to be funded from existing cash resources. It is the intention to conduct trial test work and evaluation of the material that is valued at US$1.15 per tonne and will be recovered from the sellers' sites in Zambia by Xtract. The seller remains liable for and shall pay any statutory royalties or any other duties or charges due to the relevant authorities on the sale of any material to Xtract.\nChilibwe Cu Joint Venture Project, Zambia\nIn the previous reporting period Xtract announced that it had signed an exclusive collaboration agreement with Chilibwe Mining Limited in relation to large scale exploration licence 22118-HQ_LEL, known as the Chilibwe/Ngala project. The licence covers 27,527ha and is situated in North Central Zambia on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to the northwest of Eurasian Resources Group's Frontier mine, and the southeast of the historic Mufulira copper mine.\nThe licence is currently subject to a dispute with the previous joint venture partner which has restricted Chilibwe from developing the project, and a case has been lodged with the High Court for Zambia to have the existing joint venture terminated, releasing the 100% interest in the licence back to Chilibwe.\nOnce the dispute is resolved Xtract will initially provide guidance to assess the prospectivity of the Licence, and contingent on results may assist Chilibwe in securing finance to develop the licence in return for a 25% interest in the project. Xtract has made no commitment to provide any funding from its own sources to the project.\nKakuyu Cu-Co Project, Mumbwa Province, Zambia\nThe Kakuyu project is located approximately 53km north-west of the town of Mumbwa, in the Central Province of Zambia. The project comprises a small-scale mining licence that is inclusive of the small historic Kakuyu open pit, and an adjacent exploration licence. The Kakuyu open pit was subject to a small-scale mining operation prior to acquisition, and the region is well-known for mining, including the nearby mines and occurrences of Sable Antelope, True Blue, Crystal Jacket, Maurice F Gifford, Lou Lou, Silverking and Kamiyobo. The most recent discovery is the Iron Oxide Copper Gold (\"IOCG\") Kitumba deposit.\nWork continues to define the potential for a future open pit mining operation, as well as assess the wider licence area for concentrations of additional mineralisation.\nMorocco\nWildstone SARL Joint-Venture Agreement, Morocco\nOn the 26 February 2025 Xtract announced the acquisition of an initial 50% shareholding in Moroccan based minerals exploration and development company Wildstone SARL, who are actively developing small-scale mining opportunities in Morocco with a prominence in antinomy, copper and silver. Post year-end on the 15 July 2025 Xtract announced it had increased its interest in Wildstone to 80%, conditional on the agreed phased expenditure of not less than US$900,000 over the initial three-year period. The granting of the additional 30% equity reflects the commitment by both parties to develop a significant antinomy business in Morocco.\nWildstone has 20 non-contiguous licences located in Central Morocco and holds the rights for the exploration and extraction of copper, silver and antimony.\u00a0The licences are valid until October 2026, pending any future renewals, and have received limited exploration to date.\nPost-year end it was announced that an initial 90-day reconnaissance programme on the antinomy licences had completed. The licences are located within the Fez-Meknes and Beni Mellal-Khenifra directorates of northern Morocco, situated within two strategic districts inside the \"Antimony Triangle,\" an area bounded by the cities of Rabat, Fez, and Khenifra. Together, the licences cover approximately 380 square kilometres, incorporating areas of known antimony mineralisation, newly identified mineralised structures, potential extensions of antimony-bearing veins, and several former commercial producing mines.\nXtract's technical team are leading exploration activities on priority targets which will include detailed ground truthing, ground geophysics and subsequent drilling. A small team of experienced, newly appointed Moroccan geologists are accompanied by a local geological service provider and they will soon be joined by a mining engineer, bringing the local team to seven persons.\nXtract is actively building partnerships with small-scale miners operating within and nearby its licences, building on the experience and local knowledge of its Moroccan partners in the sourcing, processing, and trade of antimony ores. Xtract continues to engage with the relevant ministries as well as local landowners and the small-scale mining community. Wildstone intends that ore will be processed using basic equipment that is currently in use for similar sites in Morocco, and if the exploration is successful and deemed appropriate then a more sophisticated plant will be built.\nWildstone SARL Collaboration Agreement Background\nWildstone was incorporated in Casablanca, Morocco on 22 September 2021 with company number 516789 and its main activity is mining, exploration and extraction in Morocco.\u00a0Wildstone has 20 exploration licences (and not 15 as previously reported in February) which were issued in July 2023 for the exploration and extraction of copper, silver and antimony and which are situated in Central Morocco (but not contiguous).\u00a0To date, very limited exploration has taken place and these licences are due for renewal in July and October 2026. In addition, a further 4 licences were subsequently acquired by Wildstone for a nominal amount in May 2025 (\"New Licences\") and these New Licences will be due for renewal May 2028.\nOn 26 February 2025, Xtract announced that it had acquired a 50% share in Wildstone. Under the terms of the agreement Xtract committed to spend US$900,000 over a period of 3 years which will make up the minimum spend on the licences. Post year-end, on the 15 July 2025, Xtract announced that it had increased its interest in Wildstone to 80%. With the addition of the new licences, Xtract has committed a further US$300,000 for exploration expenditure (being the minimum spend on the new licences). It is the aim of the joint venture to establish one, or more, JORC resources.\nSmall and Larger Scale Mine Development\nThe parties anticipate that the collaboration could rapidly progress towards small scale mining. Any small-scale mining operation developed will utilise Wildstone's own contractors, and the capital funding for the operation of US$200,000 will be provided by Xtract, who will be allowed to recover the initial capital by being paid 75% of free cashflow. Xtract shall be responsible for all small-scale development funding until such time as the operation is demonstrating a surplus income over expenditures (including sustaining and maintenance capital). On full capital repayment, Xtract will be entitled to 60% of all profits.\nThe small-scale development will continue during the exploration phase and will be replaced or may run concurrently if the potential for a larger more sophisticated processing plant is identified (larger scale development). For the purposes of defining potential for a larger scale development, the criteria to be used is not less than 5 years mine life at a minimum annual throughput of 150,000 tonnes, with a DCF model demonstrating a payback of not more than 18 months and a return on investment not less than 20%.\nXtract will be expected to fund 100% of the larger scale development, anticipated to be US$1million on the plant design, construction, implementation and commissioning. On commencement of production, Xtract will receive 60% of cashflow for capital recovery, the remainder will be shared 70% to Xtract and 30% to the existing shareholders in Wildstone. This arrangement will continue for 18 months, or until the capital is fully repaid, whichever is the shorter. After the completion of the 18-month period, the profits will be shared 80% to Xtract and 20% to the existing shareholders.\nMozambique\nManica Gold Project, Mozambique\nOn the 25 February 2025 an amendment to the Manica sale agreement was agreed with the vendors MMP. In the amended agreement the US$3 million balloon payment due on or before 1 March 2027 will be split over three payments of US$1 million each due on, or before, the 1 March 2027, 1 June 2027, and 1 September 2027. The payment schedule for the deferred consideration of US$3 million that becomes payable upon the buyer's decision to build a sulphide plant will now be payable over six payments on the amended basis detailed below.\n\u00b7\nUS$250,000 within the earlier of i) 14 days of the decision to build a sulphide plant and ii) 1 December 2026;\n\u00b7\nUS$250,000 within the earlier of i) 14 days of commencement of dry commissioning of the sulphide plant and ii) 1 December 2027;\n\u00b7\nUS$500,000 within the earlier of i) 14 days of the sulphide plant processing 30,000 tonnes in any 30-day period (\"commercial production\"); and ii) 1 March 2028;\n\u00b7\nUS$750,000 within the earlier of i) 3 months of the sulphide plant achieving commercial production; and ii) 1 June 2028;\n\u00b7\nUS$750,000 within the earlier of i) 6 months of the sulphide plant achieving commercial production; and ii) 1 September 2028; and\n\u00b7\nUS$500,000 within the earlier of i) 9 months of the sulphide plant achieving commercial production; and ii) 1 December 2028.\nAll other terms of the Agreement remain unchanged and can be found in the RNS released 24 January 2024.\nThe sale agreement was amended on the grounds that mining is due to progress to the more complex ore stage, where the material being mined will transition between oxide ore and sulphide ore, thus reducing overall recovery and profitability. During the process of designing the sulphide flow sheet the buyers have acquired additional sulphide projects in the adjacent area, and the differing metallurgical characteristics of these may affect the overall design of the sulphide plant. Because of this the buyers asked that the payment schedule be amended to allow time for additional testing, and Xtract have agreed on the basis that this will assist with a smooth transition from oxide to sulphide mining and a revised oxide mining plan which will ensure continuity of operations and maintain a stable working environment at Manica. The cashflow from which is being used to pay Xtract.\nManica Project Sale Agreement Background\nOn 24 January 2024 Xtract announced the disposal of its 23% interest in the Manica Gold project. The decision was strategic, allowing the disposal of the financial risk associated with the Manica project as it progressed towards the complex ore mining phase, whilst providing the opportunity to advance their copper interests.\nAn initial US$3.325m was paid under the terms of the mining collaboration agreement, received from its partner MMP, which released Xtract and Explorator (Xtract's local Mozambique subsidiary) from the agreement. A further US$15m will be settled via staged payments to 28 December 2028 (the rescheduled date). Under the sale agreement, if the buyer fails to meet the staged payment schedule, the exploration licence and mineral resource will be returned to Xtract.\nThe disposal decision was based on an assessment of the risks associated with the future nature of the ore to be extracted from the Manica project. As the volume of the more simply processed oxide ore is depleted, the project moves into the more complex mixed oxide/sulphide mining stage, which has yet to be fully scoped. Inconclusive studies projecting the metallurgy and recovery of gold in deeper sulphide mineralisation, incomplete information regarding future capital expenditure for sulphide mining and necessary infrastructure improvements, and the limited capacity for Xtract management to have influence during the decision-making process as a minority shareholder were all risk factors taken into consideration.\nAustralia\nBushranger Cu-Au Project, Lachlan Fold Belt, New South Wales\nA two-stage review of potential ore pre-concentration methodologies was completed in the previous reporting period by Altrius Consulting Pty. The study aimed to assess the potential impact of ore pre-concentrate upgrade on the overall financial viability of the project.\nThe study concluded that coarse particle flotation tests, using advanced NovaCellTM kinetic flotation equipment technology provided the best results, yielding 78% of copper mineralisation into only 5% of the mass, achieving an upgraded pre-concentrate product of 2.8% Cu. The study also concluded that NovaCellTM coarse particle flotation recovered 30% more copper than conventional flotation, and therefore it is concluded that the use of NovaCellTM kinetic technology on any future operation developed at Bushranger will have a significant positive impact on the processing costs of the copper-gold mineralisation, increasing mine viability.\nWork continues to evaluate and progress the Bushranger project towards operation.\nEnquiries\n:\nXtract Resources Plc\nColin Bird, Executive Chairman\n+44 (0)20 3416 6471\nBeaumont Cornish\n(Nominated Adviser)\nRoland Cornish\nMichael Cornish\nFelicity Geidt\nEmail:\ncorpfin@b-cornish.co.uk\n+44 (0)20 7628 3369\nNovum Securities Limited\n(Joint Broker)\nColin Rowbury/Jon Belliss\n+44 (0)207 399 9427\nShard Capital Partners (Joint Broker\nGareth Burchell / Damon Heath\n+44 (0) 207 186 9951\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"UK MAR\").

General information\nXtract Resources PLC (\"Xtract\") is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The Company's registered address is 1st Floor, 7/8 Kendrick Mews, London, SW7 3HG. The Company's ordinary shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company invests and engages in the management, financing and development of early-stage resource assets.\n2. Accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nXtract prepares its annual financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and in conformity with the Companies Act 2006.\nThe consolidated interim financial information for the period ended 30 June 2025 presented herein has been neither audited nor reviewed. The information for the period ended 31 December 2024 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 but has been derived from those accounts. The auditor's report on those accounts was not qualified and did not contain statements under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. As permitted, the Group has chosen not to adopt IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'.\nThe Interim financial information is presented in pound sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (\u00a3'000) unless otherwise stated.\nThe interim consolidated financial information of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2025 were authorised for issue by the Directors on 29 September 2025.\nGoing concern\nAs at 30 June 2025 the Group held cash balances of \u00a30.94 million. An operating loss has been reported for the Group.\nOn 24 January 2024, the Company announced that it had agreed terms for the disposal of the Manica Gold Project with its Mozambique partner, MMP. The Share Purchase Agreement in relation to the sale by the Company of its entire interests in the project for a consideration of up to US$15 million in cash in regular staged payments by the Buyers over the period to 1 March 2027.\nAs at the date of the release of the consolidated financial information, the Group had received the 7th quarterly payment of US$0.75m from the proceeds of the sale of the Manica Asset. The Group has continued with its exploration activities in Zambia and Australia.\nThe Directors anticipate net operating cash inflows for the Group for the next twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.\nThe Directors have assessed the working capital requirements for the forthcoming twelve months and have undertaken assessments which have considered different scenarios based on exploration spend on its exploration projects in Zambia, Morocco and Australia until September 2026.\nUpon reviewing those cash flow projections for the forthcoming twelve months, the directors consider that the Company is not likely to require additional financial resources in the twelve-month period from the date of approval of these financial statements to enable the Company to fund its current operations and to meet its commitments. The Group will continue to monitor corporate overhead costs on an ongoing basis.\nThe Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial information and therefore the consolidated financial information does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the going concern basis of preparation of the consolidated financial information is not appropriate.\nOn this basis the Board believes that it is appropriate to prepare the consolidated financial information on the going concern basis.\nChanges in accounting policy\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Group Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, except for the changes arising from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements detailed below.\nThere are no amendments or interpretations to accounting standards that would have a material impact on the financial statements.\n3. Business segments\nSegmental information\nThe divisions on which the Group reports its primary segment information are reported to its Executive Chairman, who is the Chief Operating Decision maker of the Group. The Executive Chairman and the Chief Operating Officer are responsible for allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance.\nPrincipal activities are as follows:\n\u00b7\nExploration\n\u00b7\nInvestment and other\nSegment results\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\nExploration (Continuing)\nInvestment\nAnd Other\n(Continuing)\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAdministrative and operating expenses\n-\n(781)\n(781)\nDirect Operating\n-\n(7)\n(7)\nOther Operating\n-\n(100)\n(100)\nAdministration\n-\n(674)\n(674)\nProject expenses\n-\n(26)\n(26)\nOperating profit/(loss)\n-\n(807)\n(807)\nOther gains and losses\n-\n42\n42\nFinance (cost)/income\n-\n(264)\n(264)\nProfit/(loss) before tax\n-\n(1,029)\n(1,029)\nTaxation\n(139)\n(139)\nProfit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations\n-\n(1,168)\n(1,168)\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nMine Development (Continuing)\nExploration (Continuing)\nInvestment and Other (Continuing)\nAlluvial Gold Mining Production (Continuing)\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nSegment revenue\nSale of gold bars\n-\n-\n-\n393\n393\nLess:\nCost of sales\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSegment Gross profit\n-\n-\n-\n393\n393\nOther operating income\n-\n-\n1,669\n-\n1,669\nNon-operating income\nAdministrative and operating expenses\n-\n(94)\n(352)\n(605)\n(1,051)\nProject Costs\n-\n(184)\n(34)\n(208)\n(426)\nSegment result\n-\n(278)\n1,283\n(420)\n585\nOther gain and losses\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nFinance costs\n-\n-\n47\n(10)\n37\n(Loss)/profit before tax\n-\n(278)\n1,330\n(430)\n622\nTax\n-\n-\n-\n(1)\n(1)\n(Loss)/Profit for the period\n-\n(278)\n1,330\n(431)\n621\nYear 31 December 2024\nExploration (Continuing)\nInvestment and Other (Continuing)\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nOther operating income\n-\n4\n4\nAdministrative and operating expenses\n-\n(1,380)\n(1,380)\nProject Costs\n-\n(30)\n(30)\nSegment result\n-\n(1,406)\n(1,406)\nOther gains and losses\n-\n620\n620\nFinance income / (costs)\n-\n367\n367\n(Loss)/Profit before tax\n-\n(419)\n(419)\nTax\n-\n(395)\n(395)\n(Loss)/Profit for the period\n-\n(814)\n(814)\nBalance Sheet\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n31 December 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTotal Assets\nGold production\n-\n-\n-\nExploration\n7,461\n8,234\n11,520\nInvestment & other\n10,117\n2,021\n7,685\nTotal segment assets\n17,578\n10,255\n19,205\nAssets relating to discontinued operations\n-\n10,008\n-\nConsolidated total assets\n17,578\n20,263\n19,205\nLiabilities\nGold production\n-\n-\n-\nExploration\n(167)\n(222)\n(195)\nInvestment & other\n(706)\n(406)\n(637)\nTotal segment liabilities\n(873)\n(628)\n(832)\nLiabilities relating to discontinued operations\n-\n-\n-\nConsolidated total liabilities\n(873)\n(628)\n(832)\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group's accounting policies which are described in the Group's latest annual financial statements.

          "content": "16 Sep 2025 14:20\nRNS Number : 5675Z\nXtract Resources plc\n16 September 2025\n16 September 2025\nFor immediate release\nXtract Resources Plc\n(\"Xtract\" or the \"Company\")\nAcquisition of Amghas Antimony Licences\nThe Board of Xtract Resources Plc (\"Xtract\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the acquisition by its 80 per cent owned subsidiary, Wildstone SARL (\"Wildstone) of two further exploration licences in Morocco (the \"Amghas Licences\" or \"Amghas\"), following the completion of extensive due diligence.\nAssessment of Amghas has highlighted the prospectivity of the licences and in particular the opportunity for the reinstatement of the former producing mine at the site. Evidence of numerous high-grade antimony veins visible at surface and in underground workings provide the motivation for the planned exploration programme that has already commenced with a view to establishing a Mineral Resource ahead of reinstatement of mine status.\nProject Highlights:\n\u00b7\nReinstatement of the Mining Licence underway: A baseline study and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) have been initiated as part of the statutory requirements to reinstate the mining licence at Amghas\n\u00b7\nMultiple high-grade antimony-rich veins and associated mineralised brecciation identified both at surface and underground\n\u00b7\nHistoric small-scale exploitation of antimony mineralisation with a focus only on extremely high-grade (>40% Sb) veins. Potential for a larger mineable resource due to previously unprocessed disseminated mineralisation\n\u00b7\nStructural mapping identified continuity of mineralised structures over several kilometres, connecting with historic Amghas workings thereby expanding exploration potential\nExecutive Chairman Colin Bird commented:\n\"The acquisition of the Amghas Licences, presents an early potential opportunity to commence antimony concentrate production for sale into international markets, where demand for this critical metal is rising. We look forward to sharing the results of our drone and geophysical surveys and publishing our initial Mineral Resource Estimate with shareholders\".\nAmghas Licences\nWildstone has acquired two further exploration licences in Morroco for a total consideration of US$105,000 funded by Xtract. The exploration licences are for a period of three years expiring on 6 June and 25 July 2026 respectively. In aggregate, the Amghas licence cover an area of 32 square kilometres and are located in the Khenifra Province, Morrocco.\nThe Amghas Licences host multiple high-grade antimony sulphide veins, which were last mined underground in the late 1950s. The acquisition is a key development in Wildstone's antimony licence portfolio in Morocco. The former producing mine at Amghas will be a focus for initial exploration and development activity with potential for antimony production from the multiple outcropping antimony sulphide veins and the extensive underground network of partially exploited mineralised structures.\nThe nature and density of antimony veins in and around Amghas supports a detailed evaluation of the site and a focus on the development of a preliminary resource estimate and mine plan.\nGeological mapping has identified vein systems extending beyond the immediate historic mine workings, in some instances connecting higher-grade Amghas veins to other historical workings located several kilometres away along strike. These zones present obvious follow-up targets.\nHistoric mining focused on hand-sorted, visually identifiable ore, overlooking relatively lower-grade, disseminated wallrock mineralisation. Underground channel sampling will be conducted to assess antimony grades within exposed veins, wallrock alteration and breccias adjacent to the high-grade veins, which have previously recorded antimony grades exceeding 40% Sb.\nWildstone's local geologists will be joined by Xtract's senior geological team to assist with the establishment of a programme of evaluation of the Amghas licence and surrounding Wildstone licences.\nTechnical Sign-Off\nTechnical information in this announcement has been reviewed by Colin Bird, C.Eng, FIMMM, South African and UK Certified Mine Manager and Director of Xtract Resources plc, with more than 40 years' experience mainly in hard rock mining and is a Qualified Person under the AIM rules.\u00a0Mr Bird has reviewed and approved this announcement.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of UK Domestic Law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"UK MAR\").
