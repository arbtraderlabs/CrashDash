Pumice is currently mined elsewhere in the US as natural pozzolan and at Hazen it was mined as a lightweight aggregate from a shallow open pit some decades ago.\nThe markets for natural pozzolan, as a replacement for cement and fly ash in concrete, are regional and reflect the distribution of the main areas of high population density where concrete demand is highest.\nThe Hazen pozzolan deposit is just 9km from a rail siding on the arterial east-west Union Pacific line and is therefore well positioned for rail transport to the regional markets of northern California, points east, as well as the local markets around Reno and northern Nevada.\nThe Company's laboratory testwork to date has shown that the material present in the pit exceeds the specifications of ASTM standard C618 for natural pozzolan. The Hazen pumice has the additional property that it is lightweight and has potential as a lightweight aggregate for use in lightweight concrete blocks and facing stones.\nThe Optioner completed a drilling programme at Hazen in Autumn 2025.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

EPIC: \"SRES\".\nWebsite:\nwww.sunriseresourcesplc.com\nDetailed Information\nThe December 2025 field-work programme followed on from the July 2025 receipt of all remaining core samples from Tolsa's drill testing of the Pioche sepiolite deposit in 2024 and the Company's Phase 1 and 2 development testwork, details of which were reported in previous 2025 news announcements.\nThe field-work programme work was carried out by Mr Patrick Cheetham (geologist) and Mr Tom Powell, the Company's 20% partner in the project and an acknowledged expert on the processing and mining of industrial clays, especially sepiolite.\nThe first objective of the December 2025 field work was to locate and sample surface outcrops of high grade sepiolite for submission to potential partners for the project. This was carried out successfully and seven mini-bulk samples were collected across the project area.\nThe second objective was to review in detail the remaining \"core\" samples collected by Tolsa via sonic drilling and to select further samples for testing using the sample preparation techniques developed by Mr Powell which were previously reported in 2025.\nIt is clear from this review that Tolsa's sampling of core and subsequent testwork has been quite selective. Several additional and unsampled zones of sepiolite clay of varying grades were identified which have potential to add to the economic value of the deposit.\nAs a result of this core review a further 44 samples have been taken from the drill cores for further testing and for supply to interested parties.\nThe testing programme now planned for these samples is designed to demonstrate the commercial properties of the Pioche deposit over a wider range of samples than tested by the Company to-date. This includes testing to confirm its for use in oil and gas drilling in saltwater formations (see \"About Sepiolite\" below) an important market for sepiolite in the USA. This application was not tested by Tolsa but the Company's testing on a limited number of to date, as reported in 2025, gave positive results.\nA number of samples collected in December 2025 have been submitted to an interested party in Europe, a large industrial minerals company.\nFurther information will be provided as it becomes available.\nAbove:\nRecovering boulders of sepiolite clay from outcrop prior to bulk sampling.\nAbove\n:Boxed core samples from sonic drilling in storage. Samples being tested for moisture content. Sepiolite, due to its high absorbency can contain as much as 50% moisture.\nAbove.\nCore samples of sepiolite clay. Orange red spots result from chemical field tests using a chemical stain to make an initial positive identification of magnesium bearing sepiolite clay.\nAbout the Pioche Sepiolite Project\nT\nhe Pioche Sepiolite Project claims are 100% owned by SR Minerals Inc. (\"SRM\"), a Nevada-registered and wholly owned subsidiary of Sunrise Resources plc. Tom Powell holds a 20% beneficial interest in the Project.\nThe Project is located in Lincoln County, Nevada, to the northeast of Pioche, a historic mining town just off US Route 93. The Company's mining claims are on Federally owned land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Access to rail is available at the town of Caliente, 35 miles south of the project area on Route 93.\nOriginally documented as a sepiolite occurrence in the 1970s, the occurrence was relocated by the Company in 2021. In 2022, Tolsa USA, Inc., a US subsidiary of Spanish sepiolite producer Tolsa SA, entered into an option to purchase agreement with the Company and explored the property until December 2024 when the option period expired.\nTolsa completed programmes of geological mapping, trenching, auger drilling and sonic drilling. This identified two (possibly three) sub-horizontal and extensive sepiolite beds outcropping intermittently along the margins of two mesas now known as the West and East Mesa areas.\nA silica rich caprock tops the sepiolite at the discovery location forming low mesas and flattened ridgetops.\nAbout Sepiolite\nSepiolite is a non-swelling, lightweight, porous hydrous magnesium silicate clay. It has unique characteristics, is scarce, and there are very few commercial deposits in the world.\nIn the US, a major use is in oil well drilling fluids primarily as a viscosifier and suspending agent, especially in saltwater or brine-based systems where other clays like bentonite are less effective. It has a high salt tolerance and maintains viscosity in saline or seawater environments where bentonite tends to flocculate and lose effectiveness. It also exhibits thixotropic behaviour forming gels when static, suspending drill cuttings and weighting materials such as barite, but thins out under shear, aiding in pumpability. It provides good rheological properties without adding a large amount of solid material, reducing the risk of formation damage. Sepiolite has high thermal stability and so is the only clay used in high temperature and high pressure wells.\nSepiolite is used in liquid animal feed supplements as a binder and carrier for nutrients and growth promoter. It is also used in building products such as drywall tape joint compounds, putty, caulk, texture coatings and asphalt emulsion coatings where freshwater viscosity is important.\nSepiolite possesses a high surface area due to channels in the crystal lattice that gives it a structural nano-porosity. Its unusual crystal shape also adds to the internal porosity and gives it a light weight. Sepiolite's high surface area and porosity account for sepiolite's outstanding sorption capacity. Just 20g of sepiolite can have an internal surface area equivalent to that of a football field and sepiolite can absorb more than its weight in water. The largest market globally for sepiolite is for use in light-weight non-clumping pet litters where it has superior properties compared to other clays used in this application.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

EPIC: \"SRES\".\nWebsite:\nwww.sunriseresourcesplc.com\nDetailed Information\nThe December 2025 field-work programme followed on from the July 2025 receipt of all remaining core samples from Tolsa's drill testing of the Pioche sepiolite deposit in 2024 and the Company's Phase 1 and 2 development testwork, details of which were reported in previous 2025 news announcements.\nThe field-work programme work was carried out by Mr Patrick Cheetham (geologist) and Mr Tom Powell, the Company's 20% partner in the project and an acknowledged expert on the processing and mining of industrial clays, especially sepiolite.\nThe first objective of the December 2025 field work was to locate and sample surface outcrops of high grade sepiolite for submission to potential partners for the project. This was carried out successfully and seven mini-bulk samples were collected across the project area.\nThe second objective was to review in detail the remaining \"core\" samples collected by Tolsa via sonic drilling and to select further samples for testing using the sample preparation techniques developed by Mr Powell which were previously reported in 2025.\nIt is clear from this review that Tolsa's sampling of core and subsequent testwork has been quite selective. Several additional and unsampled zones of sepiolite clay of varying grades were identified which have potential to add to the economic value of the deposit.\nAs a result of this core review a further 44 samples have been taken from the drill cores for further testing and for supply to interested parties",

We are very pleased to report continuing positive results and a breakthrough in processing Pioche sepiolite clay that has delivered results comparable to those obtained with high-grade Spanish sepiolite.\n\"Given that we have not yet been able to test higher-grade Pioche sepiolite samples, this is a great result. We are now gearing up bench-scale production of processed sepiolite to service demand from potential customers where, to date, we have only been able to provide raw clay samples to date.\"\nSepiolite is a naturally occurring, fibrous clay mineral (a hydrous magnesium silicate) that is rarely found in commercial quantities. On the Company's Pioche Project, sepiolite clays have been shown by drilling and surface sampling to occur at surface and at shallow depth over at least a 2.6 x 1.3km area with cumulative thicknesses up to several metres.\nSepiolite typically sells in the range US$150-800/ton with specialty surface treated grades commanding a value over US$1,800/ton.\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nAlbR Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nShares in the Company trade on AIM.

Attapulgite clay also serves this market but is mined in northern Florida, whereas the main oilfield markets are in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.\nVisible at a microscopic scale, sepiolite clay is comprised of elongated fibres or ribbons which when dispersed in fluids increase viscosity. Viscosity is measured in Centipoise (cP),\na unit of measurement for dynamic viscosity, which describes a fluid's resistance to flow. Liquids with higher centipoise values are thicker and flow more slowly, while those with lower values are thinner and flow more easily. For reference, water at 20 degrees centigrade has a viscosity of approximately 1cP, molasses 5-10,000cP.\nIn ",

An additional area, the Northeast Zone, presents a large additional target with surface dimensions of 1.3km by 0.6km with a drilled thickness of over 40m from surface.\nThe CS Project natural pozzolan is a supplementary cementitious material (\"SCM\"), a partial substitute for Portland cement in the production of green cements and concrete.\nThe Company wishes to advise that, as part of ongoing discussions with potential customers, the Company has now provided a truckload sample, approximately 25 tons of CS natural pozzolan, to a potentially large customer for testing and market trials. Further information will be provided should this result in a material agreement.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman, Patrick Cheetham said:\n\"We are now starting to see some momentum building in the supplementary cementitious materials space. This was led by Eco Material Technologies' investment in the Kirkland natural pozzolan mine in Arizona, followed by the acquisition of the Geofortis' natural pozzolan operation in Utah by Ash Grove Cement and most recently by the US$2.1 billion acquisition of Eco Material Technologies by global buildings material group, CRH.\n\"I think these transactions underline that this is the right time to be involved in the natural pozzolan business and we are now seeing increased retail investor speculation in this space as highlighted by the recent steep rise in the share price of LSE-listed Atlas Metals Group, which recently announced a proposed \u00a31 billion acquisition of an Australian pozzolan project.\"\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').

The Placing Price represents a discount of approximately 17.1 per cent. to the mid-market closing price of an Ordinary Share on 30 July 2025 (being the latest practicable date prior to this announcement).\nThe Company will also shortly be launching a retail offering to the Company's existing shareholders to raise up to an additional \u00a350,000 through the issue of up to a further 294,117,647 new ordinary shares (the \"WRAP\u00a0Retail\u00a0Offer\u00a0Shares\") at the Placing Price.\nThe Placing\nThe Placing was arranged through the Company's broker, Peterhouse Capital Limited (\"Peterhouse\").\nMr Patrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman of the Company, has subscribed \u00a350,000 for 294,117,647 Placing Shares and Mr Adam Hainsworth, a non-executive director of the Company has subscribed \u00a330,000 for 176,470,588 Placing Shares as part of the Placing. Mr\u00a0Cheetham's and Mr Hainsworth's participation in the Placing constitute related party actions under AIM Rule 13. The independent director of the Company (being Mr James Cole), having consulted with Beaumont Cornish Limited, the Company's nominated adviser, considers that the terms of their participation in the Placing are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nFollowing the issue of the Placing Shares, Mr Cheetham will be beneficially interested in\n685,761,926 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 10.22% of the Company's enlarged issued share capital and Mr Hainsworth will be beneficially interested in 325,738,372 representing approximately 4.85% of the Company's enlarged issued share capital.\nHalf of the amount raised by the Placing has been invested by a single institutional shareholder, a new investor in the Company.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman Patrick Cheetham said:\n\"Both myself and Mr Hainsworth are pleased to continue our financial support for the Company as we believe that the Company's assets are substantially undervalued by the market and that patient shareholders will be rewarded. We are also delighted to welcome a significant new institutional shareholder to the Company who shares the Board's vision for the Company.\"\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net funds raised will be applied to general working capital and to support the Company's plans for advancement of the Company's mineral projects.\nAdmission\nThe issue of the Placing Shares is conditional only on Admission. Application is being made for the Placing Shares, which will rank\npari passu\nwith all existing ordinary shares,to be admitted to trading on AIM and Admission is expected to occur on or around 6\u00a0August 2025.\nThe Retail Offer\nThe Company is pleased to announce that a retail offer to existing shareholders will be shortly launched via the Winterford Retail Access Platform (\"WRAP\"), to raise up to an additional \u00a350,000 (the \"WRAP\u00a0Retail\u00a0Offer\"), through the issue of up to 294,117,647 WRAP Retail Offer Shares, at the Placing Price.\nThe proceeds of the WRAP Retail Offer will be utilised in the same way as the proceeds of the Placing. For the avoidance of doubt, the WRAP Retail Offer is not part of the Placing. Completion of the WRAP Retail Offer is conditional,\ninter alia\n, upon the completion of the Placing, but completion of the Placing is not conditional on the completion of the WRAP Retail Offer. The WRAP Retail Offer is conditional on the WRAP Retail Offer Shares being admitted to trading on AIM.\nThe Company values its shareholder base and believes that it is appropriate to provide its existing retail shareholders in the United Kingdom the opportunity to participate in its fundraising.\nThe WRAP Retail Offer is expected to close at\u00a010.00am on Friday 1 August.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFor the purposes of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Board of Sunrise hereby notifies the market that further to Admission of the Placing Shares, the Company's issued share capital will consist of 6,709,472,747 Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of 0.001p each, with voting rights (\"Ordinary Shares\"). The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in Treasury. Therefore, the total number of Ordinary Shares in the Company with voting rights will be 6,709,472,747. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as denominator for the calculations by which they may determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nP",

(\"Tolsa\"), during the period it held the project under option from the Company (June 2022 to December 2024). The samples have a cumulative weight of approximately one tonne and have been shipped from Tolsa's head office in Spain. The samples come from surface trenching and two periods of drilling using auger and sonic drill rigs.\nThe sepiolite samples will now be used for additional in-house testing by the Company's partner in the project, Tom Powell, an expert in sepiolite, and to provide material to various parties who have expressed interest in the Pioche Project since Tolsa's withdrawal from the project at the end of 2024.\nThe results from Company's work on a small subset of samples shipped in advance of the main consignment were reported in a news release dated 15 April 2025. Those results compare very favourably with commercially available sepiolite in the US and confirm the commercial potential of the large sepiolite clay deposits at Pioche across a range of applications including critical saltwater applications in the valuable oil and gas drilling market.\nSince then, the Company has carried out 3D modelling of the sepiolite horizons drilled by Tolsa. This work has demonstrated that the main sepiolite horizon can be correlated between drill holes, despite their wide spacing.\nA drill plan and schematic drill cross sections can be found at the end of this news release, illustrating the large near surface extent of the main sepiolite horizon and a second, lower sepiolite horizon, seen only in deeper drill holes.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman Patrick Cheetham said:\n\"It has taken rather longer than anticipated to obtain these samples, but we are now able to move our discussions with interested parties to the next stage.\n\"We are very encouraged to see a high level of interest in the Project from both US domestic companies, as well as international industrial mineral companies and feel that Tolsa's work has added substantially to the value of the Project over and above the US$1.2 million option purchase price that was first agreed with Tolsa back in 2022, prior to any exploration taking place.\"\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nShares in the Company trade on AIM.

In the six months to 30 March 2025 \u00a32,135 was spent on the Project.\nThe Option Agreement allows the Optioner to conduct exploration on the Project area during the Option Period and contains the customary clauses relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, insurance and governing law etc.\nShould the Optioner elect to purchase the Project then the parties will enter into a contract for the sale of the Project. Any such sale will be considered a Substantial Transaction as defined in the AIM Rules for Companies and further information will be provided to shareholders at that time.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman Patrick Cheetham said:\n\"We have been discussing the Hazen project with the Optioner for some time, so we are pleased to bring these talks to fruition. Should the option be exercised, the proceeds will be used for additional working capital and the further advancement of the Company's project portfolio.\n\"Hazen is an early stage project and so non-core for Sunrise Resources.

Pumice is currently mined elsewhere in the US and at Hazen, pumice was mined some decades ago as a lightweight aggregate from a shallow open pit.\nWhilst the Hazen Project is less advanced than the CS Project, the Company's laboratory testwork to date has shown that the material present in the pit is of similar high quality to the CS Project.\nThe Hazen pumice has the additional property that it is lightweight and so it will also be evaluated for its potential as a lightweight aggregate for use in lightweight concrete blocks and facing stones.\nFurther work is required to determine the extent of the Hazen deposit although indications are that the pumice extends several hundred meters beyond the limits of the existing open pit.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Excha",

The Second Convertible Security issued under the Deed currently has an amount outstanding of \u00a3123,000. No further Convertible Securities will be issued under the Deed.\nThe Deed has now been further amended by a Second Deed of Amendment (the \"Second Amendment\").\nSecond Amendment\nUnder the Second Amendment a number of changes have been made to the Deed, primarily to extend the Maturity Date term of the Second Convertible Security but also to incorporate a number of other changes that are generally more favourable to Sunrise and which are designed to ensure the continuing and orderly operation of the Deed in the current market conditions.\nMost importantly, the Maturity Date, being the date any outstanding balance would become convertible, has been extended by 18 months to 7 December 2026. Furthermore, no conversions will be permitted in the next three months unless the trading volume exceeds a certain threshold.\nThe Deed has also been amended to give the Company the option, exercisable once per month, to make penalty-free repayments up to \u00a310,000 each month.\nThe conversion pricing formula is set out in the November and June Announcements and the rounding factor referred to therein has been reduced in the Company's favour by a factor of ten when the number being rounded is less than or equal to 0.01pence.\nFinally, if a conversion would result in the effective discount to the prevailing market price of the Company's shares being in excess of 25%, the conversion price will be increased by half of such excess.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained w",

The newly reported high-grade samples are from epithermal veins that are consistently oriented along WNW-ESE trending structures.\nIn the nearby \"High-Grade Zone\", around half of which is within the Garfield Royalty Area, previously reported copper-magnetite-skarn mineralisation is focused at the margins of a granitic intrusion. Follow up work reported by GMR today at the High-Grade Zone has observed structures, veins and, notably, hydrothermal breccias having the same WNW orientation, directly along strike from the Freeze Zone. Maps released by GMR today show gold values up 27.2g/t from the High-Grade Zone within the Sunrise Garfield Royalty Area.\nGMR is now investigating whether epithermal-style precious metal mineralisation has overprinted the broader Cu-skarn mineralisation at both the High-Grade Zone and, to the NW, the Power Line Zone (which lies wholly within the Garfield Royalty Area) along a 6km long trend extending ESE to the Freeze Zone.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman Patrick Cheetham said:\n\"The original discovery of gold-copper-silver at surface at Garfield was made by Sunrise prior to selling the project mining claims. Sunrise has retained a 2% NSR royalty over the original claim area and a 1-mile surrounding area.\n\"NSR royalty interests such as this are risk free as they are payable from future revenue and not exposed to profitability. Furthermore, they are free carried and so, as holder, we are not required to contribute to exploration or mine development costs. Royalty interests also have a ready market amongst numerous specialist royalty holding companies. The Garfield royalty is just one of a number of royalty interests held by the Company and built into our agreements with other parties.\"\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nAbout Reach Announcements\nThis is a Reach announcement.

However, since February 2025 the main operational activity has been at the\nPioche Project\nin Nevada, USA.\nPioche Sepiolite\nSepiolite is a rare but important speciality clay used mainly for its gelling and absorbing properties.\n\u00b7\nData package received from Tolsa covering the results of work undertaken since exploration began in 2022, including:\n\u00d8\nGeological mapping, trenching, surface sampling, auger drilling (20 holes drilled in 2023) and sonic drilling (10 holes drilled in 2024).\n\u00d8\nTesting results for samples from the above field programmes.\n\u00b7\nData review has been completed with the following conclusions:\n\u00d8\nExtensive sepiolite beds have been discovered over an area of 2.6km x 1.3km with samples containing up to 92% sepiolite.\n\u00d8\n3-D modelling by the Company has demonstrated that the sepiolite beds are continuous across this project area at or near surface, so suitable for open pit mining with low strip ratios.\n\u00d8\nOuter limits of sepiolite deposit not yet defined.\n\u00d8\nWhilst drilling has demonstrated continuity of sepiolite beds, drill spacing is too wide (average c.\u00a0300m) for effective correlation of specific sepiolite grades.\n\u00d8\nSepiolite morphology (important for commercial properties) is similar to that found in the IMV sepiolite mine in the Amargosa Valley, Nevada, albeit different to Tolsa's Spanish sepiolite.\n\u00b7\nExtensive testing programme initiated to simulate processing methods employed for commercial sepiolite production in the US. Early results:\n\u00d8\ncompare very favourably with commercially available sepiolite in the US;\n\u00d8\nconfirm the commercial potential of Pioche sepiolite across a range of applications including critical saltwater applications in the valuable oil and gas drilling market (not evaluated by Tolsa).\n\u00b7\nTiming for new market entrant is favourable due to:\n\u00d8\nExpectation of a strong increase in oil/gas well drilling activity under the Trump Administration.\n\u00d8\nThe existential environmental threats to the Amargosa Valley sepiolite mine, the only producer of sepiolite in the USA.\nFinancial Results Summary\n\u00b7\nGroup loss for the six-months ended 31 March 2025 of \u00a3147,902 comprising:\n\u00d8\nOther income of \u00a31,968.\n\u00d8\nInterest income of \u00a317; less Administration costs of \u00a3144,781.\n\u00d8\nExpensed pre-licence exploration costs totalling \u00a31,443.\n\u00d8\nImpairment adjustment (credit) of \u00a33,663.\n\u00b7\nProject expenditure of \u00a35,494 was capitalised.\nFunding during the period\nFunds of US$75,000 (GBP \u00a358,080) were received in November 2024 as the second instalment from the sale of the Crow Springs Diatomite claims and US$59,452 (GBP \u00a346,040) was received in December 2024 as a bond refund from the Bureau of Land Management for the CS Pozzolan-Perlite Project.\nShares to the value of \u00a319,069 were issued in March 2025 in satisfaction of a portion of outstanding directors' fees. In addition, amounts of \u00a345,000 and \u00a327,000 were settled in shares on the partial conversion of convertible securities in November 2024 and February 2025, respectively.\nOn 31 March 2025, the Company held \u00a391,730 in cash and cash equivalents and liquid listed investments having a value of \u00a36,329.\nThe Company relies upon periodic capital fundraisings until such time as cashflow can be derived either from the sale of assets or future operations.\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nCAUTIONARY NOTICE\nThe news release may contain certain statements and expressions of belief, expectation or opinion which are forward looking statements, and which relate, inter alia, to the Company's proposed strategy, plans and objectives or to the expectations or intentions of the Company's directors.

They allow us to demonstrate - for the first time - the suitability of Pioche sepiolite for the US market when suitably processed. The results should help dispel any uncertainties that surrounded the Project following Tolsa's decision not to exercise its option to purchase the Project at the end of last year, a decision that may\nultimately work in the Company's favour.\n\"Sepiolite is very rare in commercial quantities but has now been found at Pioche in surface sampling and drilling over several square kilometres. With the only other US sepiolite producer facing severe environmental restrictions, Pioche now presents an opportunity to develop a new replacement source of sepiolite in the US.\n\"The largest single market for sepiolite is in oil and gas well drilling, a market not served by Tolsa. We believe the Project could be a beneficiary of\u00a0planned US policies to increase domestic oil and gas drilling as a way to reduce reliance on\u00a0foreign energy sources and therefore, the Project is now\u00a0generating interest from a range of consumers and other clay producers.\n\"We expect to receive all of the remaining drill samples from Tolsa over the next several weeks and to continue engagement with the industry to the find the best development option for the Company.\"\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').

EPIC: \"SRES\". Website: www.sunriseresourcesplc.com\nDetailed Information\nThe Pioche Sepiolite Project is located near the historic mining town of Pioche in southeastern Nevada, USA. The Project was held under option by Spanish sepiolite producer, Tolsa, from June 2022 to the end of December 2024. Tolsa carried out mapping, trenching and two phases of drilling prior to withdrawing from the Project at the end of 2024.\nIn the United States, sepiolite is primarily used for its viscosity modification (gelling) properties in freshwater and saltwater applications (see \"About Sepiolite\" below). Viscosity testing is therefore critical to assessing the commercial potential of the Pioche sepiolite. The testwork programme now being reported was designed and executed by Mr Tom Powell. Mr Powell is a chemical engineer and was formerly the General Manager of the IMV sepiolite mine in the Amargosa Valley, Nevada, the only producing sepiolite mine in the US.

The latter is long seen as an imbalance that may be a sign that the silver price is due a major upward correction.\n\"The record-breaking gold price has been driven by economic uncertainties, central bank buying, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East, as well as U.S. trade policies\u200b. There is also a market move away from assets with counterparty risk to ownership of physical assets. Most commentators expect the gold price to remain strong for some time to come and the silver price to rise further.\n\"We hold our precious metal projects as available for sale or joint venture whilst we focus on progressing our industrial minerals projects but I think it is timely that the Company highlights to investors, shareholders and potential partners the extent of our portfolio of precious metal projects as the value inherent in these projects is often overlooked. All are drill ready and most are owned 100% by the Company without underlying royalty or other interests.\"\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nNote: The following highlights are based entirely on previously announced information.\nPROJECT HIGHLIGHTS\nClayton Silver-Gold Project, Nevada (Status: Drill Ready, 100% owned)\n\u00b7\nTargeting Epithermal Ag-Au Replacement Deposit.\n\u00b7\nSignificant silver intersections in historic and Company drilling with a number of holes ending in mineralisation:\n\u00b7\nMost recent Company results:\n\u00d8\nDrill core from a 7.92m mineralised interval graded 303 g/t (8.84 ounces/ton) silver and 0.2 g/t gold (from 82.30m down hole\n\u00d8\nIncludes 4.27m interval grading 408 g/t (11.89 ounces/ton) silver and 0.23 g/t gold from 83.82m depth.\n\u00d8\n84% higher silver grade in hole 20CLDD001 compared to twinned 1980s-hole CL-15 which reported 7.62m grading 165 g/t silver (4.8 ounces/ton) and 0.4 g/t gold.\n.\n\u00d8\nMineralised interval contains sulphide bearing vein quartz and quartz breccia over the down hole drilled interval of 7.92m from 82.3m depth (true thickness - as yet unknown).\n\u00b7\nHistoric grades were likely understated due to loss of fine silver-bearing sulphide minerals during the RC drilling programme.\nNewark Gold Project, Nevada (Status: Drill Ready, 100% owned)\n\u00b7\nTargeting Carlin-style gold mineralisation which includes some of the largest gold deposits in the world, almost exclusively found in Nevada.\n\u00b7\nFavourably located at intersection of the Alligator Ridge and Battle Mountain-Eureka gold trends.\n\u00b7\nHistoric surface sampling returned anomalous gold with high values of Carlin-style geochemical indicator elements arsenic, antimony, thallium and barium.\n\u00b7\nA major silicified structure is associated with favourable north-south striking anticline \"trap\".\n\u00b7\nReconnaissance Hole NWK8 drilled in 1986 intersected 47m of gold-anomalous jasperoid containing an average 0.14 ppm gold from 75m to the end of hole at 122m.\n\u00b7\nDeeper drilling is required to test the favourable target horizons.\nReese Ridge Zn-Ag-Pb-Ga Project, Nevada (Status: Drill ready, 100% owned)\n\u00b7\nLocated on south side of prospective Humboldt Structural Zone, at north end of Shoshone Mountains, 52 miles south-southwest of Battle Mountain, Nevada.\n\u00b7\nDrill ready ZTEM geophysical anomaly with overlying high grade oxide/carbonate zinc mineralisation, a target of carbonate replacement style mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nHigh grade zinc, lead and silver samples in outcrops over wide area: e.g.\n\u00d8\n20.0% lead, 4.5% zinc, 383g/t silver\n\u00d8\n3.6% zinc, 12.8% lead, 146 ppm silver\n\u00d8\n29.6% zinc, 0.3% lead, 7 ppm silver\n\u00d8\n15.9% zinc, 0.5% lead, 17 ppm silver\n\u00b7\nSignificant gallium contents up to 68ppm. Gallium is a strategic metal whose supply is monopolised by China.\nBay State Silver Project Nevada, (Status: Drill ready, Lease Option to Purchase)\n\u00b7\nHistorical silver production from 900m long Chihuahua Vein system.\n\u00b7\nHigh-grade silver mineralisation was encountered in three of five drill holes completed by the Company:\n\u00d8\n1,460 g/t silver (42.6 oz/ton) over 0.2m from 164.13m in Hole 15SRDD002\n\u00d8\n566 g/t silver (16.5 oz/ton) over 0.5m from 70.71m in Hole 15SRDD001\n\u00d8\n503 g/t silver (14.7 oz/ton) over 1.4m from 185.32m in Hole 15SRDD003\n\u00b7\nThe silver bearing vein zones are characterised by silicification, sulphide mineralisation (galena and tetrahedrite) and staining with secondary copper minerals.\n\u00b7\nA fourth hole has demonstrated continuity of the Chihuahua Vein System at 300m below the surface but did not penetrate the vein sufficiently well to obtain reliable grade information.\n\u00b7\nThe results are considered to be highly encouraging and justify further drilling.\nBaker's Gold Project, Aus",

He will be sorely missed for the valuable advice he has given to the Board and management over a long period, but we wish him all the very best going forward.\"\nCommenting on his retirement Mr Murphy said:\n\"The QCA Code recommends that non-executive directors do not serve more than nine years and family and other business interests are also pushing me to free up time.

Mr Cole has performed an important service to the Company for which he has received limited remuneration and made frequent and prolonged salary sacrifices, as have all directors.\nThe Board will continue to engage with shareholders to better understand the motivation behind the vote and explain the important role of independent non-executive directors.\nResolution 4\nResolution 4 is a general shareholder authority to issue new shares. This resolution is never popular amongst shareholders who, understandably, do not wish to see shareholder dilution. However, the Company has no regular income and so the passing of Resolution 4 allows the Company to raise fresh capital. The authority granted by Resolution 4 does, however, limit the number of shares that can be issued and only rarely has the authority been used in full.\nThe Directors will continue to balance the use of the facility with their duty to ensure that the Company is able to continue as a going concern and advance its business. The Directors have managed to limit the amount of funds raised through new share issues during the last financial year through the sale of a non-core project, securing future royalty rights at the same time. This policy will continue in 2025.\nResolution 5\nThis allows the Company to carry out fundraisings other than through a rights issue to all shareholders. Rights issues can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for smaller fundraises and they tend to have a low level of success when the share price is volatile. Furthermore, many shareholders hold their shares in broker nominee accounts which can complicate their participation in rights issues.\nShareholder can, however, feel disenfranchised by this resolution. In order to address this concern, the Company will, provided sufficient shareholder demand is communicated to the Company, consider provided a facility for shareholders to participate in fundraisings, alongside and on the same terms as any future share placing, through their broker (a \"Broker Option\").\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\n",

He was formerly General Manager of the Amargosa Valley sepiolite mining operations for IMV. Mr. Powell works with the Company on 20% Finders fee basis in connection with any income received by the Company from parties he introduces to the Company.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman Patrick Cheetham said:\n\"Our expenditure on this project is less than US$60,000 but it has so far returned US$150,000 in option fees and the project has benefited from several hundred thousand dollars of third-party, non-dilutive expenditure.\n\"The data we now hold confirms that Tolsa located large quantities of sepiolite clay over a wide and open-ended area. Tolsa's drilling, although widely spaced, has defined priority target areas having potential for future resource definition and a great springboard for anyone picking up the baton for the further development of this project.\n\"The only producing sepiolite deposit in the USA, in the Amargosa Valley, Nevada has successfully served the US sepiolite market since the 1970s, first under Gulf Resources ownership, then under Rio Tinto's ownership, and most recently under the control of global lime producer Lhoist, but it now faces an existential threat from encroaching Areas of Critical Environmental Concern.\n\"This paves the way for a new entrant to the US sepiolite market with new parties showing interest in the Pioche Project now that Tolsa is no longer involved.\"\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nShares in the Company trade on AIM.

Beaumont Cornish is not acting for and will not be responsible to any other persons for providing protections afforded to customers of Beaumont Cornish nor for advising them in relation to the proposed arrangements described in this announcement or any matter referred to in it.\nQualified Person Information:\nThe information in this release has been compiled and reviewed by Mr. Patrick Cheetham (MIMMM, MAusIMM) who is a qualified person for the purposes of the AIM Note for Mining and Oil & Gas Companies. Mr. Cheetham is a Member of the Institute of Materials, Minerals & Mining and also a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy.\nChairman's Statement\nDear Shareholders,\nI am pleased to present your Annual Report for 2024 which covers the financial year ended 30\u00a0September 2024 and significant post year-end developments.\nThe Company's strategy is to identify, acquire and explore projects at low cost where value can be added quickly and cheaply. With one exception, our projects are located in mining friendly Nevada, USA, and include industrial mineral projects as well as more conventional gold and base-metal projects.\nIndustrial mineral producers are generally not good explorers and so we are exploiting a niche opportunity to identify and explore potential new industrial mineral deposits and then partner with specialist industrial mineral producers to generate cash flow and future royalty interests that will provide a long-term sustaining cash flow for the Company.\nSince the start of the year, this strategy has generated income of US$185,000 during the reporting period and a further US$75,000 after the financial year-end from various project payments offsetting a significant part of our administration costs and reducing the requirement for equity fundraising.\nAs of the date of this report, the Company holds interests in three key industrial mineral projects, a number of royalty interests, and various base and precious metal projects, details of which can be found in the Operating Review.\nNatural Pozzolan-Perlite Projects\nThe Company holds two natural pozzolan deposits in Nevada at the CS and Hazen projects.\nThe natural pozzolan deposits that underpin the CS Project, including perlite deposits, were discovered by the Company and secured by low-cost claim staking. The Company has taken this project through drilling, testwork and mine permitting with a total expenditure to year-end of just US$1.7million. This is a notable achievement especially when considered in the usual time frame for discovery and mine permitting which typically takes ten years or more.\nIn normal circumstances, substantial value is added through the definition of minable deposits and the completion of mine permitting, but realisation of this value has yet to be achieved for shareholders. This is due in large part to a slower than anticipated uptake of natural pozzolan, but the direction of travel we laid out in detail in the 2023 annual report remains clear, and is driven by the need to produce cement and concrete with less embodied carbon.\nThe lack of material news in 2024 for our pozzolan-perlite projects belies the efforts being made by the Company to secure routes to development. We are currently in discussions with four groups regarding possibilities for the sale or j",

(\"Tolsa\") has, at the last minute, notified the Company that it will not proceed to exercise its option to purchase the Company's Pioche Sepiolite Project in Nevada USA. Tolsa has, however, suggested it is open to discuss alternative arrangements for the project.\nThe option was originally granted on 28 June 2022 and was extended for an additional 12 months as announced on 27 December 2023. Until very recently, the parties had been negotiating more detailed agreements to govern the terms of calculation and payment of the agreed 3% royalty that would have been payable to Sunrise and the conveyance of the project claims. However, these negotiations were not concluded and there was no agreement on the terms for calculation and verification of the production royalty.\nDuring contract negotiations Tolsa indicated that, whilst large deposits of sepiolite clay have been defined by the wide spaced drilling carried out to-date at Pioche, it has been difficult to correlate specific sepiolite grades (and so values) between drill holes. The Company has not been able to verify this as, despite requesting Tolsa to provide the project data, Tolsa has, so far, provided only basic data from its earlier programmes and no data from its 2025 exploration and testing programme.\nThe Company has been advised that sepiolite deposits in Nevada differ significantly in origin and character from those exploited in Tolsa's existing operations in Spain and that we should not expect to see correlation of specific sepiolite grades between the widely spaced holes drilled to date.\nThe Company has been advised throughout, and continues to be advised, by Mr Tom Powell who was formerly General Manager of the IMV Nevada sepiolite clay mining operations in Nevada and has over 30 years' experience in industrial minerals, focusing on specialty clays.\nThe Company will ensure that Tolsa meets its contractual obligations to supply the detailed project data and remaining exploration samples.\nThe Company is now free to market the project to other parties some of whom have already expressed interest in the project.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman Patrick Cheetham said:\n\"Given these circumstances, we do not see Tolsa's decision as a reflection on the value of the project. Tolsa has expressed interest in alternative arrangements for the project and has already stated that a large deposits of sepiolite clay have been identified at Pioche. We expect to be in a position to verify this soon and take possession of all remaining samples from the project.\n\"We look forward to providing further information to shareholders and other interested parties once this becomes available. Tolsa has paid us US$150,000 in option fees to date, whilst our expenditure on the Pioche Project, at around \u00a350,000, is just a small fraction of the money we believe has been spent by Tolsa to date in evaluating the project and from which we stand to benefit.\"\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nShares in the Company trade on AIM.

An additional area, the Northeast Zone, presents a large additional target for natural pozzolan. Pozzolan extraction from the CS Project is aimed at the cement and concrete markets of southern California.\nThe Hazen Project is an earlier stage project and is located close to Reno in northern Nevada and pozzolan extraction from this project is expected to serve markets in northern Nevada and northern California.\nFor some time now, the Company has been in discussions with various groups with the objective of securing investment and material offtake agreements for the development of both projects. These discussions usually involve extensive testing programmes to evaluate the performance of a specific pozzolan when blended with proprietary cements and/or cement blends.\nCurrently, discussions and testwork are progressing with four separate groups:\n\u00b7\na large multinational cement company that has extensive cement and ready-mix businesses in the western USA. Discussions with this company originated some time ago and have recently been revived with renewed testwork in progress aimed at introducing the Company's natural pozzolans into its ready-mix products.\n\u00b7\nan existing multinational industrial minerals producer looking to produce various cementitious materials for the mining industry. This company has completed initial due diligence testwork and a due diligence field visit to the CS Project.\n\u00b7\nan established industrial minerals company which is considering use of our natural pozzolan as a beneficial additive to their existing planned production of cementitious materials and is continuing its testwork programme. Initial testwork was successful and a 25-ton bulk sample has been requested for grinding testwork and to produce samples for customer evaluation.\n\u00b7\na private group looking for opportunities to establish a new natural pozzolan grinding facility in Nevada. Testwork is nearing completion.\nThe nature of the discussions, and possible deal structures, are different in each case, reflecting the different objectives of the interested parties. Ongoing discussions have included simple offtake arrangements, joint production arrangements and the outright sale of the projects. Some discussions relate to just one of the pozzolan projects, others to both.\nCommenting today, Executive Chairman, Patrick Cheetham, said:\n\"We are pleased to provide this update for our natural pozzolan projects. In all of our discussions with interested parties our natural pozzolan is one part of a larger jigsaw where those parties are evaluating multiple strategies and raw materials from different sources to produce blended cements and concrete with lower embodied carbon. Their testing programmes and due diligence programmes are time consuming, repetitious and sometimes intermittent, which I know is equally frustrating for shareholders, as it is for management. Nevertheless, the consistent feedback is that our natural pozzolan is of the highest quality and we remain confident that we will achieve a positive outcome.\"\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').

Diatoms have hollow and lattice-like silica skeletons and the mass accumulation of these skeletons during algal blooms forms a rock with very high porosity.\nAfter processing, which can include heating to a high temperature (calcining) to improve quality, diatomite is used, for example, in filtering beer, liquor, wine, fats, fruit juices, and solvents. Commercial deposits of diatomite have a high brightness, a low bulk density and chemical inertness which also make it a suitable filler or carrier material in various industrial and domestic products.\nAbout Dicalite\nDicalite Management Group is a vertically integrated international industrial minerals company founded in 1928.

This new area is some distance from the previously reported high-grade samples, but all of these samples lie above the large low resistivity zone that has been defined as a primary drill target for CRD mineralisation by the Company's interpretation of historical airborne geophysical surveys. CRD style mineralisation is an attractive target as economic deposits tend to be large and high-grade. New discoveries of CRD style mineralisation include the Ruby Hill deposits near Eureka in Nevada and the now producing Taylor deposit in the adjacent state of Arizona.\n\"Given the scale of the opportunity presented at Reese Ridge it makes sense that the Board considers Reese Ridge to be a priority asset for exploration alongside the commercialisation of our high-quality industrial mineral assets. Further work could include ground geophysics and drilling as resources allow.\"\nDetailed Information\nThe Company's wholly owned Reese Ridge Project is located on the south side of the prospective Humboldt Structural Zone, 52 miles south-southwest of Battle Mountain, Nevada.\nThe project covers a ridge-forming fault-bounded horst block of limestones/shales fault-juxtaposed against younger shales all bounded to the east and west by Tertiary age volcano-sedimentary basins.\nThe limestone is host to numerous conspicuous iron-rich gossans derived from massive and semi-massive sulphides which also attracted the Company's attention and that of early prospectors looking for silver. These gossans have exotic geochemistry and consistently anomalous zinc, lead and silver with values up to 6.8% zinc, 3.3% lead and 51g/t silver. Forty-three samples taken from these gossans and old workings averaged 0.86% zinc.\nSubsequently, prospecting by the Company yielded a sample of unremarkable limestone containing a few spots of the lead sulphide mineral galena and a high-grade analysis of 15.9% zinc (alongside 0.3% lead and 17ppm silver). Follow-up sampling yielded high-grade samples containing up to 29.6% zinc, 0.3% lead, 7ppm silver, 68ppm gallium. These high-grade samples tend to be iron-poor in comparison and the zinc is contained as oxide and/or carbonate minerals that are difficult to identify in the field in an area where the rocks are significantly altered and do not have the stand-out characteristics of iron-rich gossans and are easily overlooked.\nRecently, in July, the Company contracted geological consultants, Big Rock Exploration, to carry out a 3-day field reconnaissance programme using a pXRF analyser to gather real-time field information on the zinc, lead and silver levels across different parts of the project area. Extreme summer temperatures were experienced during the fieldwork (+40oC) which adversely affected the operation of the pXRF and the accuracy of readings. The pXRF did, however, help direct the collection of field samples for subsequent laboratory geochemical analysis.\nLaboratory analytical results are now available and have highlighted an area some 260m west of the previously identified high-grade samples where two rock samples yielded very high lead, zinc and silver results as follows:\n\u00d8\n+24.5% combined lead-zinc and 383g/t silver in sample 24RR-AL19.\n(4.5% zinc and greater than 20% lead, the upper instrument detection limit for the chosen analytical method)\n\u00d8\n18.6% combined zinc-lead and 51g/t silver in sample 24RR-AL18.\n(11.7% zinc and 6.9% lead)\nSample 24RR-AL18 was taken from an old mine dump whereas sample 24RR-AL19 was taken from a rock outcrop (see Photos 1 & 2 following). Outcrop in the project area is generally very poor due to the extensive scree deposits.\nConsiste",

Beaumont Cornish is not acting for and will not be responsible to any other persons for providing protections afforded to customers of Beaumont Cornish nor for advising them in relation to the proposed arrangements described in this announcement or any matter referred to in it.\nAbout Sepiolite\nSepiolite is a very uncommon clay because of both its peculiar characteristics and scarce occurrence. It is non-swelling, lightweight and highly porous. There are very few commercial deposits in the world.\nIt is used extensively in pet litter, in agriculture as a slow-release absorbent and adsorbent, as a carrier for chemicals and pesticides and in animal feeds as a binder and carrier for nutrients and growth promoter. It is also a valuable gelling agent and viscosity modifier in several industrial products.\nSepiolite, unlike other clays, is not affected by salt water and so sepiolite drilling muds are used in oil field wells where brine formations are a problem. It is also the only clay that is stable at high temperatures and so is used in drilling muds for geothermal wells. Sepiolite is usually mined by open pit methods and is processed by drying, grinding and screening and may undergo further treatments and transformations depending on the market.\nAbout the Pioche Sepiolite Project\nThe Pioche Sepiolite Project (the \"Project\") is located close to the historic mining town of Pioche in Lincoln County, Nevada. It lies within 4km of US Highway 93, from which it can be accessed by a network of 4WD tracks, and 47km from rail at the town of Caliente, Nevada. The Project was acquired at low cost by claim staking.\nIn the summer of 2023, Tolsa carried out a drill programme at the Project (Phase 1). Twenty drill holes were competed for a total of 929.5 linear ft. Holes were drilled to an average depth of 47ft reflecting the shallow occurrence of sepiolite amenable to open-pit mining. The drill holes were spaced relatively evenly over an area of 2km x 1.1km. A helical drill stem was used to extract the samples and good recovery was achieved.\nTolsa may purchase the Project for US$1.4 million at any time before 28 December 2024 and has paid US$150,000 in option fees to date. Sunrise will retain a 3% net revenue royalty for a 25-year period from the commencement of commercial production should Tolsa exercise its option.\nFurther information on the Pioche Project can be found on the Company's website at:\nhttps://www.sunriseresourcesplc.com/pioche-sepiolite-project\n.\nFurther information on the Compa",

(\"Tolsa\"), a subsidiary of Spanish sepiolite producer, Tolsa S.A., the world's largest sepiolite producer.\nTolsa holds an option to purchase the Pioche project for US$1.4 million exercisable by 28\u00a0December 2024 with future payments to Sunrise of a 3% revenue-based royalty on production.\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR'). Upon the publication of this announcement via Regulatory Information Service ('RIS'), this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nNominated Adviser\nBeaumont Cornish Limited (\"Beaumont Cornish\") is the Company's Nominated Adviser and is authorised and regulated by the FCA. Beaumont Cornish's responsibilities as the Company's Nominated Adviser, including a responsibility to advise and guide the Company on its responsibilities under the AIM Rules for Companies and AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers, are owed solely to the London Stock Exchange. Beaumont Cornish is not acting for and will not be responsible to any other persons for providing protections afforded to customers of Beaumont Cornish nor for advising them in relation to the proposed arrangements described in this announcement or any matter referred to in it.\nAbout Sepiolite\nSepiolite is a very uncommon clay because of both its peculiar characteristics and scarce occurrence. It is non-swelling, lightweight and highly porous. There are very few commercial deposits in the world.\nIt is used extensively in pet litter, in agriculture as a slow-release absorbent and adsorbent, as a carrier for chemicals and pesticides and in animal feeds as a binder and carrier for nutrients and growth promoter. It is also a valuable gelling agent and viscosity modifier in several industrial products.\nSepiolite, unlike other clays, is not affected by salt water and so sepiolite drilling muds are used in oil field wells where brine formations are a problem. It is also the only clay that is stable at high temperatures and so is used in drilling muds for geothermal wells. Sepiolite is usually mined by open pit methods and is processed by drying, grinding and screening and may undergo further treatments and transformations depending on the market.\nAbout the Pioche Sepiolite Project\nThe Pioche Sepiolite Project (the \"Project\") is located close to the historic mining town of Pioche in Lincoln County, Nevada. It lies within 4km of US Highway 93, from which it can be accessed by a network of 4WD tracks, and 47km from rail at the town of Caliente, Nevada. The Project was acquired at low cost by claim staking.\nIn the summer of 2023, Tolsa carried out a drill programme at the Project (Phase 1). Twenty drill holes were competed for a total of 929.5 linear ft. Holes were drilled to an average depth of 47ft reflecting the shallow occurrence of sepiolite amenable to open-pit mining. The drill holes were spaced relatively evenly over an area of 2km x 1.1km. A helical drill stem was used to extract the samples and good recovery was achieved.\nThe Phase 1 drill programme confirmed two main levels of medium-high grade sepiolite clay over a wide area and 166 samples were collected and shipped to Tolsa's laboratories in Madrid for testing.\nThe approved Phase 2 drill programme will comprise 13 sonic boreholes, each to a maximum of 130ft deep. In addition, 300m of trenches will be completed in three large trenches for collection of larger sample volumes.\nTolsa may purchase the Project for US$1.4 million at any time before 28 December 2024 and has paid US$150,000 in option fees to date. Sunrise will retain a 3% net revenue royalty for a 25-year period from the commencement of commercial production should Tolsa exercise its option.\nFurther information on the Pi",

The Fundraise Price is equal to the market bid price at market close on Friday 28 June 2024.\nThe Fundraise comprises a conditional placing (the \"Placing\") of 279,000,000 new Ordinary Shares and a direct subscription to the Company (the \"Subscription\") of 124,000,000 new Ordinary Shares.\nOne warrant will be issued with every two Fundraise Shares (the \"Fundraise Warrants\"), each Fundraise Warrant entitling the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share at a price of 0.075p per share at any time within 12 months from the date of admission of the Fundraise Shares to trading on AIM (\"Admission\").\nThe Fundraise was arranged through the Company's broker, Peterhouse Capital Limited (\"Peterhouse\"). Under the terms of its engagement dated 25 October 2019, Peterhouse will be issued with 15,150,000 warrants (the \"Peterhouse Engagement Warrants\"), each warrant entitling the holder to apply for one new Ordinary Share at the Fundraise Price at any time within 12 months from the date of Admission.\nMr Patrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman of the Company, has subscribed \u00a350,000 for 100,000,000 Placing Shares as part of the Placing. Mr Cheetham's subscription constitutes a related party transaction in accordance with AIM Rule 13. The independent directors of the Company (being Mr Roger Murphy and Mr James Cole), having consulted with Beaumont Cornish Limited, the Company's nominated adviser, consider that the terms of Mr Cheetham's participation in the Placing are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nFollowing the issue of the Fundraise Shares, Mr. Cheetham will be beneficially interested in 381,832,572 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 7.94% of the Company's enlarged issued share capital.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net funds raised will be applied to general working capital and exploration of the Company's mineral projects.\nAdmission\nThe issue of the Fundraise Shares, the Fundraise Warrants and the Peterhouse Engagement Warrants is conditional only on Admission. Application has been made for the Fundraise Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM and Admission is expected to occur on or around 5\u00a0July 2024.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFor the purposes of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the Board of Sunrise hereby notifies the market that further to Admission, the Company's issued share capital will consist of 4,811,647,363 Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of 0.001p each, with voting rights (\"Ordinary Shares\"). The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in Treasury. Therefore, the total number of Ordinary Shares in the Company with voting rights will be 4,811,647,363. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as denominator for the calculations by which they may determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ('MAR').

I think Patrick realised that metals were a little \"pot luck\" and unless a bonanza find v difficult to shift. Barite was unfortunate but the right direction with industrials. CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see. Next wave \"should\" be much higher. Chin up bud!",

Get your point caddy, but i have no reason not to believe that the quality is, as stated, despite the garbage that has been trundled out over the past few years, tolsa's games, to me, have worked in our favour for once.",

          "content": "I must admit here I missed what is a lot of detailed information about the testing done on the 'Pioche' samples by our chap who hasa 20% stake in the project. It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

The number of shares alocated to them was 808.8Million and that matches what was announced today. Either way lets hope that Bergen hold onto them. For what it's worth I have taken a position in SRES recently as can see upside from current MCAP. I have always kept an eye on Sunrise and feel that if Hazen can get over the line and possibly then can do something with Pioche then 'just maybe' we can have a break from placings for a while and allow the 'biggy' CS to get done! I plan to give a bit more detail to why I invested when I get a spare bit of time. Nice to be back  ;-)",

However this is more often than not the nature of aim exploration companies. The fact remains that Sunrise has real use case industrial minerals and evidenced interest of such. To take over 10% position in a company of this nature is substantial and these funds do not invest as such without absolute due diligence? It is a risky business I cannot argue that but the industry is growing we do have interest and that is the gamble folks either to take or not. Little point in moaning about Patrick day in day out. Yes he has made some mistakes (I don't believe intentional!) but he put has also put his hand in pocket recently to the tune of 50k. You won't find many aim CEOs around doing that believe me!",

CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see.

It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

The latter is long seen as an imbalance that may be a sign that the silver price is due a major upward correction. \"The record-breaking gold price has been driven by economic uncertainties, central bank buying, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East, as well as U.S. trade policies\u200b. There is also a market move away from assets with counterparty risk to ownership of physical assets. Most commentators expect the gold price to remain strong for some time to come and the silver price to rise further. \"We hold our precious metal projects as available for sale or joint venture whilst we focus on progressing our industrial minerals projects but I think it is timely that the Company highlights to investors, shareholders and potential partners the extent of our portfolio of precious metal projects as the value inherent in these projects is often overlooked.

It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see.

          "content": "Maybe these projects could gain some attention \"We have recently seen the US dollar gold price breaking record levels and the gold to silver price ratio climbing towards record highs. The latter is long seen as an imbalance that may be a sign that the silver price is due a major upward correction. \"The record-breaking gold price has been driven by economic uncertainties, central bank buying, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East, as well as U.S. trade policies\u200b. There is also a market move away from assets with counterparty risk to ownership of physical assets. Most commentators expect the gold price to remain strong for some time to come and the silver price to rise further. \"We hold our precious metal projects as available for sale or joint venture whilst we focus on progressing our industrial minerals projects but I think it is timely that the Company highlights to investors, shareholders and potential partners the extent of our portfolio of precious metal projects as the value inherent in these projects is often overlooked. All are drill ready and most are owned 100% by the Company without underlying royalty or other interests.\" Patrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman Note: The following highlights are based entirely on previously announced information. PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS Clayton Silver-Gold Project, Nevada (Status: Drill Ready, 100% owned) \u00b7 Targeting Epithermal Ag-Au Replacement Deposit. \u00b7 Significant silver intersections in historic and Company drilling with a number of holes ending in mineralisation: \u00b7 Most recent Company results: \u00d8 Drill core from a 7.92m mineralised interval graded 303 g/t (8.84 ounces/ton) silver and 0.2 g/t gold (from 82.30m down hole \u00d8 Includes 4.27m interval grading 408 g/t (11.89 ounces/ton) silver and 0.23 g/t gold from 83.82m depth. \u00d8 84% higher silver grade in hole 20CLDD001 compared to twinned 1980s-hole CL-15 which reported 7.62m grading 165 g/t silver (4.8 ounces/ton) and 0.4 g/t gold. . \u00d8 Mineralised interval contains sulphide bearing vein quartz and quartz breccia over the down hole drilled interval of 7.92m from 82.3m depth (true thickness - as yet unknown). \u00b7 Historic grades were likely understated due to loss of fine silver-bearing sulphide minerals during the RC drilling programme.

It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

Get your point caddy, but i have no reason not to believe that the quality is, as stated, despite the garbage that has been trundled out over the past few years, tolsa's games, to me, have worked in our favour for once.",

CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see.

          "content": "Maybe these projects could gain some attention \"We have recently seen the US dollar gold price breaking record levels and the gold to silver price ratio climbing towards record highs. The latter is long seen as an imbalance that may be a sign that the silver price is due a major upward correction. \"The record-breaking gold price has been driven by economic uncertainties, central bank buying, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East, as well as U.S. trade policies\u200b. There is also a market move away from assets with counterparty risk to ownership of physical assets. Most commentators expect the gold price to remain strong for some time to come and the silver price to rise further. \"We hold our precious metal projects as available for sale or joint venture whilst we focus on progressing our industrial minerals projects but I think it is timely that the Company highlights to investors, shareholders and potential partners the extent of our portfolio of precious metal projects as the value inherent in these projects is often overlooked. All are drill ready and most are owned 100% by the Company without underlying royalty or other interests.\" Patrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman Note: The following highlights are based entirely on previously announced information. PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS Clayton Silver-Gold Project, Nevada (Status: Drill Ready, 100% owned) \u00b7 Targeting Epithermal Ag-Au Replacement Deposit. \u00b7 Significant silver intersections in historic and Company drilling with a number of holes ending in mineralisation: \u00b7 Most recent Company results: \u00d8 Drill core from a 7.92m mineralised interval graded 303 g/t (8.84 ounces/ton) silver and 0.2 g/t gold (from 82.30m down hole \u00d8 Includes 4.27m interval grading 408 g/t (11.89 ounces/ton) silver and 0.23 g/t gold from 83.82m depth. \u00d8 84% higher silver grade in hole 20CLDD001 compared to twinned 1980s-hole CL-15 which reported 7.62m grading 165 g/t silver (4.8 ounces/ton) and 0.4 g/t gold. . \u00d8 Mineralised interval contains sulphide bearing vein quartz and quartz breccia over the down hole drilled interval of 7.92m from 82.3m depth (true thickness - as yet unknown). \u00b7 Historic grades were likely understated due to loss of fine silver-bearing sulphide minerals during the RC drilling programme.

It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

Get your point caddy, but i have no reason not to believe that the quality is, as stated, despite the garbage that has been trundled out over the past few years, tolsa's games, to me, have worked in our favour for once.",

CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see.

          "content": "Maybe these projects could gain some attention \"We have recently seen the US dollar gold price breaking record levels and the gold to silver price ratio climbing towards record highs. The latter is long seen as an imbalance that may be a sign that the silver price is due a major upward correction. \"The record-breaking gold price has been driven by economic uncertainties, central bank buying, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East, as well as U.S. trade policies\u200b. There is also a market move away from assets with counterparty risk to ownership of physical assets. Most commentators expect the gold price to remain strong for some time to come and the silver price to rise further. \"We hold our precious metal projects as available for sale or joint venture whilst we focus on progressing our industrial minerals projects but I think it is timely that the Company highlights to investors, shareholders and potential partners the extent of our portfolio of precious metal projects as the value inherent in these projects is often overlooked. All are drill ready and most are owned 100% by the Company without underlying royalty or other interests.\" Patrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman Note: The following highlights are based entirely on previously announced information.

It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

Get your point caddy, but i have no reason not to believe that the quality is, as stated, despite the garbage that has been trundled out over the past few years, tolsa's games, to me, have worked in our favour for once.",

CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see.

The latter is long seen as an imbalance that may be a sign that the silver price is due a major upward correction. \"The record-breaking gold price has been driven by economic uncertainties, central bank buying, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East, as well as U.S. trade policies\u200b. There is also a market move away from assets with counterparty risk to ownership of physical assets. Most commentators expect the gold price to remain strong for some time to come and the silver price to rise further. \"We hold our precious metal projects as available for sale or joint venture whilst we focus on progressing our industrial minerals projects but I think it is timely that the Company highlights to investors, shareholders and potential partners the extent of our portfolio of precious metal projects as the value inherent in these projects is often overlooked.

It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

Get your point caddy, but i have no reason not to believe that the quality is, as stated, despite the garbage that has been trundled out over the past few years, tolsa's games, to me, have worked in our favour for once.",

CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see.

The latter is long seen as an imbalance that may be a sign that the silver price is due a major upward correction. \"The record-breaking gold price has been driven by economic uncertainties, central bank buying, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, including conflicts in the Middle East, as well as U.S. trade policies\u200b. There is also a market move away from assets with counterparty risk to ownership of physical assets. Most commentators expect the gold price to remain strong for some time to come and the silver price to rise further. \"We hold our precious metal projects as available for sale or joint venture whilst we focus on progressing our industrial minerals projects but I think it is timely that the Company highlights to investors, shareholders and potential partners the extent of our portfolio of precious metal projects as the value inherent in these projects is often overlooked.

Dicalite haven't put in any applications that I can see to develop the crow springs site - they appear to be sitting on it for now.. I expect limited Reece Ridge expenditure (maybe a small drill program) but not until monies received from Hazen... A thought on the diatomite though... I believe Dicalite may be interested in the pozzolan -also at crow springs - and, as such, may wish to save money by developing  the diatomite/ pozzolan infrastructure in tandem.. It could all suddenly kick off! On another encouraging note - I see that some of the crow springs documentation, bond determination etc has been refreshed recently....",

It was lower down the RNS. There is a lot of it and I just paste a small sample below, I would recommend anyone who did not (like me) initially read this do so as it does clarify why Pioche did not get the results that we are now getting; \"\"A second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat. In the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite. Given the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result. Taken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached. The Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date\"",

CS another go and I truly do think he made a great decision here. COVID was a killer the market was rubbish but it is picking up bud. You can see the demand now. Agreed some decisions were likely wrong for the business but I do think we are in a pretty decent position now. As ever we shall see and I do get it and it is always better to be level. I also appreciate that. Technically chart wise (if it is of any use) we would appear to be in a 1-2 pullback with the low in. This correction either a zigzag or flat we shall see.
