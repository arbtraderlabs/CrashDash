Pumice is currently mined elsewhere in the US as natural pozzolan and at Hazen it was mined as a lightweight aggregate from a shallow open pit some decades ago.\nThe markets for natural pozzolan, as a replacement for cement and fly ash in concrete, are regional and reflect the distribution of the main areas of high population density where concrete demand is highest.\nThe Hazen pozzolan deposit is just 9km from a rail siding on the arterial east-west Union Pacific line and is therefore well positioned for rail transport to the regional markets of northern California, points east, as well as the local markets around Reno and northern Nevada.\nThe Company's laboratory testwork to date has shown that the material present in the pit exceeds the specifications of ASTM standard C618 for natural pozzolan. The Hazen pumice has the additional property that it is lightweight and has potential as a lightweight aggregate for use in lightweight concrete blocks and facing stones.\nThe Optioner completed a drilling programme at Hazen in Autumn 2025.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

EPIC: \"SRES\".\nWebsite:\nwww.sunriseresourcesplc.com\nDetailed Information\nThe December 2025 field-work programme followed on from the July 2025 receipt of all remaining core samples from Tolsa's drill testing of the Pioche sepiolite deposit in 2024 and the Company's Phase 1 and 2 development testwork, details of which were reported in previous 2025 news announcements.\nThe field-work programme work was carried out by Mr Patrick Cheetham (geologist) and Mr Tom Powell, the Company's 20% partner in the project and an acknowledged expert on the processing and mining of industrial clays, especially sepiolite.\nThe first objective of the December 2025 field work was to locate and sample surface outcrops of high grade sepiolite for submission to potential partners for the project. This was carried out successfully and seven mini-bulk samples were collected across the project area.\nThe second objective was to review in detail the remaining \"core\" samples collected by Tolsa via sonic drilling and to select further samples for testing using the sample preparation techniques developed by Mr Powell which were previously reported in 2025.\nIt is clear from this review that Tolsa's sampling of core and subsequent testwork has been quite selective. Several additional and unsampled zones of sepiolite clay of varying grades were identified which have potential to add to the economic value of the deposit.\nAs a result of this core review a further 44 samples have been taken from the drill cores for further testing and for supply to interested parties.\nThe testing programme now planned for these samples is designed to demonstrate the commercial properties of the Pioche deposit over a wider range of samples than tested by the Company to-date. This includes testing to confirm its for use in oil and gas drilling in saltwater formations (see \"About Sepiolite\" below) an important market for sepiolite in the USA. This application was not tested by Tolsa but the Company's testing on a limited number of to date, as reported in 2025, gave positive results.\nA number of samples collected in December 2025 have been submitted to an interested party in Europe, a large industrial minerals company.\nFurther information will be provided as it becomes available.\nAbove:\nRecovering boulders of sepiolite clay from outcrop prior to bulk sampling.\nAbove\n:Boxed core samples from sonic drilling in storage. Samples being tested for moisture content. Sepiolite, due to its high absorbency can contain as much as 50% moisture.\nAbove.\nCore samples of sepiolite clay. Orange red spots result from chemical field tests using a chemical stain to make an initial positive identification of magnesium bearing sepiolite clay.\nAbout the Pioche Sepiolite Project\nT\nhe Pioche Sepiolite Project claims are 100% owned by SR Minerals Inc. (\"SRM\"), a Nevada-registered and wholly owned subsidiary of Sunrise Resources plc. Tom Powell holds a 20% beneficial interest in the Project.\nThe Project is located in Lincoln County, Nevada, to the northeast of Pioche, a historic mining town just off US Route 93. The Company's mining claims are on Federally owned land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Access to rail is available at the town of Caliente, 35 miles south of the project area on Route 93.\nOriginally documented as a sepiolite occurrence in the 1970s, the occurrence was relocated by the Company in 2021. In 2022, Tolsa USA, Inc., a US subsidiary of Spanish sepiolite producer Tolsa SA, entered into an option to purchase agreement with the Company and explored the property until December 2024 when the option period expired.\nTolsa completed programmes of geological mapping, trenching, auger drilling and sonic drilling. This identified two (possibly three) sub-horizontal and extensive sepiolite beds outcropping intermittently along the margins of two mesas now known as the West and East Mesa areas.\nA silica rich caprock tops the sepiolite at the discovery location forming low mesas and flattened ridgetops.\nAbout Sepiolite\nSepiolite is a non-swelling, lightweight, porous hydrous magnesium silicate clay. It has unique characteristics, is scarce, and there are very few commercial deposits in the world.\nIn the US, a major use is in oil well drilling fluids primarily as a viscosifier and suspending agent, especially in saltwater or brine-based systems where other clays like bentonite are less effective. It has a high salt tolerance and maintains viscosity in saline or seawater environments where bentonite tends to flocculate and lose effectiveness. It also exhibits thixotropic behaviour forming gels when static, suspending drill cuttings and weighting materials such as barite, but thins out under shear, aiding in pumpability. It provides good rheological properties without adding a large amount of solid material, reducing the risk of formation damage. Sepiolite has high thermal stability and so is the only clay used in high temperature and high pressure wells.\nSepiolite is used in liquid animal feed supplements as a binder and carrier for nutrients and growth promoter. It is also used in building products such as drywall tape joint compounds, putty, caulk, texture coatings and asphalt emulsion coatings where freshwater viscosity is important.\nSepiolite possesses a high surface area due to channels in the crystal lattice that gives it a structural nano-porosity. Its unusual crystal shape also adds to the internal porosity and gives it a light weight. Sepiolite's high surface area and porosity account for sepiolite's outstanding sorption capacity. Just 20g of sepiolite can have an internal surface area equivalent to that of a football field and sepiolite can absorb more than its weight in water. The largest market globally for sepiolite is for use in light-weight non-clumping pet litters where it has superior properties compared to other clays used in this application.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Pumice is currently mined elsewhere in the US as natural pozzolan and at Hazen it was mined as a lightweight aggregate from a shallow open pit some decades ago.\nThe markets for natural pozzolan, as a replacement for cement and fly ash in concrete, are regional and reflect the distribution of the main areas of high population density where concrete demand is highest.\nThe Hazen pozzolan deposit is just 9km from a rail siding on the arterial east-west Union Pacific line and is therefore well positioned for rail transport to the regional markets of northern California, points east, as well as the local markets around Reno and northern Nevada.\nThe Company's laboratory testwork to date has shown that the material present in the pit exceeds the specifications of ASTM standard C618 for natural pozzolan. The Hazen pumice has the additional property that it is lightweight and has potential as a lightweight aggregate for use in lightweight concrete blocks and facing sto\nnes.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Reach is an investor communication service aimed at assisting listed and unlisted (including AIM quoted) companies to distribute media only / non-regulatory news releases into the public domain. Information required to be notified under the AIM Rules for Companies, Market Abuse Regulation or other regulation would be disseminated as an RNS regulatory announcement and not on Reach.\nShares in the Company trade on AIM.\nEPIC: \"SRES\". Website:\nwww.sunriseresourcesplc.com\nBackground Information\nThe original discovery of copper mineralisation at surface at Garfield was made by Sunrise prior to selling the project mining claims. Sunrise has retained a 2% NSR royalty over the original claim area and a 1-mile surrounding area. NSR royalty interests such as this are risk free to the holder as they are payable from revenue and not exposed to profitability. Furthermore, they are free carried and so, as holder, we are not required to contribute to exploration or mine development costs. Royalty interests also have a ready market amongst numerous specialist royalty holding companies. The Garfield royalty is just one of a number of royalty interests held by the Company and built into our agreements with other parties.\nGMR's news release, yesterday, can be viewed in full at:\nhttps://polaris.brighterir.com/public/guardian_metal_resources/news/json_news/story/wvmdn0w\nExample of epithermal quartz vein material sampled from the Power Line zone.

Meanwhile, a royalty interest in Garfield and a gold\u2011silver push are on the docket, yet the company has not yet moved beyond the exploration phase.",
