EPIC: \"SRES\".\nWebsite:\nwww.sunriseresourcesplc.com\nDetailed Information\nThe December 2025 field-work programme followed on from the July 2025 receipt of all remaining core samples from Tolsa's drill testing of the Pioche sepiolite deposit in 2024 and the Company's Phase 1 and 2 development testwork, details of which were reported in previous 2025 news announcements.\nThe field-work programme work was carried out by Mr Patrick Cheetham (geologist) and Mr Tom Powell, the Company's 20% partner in the project and an acknowledged expert on the processing and mining of industrial clays, especially sepiolite.\nThe first objective of the December 2025 field work was to locate and sample surface outcrops of high grade sepiolite for submission to potential partners for the project. This was carried out successfully and seven mini-bulk samples were collected across the project area.\nThe second objective was to review in detail the remaining \"core\" samples collected by Tolsa via sonic drilling and to select further samples for testing using the sample preparation techniques developed by Mr Powell which were previously reported in 2025.\nIt is clear from this review that Tolsa's sampling of core and subsequent testwork has been quite selective. Several additional and unsampled zones of sepiolite clay of varying grades were identified which have potential to add to the economic value of the deposit.\nAs a result of this core review a further 44 samples have been taken from the drill cores for further testing and for supply to interested parties.\nThe testing programme now planned for these samples is designed to demonstrate the commercial properties of the Pioche deposit over a wider range of samples than tested by the Company to-date. This includes testing to confirm its for use in oil and gas drilling in saltwater formations (see \"About Sepiolite\" below) an important market for sepiolite in the USA. This application was not tested by Tolsa but the Company's testing on a limited number of to date, as reported in 2025, gave positive results.\nA number of samples collected in December 2025 have been submitted to an interested party in Europe, a large industrial minerals company.\nFurther information will be provided as it becomes available.\nAbove:\nRecovering boulders of sepiolite clay from outcrop prior to bulk sampling.\nAbove\n:Boxed core samples from sonic drilling in storage. Samples being tested for moisture content. Sepiolite, due to its high absorbency can contain as much as 50% moisture.\nAbove.\nCore samples of sepiolite clay. Orange red spots result from chemical field tests using a chemical stain to make an initial positive identification of magnesium bearing sepiolite clay.\nAbout the Pioche Sepiolite Project\nT\nhe Pioche Sepiolite Project claims are 100% owned by SR Minerals Inc. (\"SRM\"), a Nevada-registered and wholly owned subsidiary of Sunrise Resources plc. Tom Powell holds a 20% beneficial interest in the Project.\nThe Project is located in Lincoln County, Nevada, to the northeast of Pioche, a historic mining town just off US Route 93. The Company's mining claims are on Federally owned land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Access to rail is available at the town of Caliente, 35 miles south of the project area on Route 93.\nOriginally documented as a sepiolite occurrence in the 1970s, the occurrence was relocated by the Company in 2021. In 2022, Tolsa USA, Inc., a US subsidiary of Spanish sepiolite producer Tolsa SA, entered into an option to purchase agreement with the Company and explored the property until December 2024 when the option period expired.\nTolsa completed programmes of geological mapping, trenching, auger drilling and sonic drilling. This identified two (possibly three) sub-horizontal and extensive sepiolite beds outcropping intermittently along the margins of two mesas now known as the West and East Mesa areas.\nA silica rich caprock tops the sepiolite at the discovery location forming low mesas and flattened ridgetops.\nAbout Sepiolite\nSepiolite is a non-swelling, lightweight, porous hydrous magnesium silicate clay. It has unique characteristics, is scarce, and there are very few commercial deposits in the world.\nIn the US, a major use is in oil well drilling fluids primarily as a viscosifier and suspending agent, especially in saltwater or brine-based systems where other clays like bentonite are less effective. It has a high salt tolerance and maintains viscosity in saline or seawater environments where bentonite tends to flocculate and lose effectiveness. It also exhibits thixotropic behaviour forming gels when static, suspending drill cuttings and weighting materials such as barite, but thins out under shear, aiding in pumpability. It provides good rheological properties without adding a large amount of solid material, reducing the risk of formation damage. Sepiolite has high thermal stability and so is the only clay used in high temperature and high pressure wells.\nSepiolite is used in liquid animal feed supplements as a binder and carrier for nutrients and growth promoter. It is also used in building products such as drywall tape joint compounds, putty, caulk, texture coatings and asphalt emulsion coatings where freshwater viscosity is important.\nSepiolite possesses a high surface area due to channels in the crystal lattice that gives it a structural nano-porosity. Its unusual crystal shape also adds to the internal porosity and gives it a light weight. Sepiolite's high surface area and porosity account for sepiolite's outstanding sorption capacity. Just 20g of sepiolite can have an internal surface area equivalent to that of a football field and sepiolite can absorb more than its weight in water. The largest market globally for sepiolite is for use in light-weight non-clumping pet litters where it has superior properties compared to other clays used in this application.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Sunrise has retained a 2% NSR royalty over the original claim area and a 1-mile surrounding area. NSR royalty interests such as this are risk free to the holder as they are payable from revenue and not exposed to profitability. Furthermore, they are free carried and so, as holder, we are not required to contribute to exploration or mine development costs. Royalty interests also have a ready market amongst numerous specialist royalty holding companies. The Garfield royalty is just one of a number of royalty interests held by the Company and built into our agreements with other parties.\nGMR's news release, yesterday, can be viewed in full at:\nhttps://polaris.brighterir.com/public/guardian_metal_resources/news/json_news/story/wvmdn0w\nExample of epithermal quartz vein material sampled from the Power Line zone.

We are very pleased to report continuing positive results and a breakthrough in processing Pioche sepiolite clay that has delivered results comparable to those obtained with high-grade Spanish sepiolite.\n\"Given that we have not yet been able to test higher-grade Pioche sepiolite samples, this is a great result. We are now gearing up bench-scale production of processed sepiolite to service demand from potential customers where, to date, we have only been able to provide raw clay samples to date.\"\nSepiolite is a naturally occurring, fibrous clay mineral (a hydrous magnesium silicate) that is rarely found in commercial quantities. On the Company's Pioche Project, sepiolite clays have been shown by drilling and surface sampling to occur at surface and at shallow depth over at least a 2.6 x 1.3km area with cumulative thicknesses up to several metres.\nSepiolite typically sells in the range US$150-800/ton with specialty surface treated grades commanding a value over US$1,800/ton.\nFurther information:\nSunrise Resources plc\nPatrick Cheetham, Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)1625 838 884\nBeaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser\nJames Biddle/Roland Cornish\nTel: +44 (0)207 628 3396\nAlbR Capital Limited\nBroker\nLucy Williams/Duncan Vasey\nTel: +44 (0)207 469 0930\nShares in the Company trade on AIM.

Upon the publication of this announcement via Regulatory Information Service ('RIS'), this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nDetailed Information\nSepiolite is a naturally occurring, fibrous clay mineral (a hydrous magnesium silicate) that is rarely found in commercial quantities.\nWhilst sepiolite has many commercial applications these applications fall into two main categories - lower value applications that rely on the sorptive properties of sepiolite (e./g pet litters, animal feeds) and higher value applications that rely on sepiolite's 'gelling' properties, i.e. its ability to increase the viscosity of fluids in both fresh and salt water (e.g. in oil and gas well drilling fluids, paints and coatings, and building products). Attapulgite clay also serves this market but is mined in northern Florida, whereas the main oilfield markets are in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.\nVisible at a microscopic scale, sepiolite clay is comprised of elongated fibres or ribbons which when dispersed in fluids increase viscosity. Viscosity is measured in Centipoise (cP),\na unit of measurement for dynamic viscosity, which describes a fluid's resistance to flow. Liquids with higher centipoise values are thicker and flow more slowly, while those with lower values are thinner and flow more easily. For reference, water at 20 degrees centigrade has a viscosity of approximately 1cP, molasses 5-10,000cP.\nIn commercial deposits, the mineral sepiolite occurs in association with other clay minerals such as saponite, and gangue minerals, such as quartz and dolomite but in commercial practice it is expensive to separate the sepiolite so the clay is characterised as either waste, medium, or high grade depending on the relative proportion of sepiolite, the quality of the contained sepiolite and the use to which the sepiolite is intended. Generally, Spanish sepiolite is higher grade and higher quality compared to that currently mined and used in the USA. The performance of a sepiolite clay can be improved by applying appropriate mineral processing (non-separation) techniques that modify the physical properties of the sepiolite.\nThe Company's evaluation to-date has focused on the gelling properties of Pioche sepiolite and comparison of Pioche samples with commercial reference samples from the USA and Spain. It has sought to build on testing carried out by Tolsa on various surface and drill samples as well as the preliminary testwork reported by the Company in April this year.\nTolsa undertook viscosity testing on 293 separate sample of Pioche clay collected from surface and from drill holes across a wide area of the Pioche Property using their inhouse testing protocol for freshwater applications. No testwork was done for saltwater applications as, although a large market in the USA, this is not a market in their geographical segment.\nTolsa's testwork on Pioche clays yielded samples with freshwater viscosities up to 24,680cP. However, for whatever reason, Tolsa only returned samples to the Company that had tested up to 11,400cP, the higher grade samples presumably having been consumed in testwork.\nThe Company's first phase of testwork established that the Pioche sepiolite \"ribbons\" were matted and bundled together and this contributed to lower viscosities but when processed by mechanical shearing the viscosities increased several- fold due to delamination of the sepiolite ribbons.\nThe second phase of testwork had two objectives.\nThe main objective was to build on the results of SRM's Phase 1 testing to devise a standardised sample preparation methodology that gave freshwater viscosity results in line with Tolsa's own viscosity testing which, when applied to commercial reference samples, would provide a benchmark against which Tolsa's results could be evaluated to identify those areas where more detailed drilling might be expected to define mineable reserves.\nTwelve samples were selected having viscosities between 0 and 11,400cP in Tolsa's testing (higher grade Pioche samples not being available). After some experimentation the Company was able to develop a standardised bench scale process that yielded results comparable to those obtained by Tolsa and comparable to Amargosa sepiolite ore produced on a commercial basis in Nevada. One outlier sample tested yielded a viscosity of 24,600cP a result comparable to that obtained in testing gold-standard Spanish sepiolite.\nA second objective was to test the same range of samples for their gelling effect in saltwater, an important application for drilling through saltwater formations in oil and gas wells. Tolsa did not evaluate this application. The Company's testing was carried out in accordance with American Petroleum Institute procedures and yielded results comparable to those obtained from Amargosa sepiolite. This underlines the potential for Pioche sepiolite to replace Amargosa sepiolite where future mining is under regulatory threat.\nIn the final stages of the Phase 2 testwork, the processing method was developed further and achieved a significant breakthrough, increasing the saltwater viscosity in the two samples tested by a factor of 4x, giving results only seen so far in the Company's testing of Spanish sepiolite.\nGiven the limitations on samples currently available to the Company, where some of the highest quality samples based on Tolsa's own testing could not be tested, this is a very significant result.\nTaken together all of the work carried out by the Company continues to highlight the East Mesa area of the Pioche Property as the prime target for resource definition and first commercial production. Geological cross sections are attached.\nThe Company is now in the process of producing on the bench-scale kg quantities of processed sepiolite for customer testing having only supplied raw clay products to date.\nNOTES:\nThe testwork programme now being reported was designed and executed by Mr. Tom Powell. Mr. Powell is a degreed chemist and was formerly the General Manager of the IMV sepiolite mine in the Amargosa Valley, Nevada, USA. Mr. Powell is an acknowledged expert on specialty clays and sepiolite in particular, and holds a number of patents on clay products. Mr. Powell holds a 20% economic interest in the Pioche Sepiolite Project.\nAbout the Pioche Sepiolite Project\nT\nhe Pioche Sepiolite Project claims are 100% owned by SR Minerals Inc. (\"SRM\"), a Nevada-registered and wholly owned subsidiary of Sunrise Resources plc. Tom Powell holds a 20% beneficial interest in the Project.\nThe Project is located in Lincoln County, Nevada, to the northeast of Pioche, a historic mining town just off US Route 93. The Company's mining claims are on Federally owned land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Access to rail is available at the town of Caliente, 35 miles south of the project area on Route 93.\nOriginally documented as a sepiolite occurrence in the 1970s, the occurrence was relocated by the Company in 2021. In 2022, Tolsa USA, Inc., a US subsidiary of Spanish sepiolite producer Tolsa SA, entered into an option to purchase agreement with the Company and explored the property until December 2024 when the option period expired.\nTolsa completed programmes of geological mapping, trenching, auger drilling and sonic drilling. This identified two (possibly three) sub-horizontal and extensive sepiolite beds outcropping intermittently along the margins of two mesas now known as the West and East Mesa areas.\nA silica rich caprock tops the sepiolite at the discovery location forming low mesas and flattened ridgetops.\nAbout Sepiolite\nSepiolite is a rare form of clay with very few commercial deposits in the world. It is non-swelling, lightweight and highly porous. It is used extensively in pet litter, agriculture as a slow-release absorbent and adsorbent carrier for chemicals and pesticides and in animal feeds as a binder and carrier for nutrients and growth promoter. It is also a valuable gelling agent and viscosity modifier in a number of industrial products.\nAt present, there is only one active sepiolite mining operation in the USA, in the Amargosa Valley, Nevada, but the future of that operation is limited by the encroachment of areas of critical environmental concern.\nQualified Person Information:\nThe information in this release has been compiled and reviewed by Mr. Patrick Cheetham (MIMMM, MAusIMM) who is a qualified person for the purposes of the AIM Note for Mining and Oil & Gas Companies. Mr. Cheetham is a Member of the Institute of Materials, Minerals & Mining and also a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy.\nCautionary Notice\nThe news release may contain certain statements and expressions of belief, expectation or opinion which are forward looking statements, and which relate, inter alia, to the Company's proposed strategy, plans and objectives or to the expectations or intentions of the Company's directors.
