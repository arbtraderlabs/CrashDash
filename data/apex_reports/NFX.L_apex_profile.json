The Open Offer is being made on a pre-emptive basis, allowing all Qualifying Shareholders the opportunity to participate by subscribing for Open Offer Shares at the Issue Price of 0.2 pence per Ordinary Share,\npro rata\nto their holdings of Existing Ordinary Shares. The purpose of this Document is to set out the background to, and reasons for, the Open Offer and to provide Qualifying Shareholders with details of its terms and conditions.\nIn addition, the Underwriter, CMC UK Markets plc, have agreed to\nsubscribe, at the Issue Price, for any Open Offer Shares not otherwise taken up by Qualifying Shareholders pursuant to the Open Offer as explained further in paragraph 5 below.\n2.\nBackground to and reasons for the Open Offer\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development group targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via a drug repurposing strategy. The Group aims to use its expertise in discovering, patenting and subsequently developing novel drug forms with improved physical properties, to develop new product opportunities that are differentiated from the original product (by way of dose, delivery route or presentation), thus creating new and attractive commercial opportunities. Nuformix has an early-stage pipeline of preclinical assets which the Directors believe has the potential for significant value and early licensing opportunities.\nNuformix's small early-stage pipeline of preclinical assets aims to address areas of high unmet medical need in fibrosis and oncology. The Group has historically targeted product solutions using its expertise in discovering and filing patent applications on novel crystalline forms of existing, marketed drugs. The Group's proprietary drug forms have improved physical properties that potentially offer solutions to historic limitations that have hindered previous development efforts, with the aim of developing novel products, each representing a commercial opportunity. Importantly, the envisaged commercial opportunity is optimised when the repurposed product becomes differentiated from the original marketed drug by way of either dose, route of administration or presentation.\nDrug repurposing is a well-known and successful strategy for enhancing the therapeutic and commercial value of marketed drugs. Such development approaches typically offer a greater probability of success compared to developing newly discovered drugs, due to the existing safety and efficacy data that has been generated on the marketed drug. The existence of this data may also result in lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines.\nThe Group's business model is to develop its lead programmes through key technical value inflection points before partnering or licensing the associated IP. The Group conducts research and development (\"\nR&D\n\") activities through out-sourcing, to enable it to access the different types of expertise that are needed for drug R&D and to minimise operational costs. The Group has established a network of external contractors, with whom the Group have developed relationships over many years. These external contractor relationships span the development supply chain from pre-clinical to clinical development and include well-known pharmaceutical industry contract research and development organisations through to specialist organisations and universities where more bespoke services are required, both using standard terms and conditions or a negotiated contract agreement. The Group has historically held collaborative research and development agreements with numerous companies including Vectura Plc, Vistagen Inc., Benevolent AI and most recently Oxilio Ltd.\nNXP002 is the Group's preclinical lead asset and the current primary focus of the Group. NXP002 is a potential novel inhaled treatment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"\nIPF\n\"), Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"\nPPF\n\") and possibly other fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases (\"\nILDs\n\"). NXP002 is a proprietary, new form of the drug tranilast. NXP002's enhanced physical properties allow delivery to the lung via nebulization\n.\nThere are more than 200 types of interstitial lung diseases (ILD), which are characterised by varied amounts of inflammation, scarring, or both, that damage the lung's ability to absorb oxygen. IPF is the most well-known form of ILD, affecting approximately 100,000 patients per year in the U.S. Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (PPF), previously referred to as Progressive Fibrosing ILD (PF-ILD), is a larger and even more poorly served segment of the ILD market, affecting approximately 200,000 patients per year in the U.S.\nIPF and PPF are devastating lung diseases associated with a higher mortality rate than many cancers with median survival of 3-5 years. Thus, IPF and PPF represent a high unmet medical need such that the requirement for improved treatment options represents what the Directors believe to be a significant commercial opportunity. IPF is classified as a rare disease and presents a global commercial market that is forecast to grow to US$6.4bn by 2031.\nSales of standard-of-care (\"SoC\") therapy OFEV achieved EUR3.8bn in 2024. Sales of Esbriet, also an IPF SoC therapy peaked\u00a0in 2020 at USD1.2bn prior to genericisation.\nTranilast has a long history of safe use as an oral drug for asthma, keloids and hypertrophic scarring, but while there is growing evidence that supports its potential use in other fibrotic conditions, including IPF, a combination of poor physicochemical properties, variable pharmacokinetics and challenging pharmacodynamics following oral delivery limit its potential use in ILDs. NXP002 is differentiated as it is a patent protected, novel form of tranilast that has been optimised for formulation and delivery direct to the lungs by inhalation, potentially overcoming the issues using tranilast orally as a chronic treatments for ILDs.\nThe inhalation route is a well-known strategy for the treatment of lung diseases to yield greater efficacy and reduce systemic, off-target side-effects compared to oral treatment. Discontinuation of treatment in IPF and PPF patients is currently an issue in the treatment of these diseases with discontinuation rates for current SoCs up to 64% in certain patient groups due to, in part, their debilitating systemic side-\neffects. The Directors believe effective inhalation therapies offer the potential to overcome these limitations of oral therapies.\nThe positioning of NXP002 as an inhaled treatment for IPF and PPF could be either as added to SoC treatments or administered as a monotherapy for patients non-responsive to SoCs and those declining these therapies due to side effects which impact quality of life.\nThe Group's pre-clinical inhalation development strategy has significantly progressed NXP002 towards validation of its Target Product Profile (\"\nTPP\n\") demonstrating:\n\u2022\nNXP002 can be delivered in-vivo by a range of nebulisers at the optimum particle size for delivery to the deep lung;\n\u2022\nhigh doses appear to be well-tolerated; and\n\u2022\nan in-vivo inhalation dose response was observed for inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers that is consistent with ex-vivo human IPF tissue studies to date.\nThe Group conducted studies in a new iteration of a 3D human IPF lung tissue using a disease and species relevant model that has been advanced to significantly reduce output variability. The results from these studies of NXP002 alone and in combination with current SoCs, can be summarised as follows:\n\u2022\nNXP002 is well tolerated in ex-vivo human lung tissue with no signs of toxicity events;\n\u2022\nNXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by modulation of the release of multiple biomarkers of fibrosis and inflammation;\n\u2022\nboth high and low concentrations of NXP002 show an additive anti-fibrotic and anti- inflammatory effect to SoC;\n\u2022\nin particular, the higher concentrations of NXP002 with SoC's deliver a near complete ablation of fibrosis biomarker release, yet at lower concentrations than have been seen in other preclinical models to date; and\n\u2022\nthe clear, pronounced additive benefit of NXP002 on top of SoCs observed suggests that NXP002 may provide additional efficacy, even in patients responding to SoC therapy.\nThis raises the possibility that NXP002 targets additional disease pathways to SoC's when increasing the combined anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory response. Following success in suppressing biomarkers of fibrotic disease progression in human IPF lung tissue, the same samples were analysed to assess additional mechanistic and anti-inflammatory benefits on top of SoC's and the results are summarised as follows:\n\u2022\nNXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines by over 90% for all cytokines studied; and\n\u2022\nthe results further suggest that NXP002 may provide additional efficacy in combination with SoC's, even in patients not responding to SoC therapy alone.\nNuformix's TPP for NXP002 seeks twice daily inhalation administration. To assess NXP002's duration of action, the Group initiated work in an exploratory model in healthy human lung tissue. The model also bridges the Group's successful preclinical work across a variety of LPS-challenge studies. The results are summarised as follows:\n\u2022\nNXP002 suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines by healthy human lung tissue following LPS challenge; and\n\u2022\nan anti-inflammatory effect remains at 12 hours post drug dosing demonstrated by continued suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines following LPS challenge, confirming NXP002 has a duration of action that may support twice daily dosing.\nData from the precision-cut lung slice (\"\nPCLS\n\") disease model referred to above were reanalysed as part of the on-going discussions with potential licensing and development partners for NXP002. NXP002 had been studied in tissue from an autoimmune ILD explanted lung (in this case from a patient diagnosed with non-specific interstitial pneumonia or NSIP). This data was revisited to compare key biomarker changes in tissue in response to NXP002 treatment using an 'area under the curve' (AUC)\nbased approach, considering total biomarker expression during the treatment period. These new results are summarised as follows:\n\u2022\na clear dose response to NXP002 was observed across both extra cellular matrix (\"ECM\") biomarkers and pro-fibrotic mediators suggesting NXP002's activity in additional pathways to standards of care;\n\u2022\na consistent and significant effect of NXP002 was observed alone and in combination with standards of care across both biomarker types in all donors;\n\u2022\nwhen the Col1A1 gene was found to be overexpressed in tissue, representing active fibrotic disease and tissue turner, NXP002 consistently attenuates its expression. When Col1A1 is not overexpressed Col1A1 is maintained, which may point towards NXP002's role in ECM homeostasis and supporting healthy tissue repair and regeneration, consistent with the evidence base describing positive results from clinical studies of tranilast in a range of fibrotic diseases; and\n\u2022\nthe autoimmune-ILD donor studied also showed a significant response across both biomarker types alongside the seven IPF donors confirming that NXP002's activity translates well to autoimmune-derived ILDs.\nRecently the Group has developed new insights relating to its NXP002 lead programme. Following an in-depth pharmacology review, leveraging human and AI-methodologies, the pathways associated with disease progression in fibrotic diseases in which NXP002 has demonstrated both activity and clinical translation have been assessed across multiple organs. The resulting outputs allow clear demonstration of NXP002's potential to regulate four specific pathways that drive fibrotic disease. This includes core pathways, such as the TGF- \u00df pathway, but also evidences regulation of the WNT/\u00df-catenin and NLRP3 pathways, which are emerging as key disease progression pathways requiring suppression. The outputs also illustrate consistent translation from cell-based studies to clinical studies across multiple fibrotic organs, including the lung, in the resolution of extra cellular matrix deposition.\nIn addition, the Group\ndiscovered novel forms of olaparib, a drug currently marketed by AstraZeneca, as Lynparza\u00ae, the Group's NXP004 programme. Lynparza\u00ae was approved for the treatment of adults with advanced ovarian cancer and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation and has since secured similar approvals in breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. These approvals have propelled Lynparza\u00ae sales to US$2.6bn in 2022 with industry analysts forecasting annual sales of US$4bn by 2027. Subsequently, further preformulation and in-vitro studies allowed Nuformix to identify lead cocrystals to be progressed for further development. Results from in vitro dissolution studies demonstrated that the two lead NXP004 cocrystals out-performed Lynparza\u00ae, both in terms of rate and extent of dissolution and release of olaparib. Enhancement of dissolution in the currently marketed formulation of Lynparza\u00ae resulted in improved bioavailability versus the initial marketed product. Therefore, the Directors believe that NXP004 may offer potential to further increase olaparib's bioavailability. In addition, the Directors believe that the potential simplicity of NXP004-based formulations may offer improvements in product cost-of-goods versus the currently marketed product, which requires complex manufacturing methods. Whilst progressing NXP004 is not an immediate priority for the Group, the Directors believe that these attributes position NXP004 for applications in line-extensions for the currently marketed product.\nNXP001 is a proprietary new form of the drug aprepitant that is currently marketed as a product in the oncology supportive care setting (chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting) initially exclusively licensed to Oxilio Limited (\"\nOxilio\n\") for oncology indications. Oxilio has acquired ownership of Nuformix's NXP001 patent portfolio. Nuformix retained rights to receive further development milestones and royalties capped at \u00a32 million per year under the terms of acquisition.\nHowever, the Group's current primary focus is focused on generating data and further developing discussions with potential partners that may support its efforts to secure an out-licence, option or collaborative agreement for NXP002.\nThe Directors concluded that NXP002 as a potential treatment for IPF, was a likely candidate for Orphan Drug Designation\n(\"\nODD\n\")\n, which could provide additional product protection against potential future competitors in addition to product development advantages. On 29 May 2025, The Group announced\nthat the European Medicines Agency (\"\nEMA\n\") had granted ODD in IPF for tranilast to the Group. ODD in the European Union (\"\nEU\n\") is granted by the European Commission based on a positive opinion adopted by the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products that can demonstrate potential for significant advancement in treatment of rare and debilitating diseases affecting no more than five in 10,000 individuals in the EU. ODD provides incentives to developers of medicines for limited patient populations, including 10 years market exclusivity, protocol assistance (guidance on study design and scientific evaluation) and regulatory fee reductions.\nOn 11 August 2025 the Group announced that it had\nsubmitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration (\"\nFDA\n\") for ODD in the United States using FDA Form 4035\n. The FDA are currently reviewing the application and it is expected that\nwithin 90 days of receipt, they will issue a designation letter, a request for more information or a denial. If ODD is granted in the US, Nuformix may be eligible for certain benefits such as tax credits for clinical trials or qualified clinical testing costs, a waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee when a marketing application is submitted, and the potential to receive seven years of marketing exclusivity upon product approval.\nDiscussions with potential partners have progressed, such that the Group believes that alongside the FDA ODD application, the following activities will aid the ongoing out-licensing discussions and will be the focus of the use of proceeds from the Open Offer:\n\u2022\nAssessment of the likely inhaled human therapeutic window;\n\u2022\nContinued use of expert industry consultants to support partnering discussions and subsequent diligence processes;\n\u2022\nContinued investment into the maintenance and prosecution of key IP;\n\u2022\nContinued progression of partnering discussions with multiple parties with the aim of securing an out-licence, option or collaborative development agreement;\n\u2022\nProvide working capital for the Group whilst it progresses the above activities.\nIt is anticipated that the outlined assessments can be completed via expert analysis of existing data. However, additional supporting data may need to be generated. Whilst the Group intends to use the net proceeds from the Open Offer to perform the outlined assessments, generate any additional supporting data, continue, and further develop, discussions with potential partners with the aim of securing an out-licence, option or collaborative agreement on the Company's NXP002 programme, it is possible that prospective licensees may require additional data over and above the studies already undertaken before an out-licensing transaction may be concluded. If no out-licence, option or collaborative agreement is concluded by the end of March 2026, or the revenue generated by such deal does not provide sufficient working capital to meet the Company's strategy further funding would be required to provide working capital in line with the Company's strategy to fund corporate and operational overheads and to fund further studies before an out-licensing transaction may be concluded.\nWhilst the Open Offer is underwritten, and the gross proceeds expected to be received by the Company are fixed, the Board would like to ensure that Qualifying Shareholders have the ability to maximise their opportunity to subscribe for Open Offer Shares. The Company has therefore included the Excess Application Facility to enable those Qualifying Shareholders who wish to apply for more Open Offer Shares than their Basic Entitlements to do so.\n3. The Open Offer\nThe Company is proposing to raise approximately \u00a3228,081 pursuant to the Open Offer. The Issue Price of 0.2 pence per Open Offer Share represents a discount of 33.33 per cent. to the closing mid-price of 0.3 pence per Existing Ordinary Share on 27 October 2025, the latest practicable date prior to announcing the Open Offer. The Open Offer is being made on a pre-emptive basis, allowing all Qualifying Shareholders the opportunity to participate.\nThe Open Offer provides Qualifying Shareholders with the opportunity to apply to acquire Open Offer Shares at the Issue Price\npro rata\nto their holdings of Existing Ordinary Shares as at the Record Date on the following basis:\n2 Open Offer Shares for every 35\nExisting Ordinary Shares held\nEntitlements to apply to acquire Open Offer Shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and any fractional entitlement to Open Offer Shares will be aggregated under the Excess Application Facility.\nValid applications by Qualifying Shareholders will be satisfied in full up to their Basic Entitlements as shown on the Application Form. Applicants can apply for less or more than their entitlements under the Open Offer but the Company cannot guarantee that any application for Excess Shares under the Excess Application Facility will be satisfied as this will depend in part on the extent to which other Qualifying Shareholders apply for less than or more than their own Basic Entitlements. The Company may satisfy valid applications for Excess Shares of applicants in whole or in part but reserves the right not to satisfy any excess above any Basic Entitlement. Applications made under the Excess Application Facility will be scaled back\npro rata\nto the number of Excess Shares applied for by Qualifying Shareholders under the Excess Application Facility if applications are received from Qualifying Shareholders for more than the available number of Excess Shares.\nQualifying Shareholders who do not take up their Basic Entitlements in full will experience a dilution to their interests of approximately 5.41 per cent. following Admission.\nQualifying Shareholders should note that the Open Offer is being underwritten on the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.\nQualifying Shareholders with fewer than 18 Existing Ordinary Shares will not be able to apply for Open Offer Shares.\nThe Open Offer Shares will, when issued and fully paid, rank\npari passu\nin all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of Admission.\nConditions\nThe Open Offer is conditional,\ninter alia\n, upon the Admission of the Open Offer Shares becoming effective by not later than 8:00 a.m. on 13 November 2025 (or such later time and/or date as the Company may determine, being not later than the Long Stop Date).\nIf conditions are not satisfied and Admission does not occur by 8:00 a.m. on 13 November 2025 (or by 8:00 a.m. on the Long Stop Date), the Open Offer will not proceed and any applications made by Qualifying Shareholders will be rejected. In such circumstances, application monies will be returned (at the applicant's sole risk), without payment of interest, as soon as practicable thereafter. Revocation of applications for Open Offer Shares cannot occur after dealings have begun.\nExcess applications\nThe Open Offer is structured to allow Qualifying Shareholders to subscribe for Open Offer Shares at the Issue Price\npro rata\nto their existing holdings of Existing Ordinary Shares on the Record Date.\nQualifying Shareholders may also make applications in excess of their Basic Entitlements. To the extent that Basic Entitlements are not subscribed by Qualifying Shareholders, such Open Offer Shares will be available to satisfy such excess applications, subject always to a maximum of 114,040,535 Open Offer Shares in aggregate and provided that no Qualifying Shareholder shall be entitled to subscribe for Open Offer Shares if it would bring their aggregate interest in the share capital of the Company to more than the Aggregate Limit. To the extent that applications are received in respect of an aggregate of more than 114,040,535 Open Offer Shares and/or would result in a Qualifying Shareholder having an aggregate interest in the share capital of the Company which would exceed the Aggregate Limit, excess applications will be scaled back\npro rata\nto the number of Excess Shares applied for by Qualifying Shareholders under the Excess Application Facility.\nThe Open Offer will be made to Shareholders outside of the United Kingdom and EEA by means of a notice in the London Gazette, details of which are provided in paragraph 7 of Part III of this Document.\nQualifying Shareholders should note that the Open Offer is not a rights issue.\nQualifying non-CREST Shareholders should be aware that the Application Form is not a negotiable document and cannot be traded. Qualifying Shareholders should also be aware that, in the Open Offer, unlike in a rights issue, any entitlements to Open Offer Shares not applied for or not taken up will not be sold in the market or placed for the benefit of Qualifying Shareholders who do not apply under the Open Offer.\nSettlement and dealings\nApplication will be made to the FCA for the Open Offer Shares to be admitted to the equity shares (transition) category of the Official List in accordance with Chapter 22 of the UKLR and to the London Stock Exchange plc for such Open Offer Shares to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities\n. It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the Open Offer Shares will commence at 8:00 a.m. on 13 November 2025. Further information in respect of settlement and dealings in the Open Offer Shares is set out in paragraph 9 of Part III of this Document.\nOverseas Shareholders\nCertain Overseas Shareholders may not be permitted to subscribe for Open Offer Shares pursuant to the Open Offer and should refer to paragraphs 6 and 7 of Part III of this Document. Persons who have a registered address in or who are located and/or resident in or are citizens of, in each case, a country other than the United Kingdom should consult their professional advisers as to whether they require any governmental or other consents or need to observe any other formalities to enable them to acquire or subscribe for any Open Offer Shares. The notice in the London Gazette referred to in paragraph 7 of Part III of this Document will state where an Application Form may be inspected or obtained. Any person with a registered address in or who are located in and/or resident in or are citizens of, in each case, a Restricted Jurisdiction who obtains a copy of this Document or an Application Form is required to disregard them, except with the consent of the Company.\nCREST instructions\nApplication has been made for the Basic Entitlements and the Excess Entitlements for Qualifying CREST Shareholders to be admitted to CREST. It is expected that the Basic Entitlements and the Excess Entitlements will be enabled for settlement through the CREST system as soon as practicable on 29 October 2025. Applications through the CREST system may only be made by the Qualifying Shareholder originally entitled or by a person entitled by virtue of a\nbona fide\nmarket claim.\n4.\nACTION TO BE TAKEN IN RESPECT OF THE OPEN OFFER\nThe latest time for applications under the Open Offer to be received is 11:00 a.m. on 11 November 2025. The procedure for application and payment depends on whether, at the time at which application and payment is made, a Qualifying Shareholder has an Application Form in respect of their Basic Entitlement or have their Basic Entitlement credited to their stock account in CREST.\nQualifying non-CREST Shareholders\nQualifying non-CREST Shareholders will receive a personalised Application Form which gives details of their Basic Entitlement under the Open Offer (as shown by the number of the Open Offer Shares allocated to them) with this Document. If they wish to apply for Open Offer Shares under the Open Offer, they should complete the accompanying Application Form in accordance with the procedure for application set out in this Document and on the Application Form itself. The completed Application Form, accompanied by full payment, should be returned by post or by hand (during normal business hours only) to MUFG Corporate Markets so as to arrive as soon as possible and in any event no later than 11:00 a.m. on 11 November 2025.\nQualifying CREST Shareholders\nQualifying CREST Shareholders, will receive no Application Form with this Document but will receive a credit to their appropriate stock account in CREST in respect of their Basic Entitlement and if appropriate their Excess Entitlement. They should refer to the procedure for application set out in Part III of this Document. The relevant CREST instruction must have settled by no later than 11:00 a.m. on 11 November 2025.\nIf you are in any doubt as to what action you should take, you should immediately seek your own personal financial advice from your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other independent professional adviser duly authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) if you are resident in the United Kingdom or, if not, from another appropriately authorised independent financial adviser.\n5.
