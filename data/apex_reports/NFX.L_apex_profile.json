The Group operates a lean structure with the limited Board and brings in specialist consultants, experts in their field, to support the business as required.\nPipeline\nNuformix has a small pipeline of preclinical assets in development to address the high unmet medical need in fibrosis and oncology. We target solutions using our expertise to develop and file patent applications on novel crystalline forms of existing, marketed drugs, that have improved physical properties, with the aim of developing novel products in new indications to create attractive commercial opportunities. Importantly, the commercial opportunity is optimised when the repurposed product is differentiated from the original marketed product by way of either dose, route of administration or presentation.\nDrug repurposing is a well-known and successful strategy for enhancing the therapeutic and commercial value of marketed drugs. Such development strategies typically offer a greater probability of success compared to developing newly discovered drugs. This is due to the existing data that has been generated on the marketed drug, which can serve as an evidence-base for safety and efficacy in envisaged novel products. This existence of data may also result in lower overall development costs, shorter development timelines and reduced risk in development.\nThe Group's business model is to take its assets through key value inflection points before partnering or licensing its IP. We conduct research and development (\"R&D\") activities through out-sourcing, to enable access to different types of expertise that are needed for effective R&D and to minimise our operational costs. The Group has a strong network of external contractors, with whom we have had relationships over many years.\nNXP002 (novel proprietary form of tranilast) - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"IPF\")\nNXP002 is the Group's lead asset and a potential novel inhaled treatment for IPF, Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"PPF\"), and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (\"ILD\"). NXP002 is a proprietary, new form of the drug tranilast with enhanced physical properties that allow delivery direct to the lung via nebulisation.\nThere are more than 200 types of ILD, which are characterised by varied amounts of inflammation, scarring, or both, that damage the lung's ability to absorb oxygen. IPF is the most well-known form of ILD, affecting approximately 100,000 patients per year in the US. PPF previously referred to as Progressive Fibrosing ILD (PF-ILD), is a larger and even more poorly served segment of the ILD market, affecting approximately 200,000 patients per year in the US.\nIPF and PPF are devastating lung diseases associated with a higher mortality rate than many cancers with median survival of 3-5 years. Thus, IPF and PPF represent a high unmet medical need such that the requirement for improved treatment options represents what the Directors believe to be a significant commercial opportunity. IPF is classified as a rare disease and presents a global commercial market that is forecast to grow to US$6.4bn by 2031. Sales of standard-of-care (\"SoC\") therapy OFEV achieved EUR3.8bn in 2024. Sales of Esbriet, also an IPF SoC therapy peaked\u00a0in 2020 at USD1.2bn prior to genericisation.\nTranilast has a long history of safe use as an oral drug for asthma, keloids and hypertrophic scarring, but while there is growing evidence that supports its potential use in other fibrotic conditions, including IPF, a combination of poor physicochemical properties, variable pharmacokinetics and challenging pharmacodynamics following oral delivery limit its potential use in ILDs. NXP002 is differentiated as it is a patent protected, novel form of tranilast that has been optimised for formulation and delivery direct to the lungs by inhalation, potentially overcoming the issues using tranilast orally as a chronic treatment for fibrosing ILDs.\nThe inhalation route is a well-known delivery strategy for the treatment of lung diseases to yield greater efficacy and reduce systemic, off-target side-effects compared to oral treatment. Discontinuation of treatment in IPF and PPF patients is currently an issue in the treatment of these diseases with discontinuation rates for current SoCs up to 80% in certain patient groups due to, in part, their debilitating systemic side effects. The Directors believe effective inhalation therapies offer the potential to overcome these limitations of oral therapies.\nThe positioning of NXP002 as an inhaled treatment for IPF and PPF could be either as added to SoC treatments or administered as a monotherapy for patients non-responsive to SoCs and those declining these therapies due to side effects which significantly impact their quality of life.\nThe preclinical inhalation strategy, initiated by the Company, has significantly progressed NXP002 demonstrating:\n\u00b7\ndrug can be delivered\nin-vivo\nby a range of nebulisers at the optimum droplet size for delivery to the deep lung;\n\u00b7\nvery high doses of drug appear to be well-tolerated; and\n\u00b7\nan\nin-vivo\ninhalation dose response was observed across both inflammation and fibrosis biomarkers that is consistent with all\nex-vivo\nhuman IPF tissue studies to date.\nThe Company conducted studies in a new iteration of a 3D human IPF lung tissue model, that has been advanced to significantly reduce output variability, offering greater disease and species relevance. The results for NXP002 alone and in combination with current SoC's, can be summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 is well tolerated in ex-vivo human lung tissue with no signs of toxicity events;\n\u00b7\nNXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by modulation of the release of multiple biomarkers of fibrosis and inflammation;\n\u00b7\nboth high and low concentrations of NXP002 show an additive anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect to SoC;\n\u00b7\nin particular, the higher concentrations of NXP002 with SoC's deliver a near complete ablation of fibrosis biomarker release, yet at lower concentrations than have been seen in other preclinical models to date; and\n\u00b7\nthe clear, pronounced additive benefit of NXP002 on top of SoCs observed suggests that NXP002 will provide additional efficacy, even in patients responding to SoC therapy.\nThis raises the possibility that NXP002 targets additional disease pathways to SoC's when increasing the combined anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory response. Following success in suppressing biomarkers of fibrotic disease progression in human IPF lung tissue, the same samples were analysed to assess additional mechanistic and anti-inflammatory benefits on top of SoC's and the results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines by over 90% for all cytokines studied; and\n\u00b7\nthe results further suggest that NXP002 may provide additional efficacy in combination with SoC's, even in patients not responding to SoC therapy alone.\nNuformix has developed a Target Product Profile (\"TPP\") that is consistent with twice daily inhalation administration. To assess NXP002's duration of action in relation to the TTP, the Company initiated work in an exploratory model using healthy human lung tissue. The model also bridges the Company's successful preclinical work across a variety of LPS-challenge studies. The results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines by healthy human lung tissue following LPS challenge; and\n\u00b7\na strong anti-inflammatory effect remains at 12 hours post drug dosing demonstrated by continued suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines following LPS challenge, confirming NXP002 has a suitable duration of action to support its TTP of twice daily dosing.\nData from the precision-cut lung slice (\"PCLS\") disease model referred to above using lung tissue from IPF patients were reanalysed as part of on-going discussions with potential licensing and development partners for NXP002. NXP002 had also been studied in tissue from an autoimmune ILD explanted lung (in this case from a patient diagnosed with non-specific interstitial pneumonia or NSIP). This collective data was revisited to compare key biomarker changes in tissue in response to NXP002 treatment using an 'area under the curve' (AUC) based approach, considering total biomarker expression during the treatment period. These new results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\na clear dose response to NXP002 was observed across both extra cellular matrix (\"ECM\") biomarkers and pro-fibrotic mediators suggesting NXP002's activity in additional pathways to standards of care;\n\u00b7\na consistent and significant effect of NXP002 was observed alone and in combination with standards of care across both biomarker types in all donors;\n\u00b7\nwhen the Col1A1 gene was found to be overexpressed in tissue, representing active fibrotic disease and tissue turner, NXP002 consistently attenuates its expression. When Col1A1 is not overexpressed Col1A1 is maintained, which may point towards NXP002's role in ECM homeostasis and supporting healthy tissue repair and regeneration, consistent with the evidence base describing positive results from clinical studies of tranilast in a range of fibrotic diseases; and\n\u00b7\nthe autoimmune-ILD donor studied also showed a significant response across both biomarker types alongside the seven IPF donors confirming that NXP002's activity translates well to autoimmune-derived ILDs.\nRecently the Group has developed new insights relating to its NXP002 lead programme. Following an in-depth pharmacology review, leveraging human and AI-methodologies, the pathways associated with disease progression in fibrotic diseases in which NXP002 has demonstrated both activity and clinical translation have been assessed across multiple organs. The resulting outputs allow clear demonstration of NXP002's potential to regulate four specific pathways that drive fibrotic disease. This includes core pathways, such as the TGF- \u00df pathway, but also evidences regulation of the WNT/\u00df-catenin and NLRP3 pathways, which are emerging as key disease progression pathways requiring suppression. The outputs also illustrate consistent translation from cell-based studies to clinical studies across multiple fibrotic organs, including the lung, in the resolution of extra cellular matrix deposition.\nThe Directors concluded that NXP002 as a potential treatment for IPF, was a likely candidate for Orphan Drug Designation (\"ODD\"), which could provide additional product protection against potential future competitors in addition to product development advantages.\nOn 29 May 2025, The Group announced that the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") had granted ODD in IPF for tranilast to the Group. ODD in the European Union (\"EU\") is granted by the European Commission based on a positive opinion adopted by the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products that can demonstrate potential for significant advancement in treatment of rare and debilitating diseases affecting no more than five in 10,000 individuals in the EU. ODD provides incentives to developers of medicines for limited patient populations, including 10 years market exclusivity, protocol assistance (guidance on study design and scientific evaluation) and regulatory fee reductions.\nOn 11 August 2025 the Group announced that it had submitted an application to the\u00a0US Food and Drug Administration\u00a0(\"FDA\") for ODD in IPF for tranilast. On 12 November 2025 the Group announced it had received a response from the FDA requesting further clarification for one specific element of the application which was responded to, and the Company currently awaits a further response from the FDA. If successful, the Group's NXP002 programme would be eligible for certain benefits such as tax credits for clinical trials or qualified clinical testing costs, a waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee when a marketing application is submitted, and the potential to receive seven years of marketing exclusivity upon product approval.\nThe Board continues to believe NXP002 offers a potentially significant treatment of progressive fibrosing ILDs, including IPF and PPF, and is focused on generating data and further developing discussions with potential partners that may support its efforts to secure a licensing, option or collaborative agreement for NXP002. As a consequence, the following activities are being prioritised:\n\u00b7\nAssessment of the likely inhaled human therapeutic window;\n\u00b7\nContinued investment into maintenance and prosecution of key NXP002 IP;\n\u00b7\nContinued work with industry experts and key opinion leaders to create a clinical development strategy, cost and timeline; and\n\u00b7\nProgression of partnering discussions with multiple parties with the aim of securing a licencing, option or collaborative agreement.\nNXP004 (novel forms of olaparib) - Oncology\nThe Group discovered novel forms of olaparib, a drug currently marketed by AstraZeneca, as Lynparza\u00ae. Lynparza\u00ae was approved for the treatment of adults with advanced ovarian cancer and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation and has since secured similar approvals in breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. These approvals have propelled Lynparza\u00ae sales to US$2.6bn in 2022 with industry analysts forecasting annual sales of US$9.7bn by 2028.\nSubsequently, further preformulation and in-vitro studies allowed Nuformix to identify lead cocrystals to be progressed for further development. Results from in vitro dissolution studies demonstrated that the two lead NXP004 cocrystals out-performed Lynparza\u00ae, both in terms of rate and extent of dissolution and release of olaparib.\nEnhancement of dissolution in the currently marketed formulation of Lynparza\u00ae resulted in improved bioavailability versus the initial marketed product. Therefore, the Directors believe that NXP004 may offer potential to further increase olaparib's bioavailability. In addition, the Directors believe that the potential simplicity of NXP004-based formulations may offer improvements in product cost-of-goods versus the currently marketed product, which requires complex manufacturing methods.\nThe Directors believe that these attributes position NXP004 for applications in line-extensions for the currently marketed product, or for possible development in future first-to-generic product opportunities.\nNXP001 (new form of aprepitant) - Oncology\nNXP001 is a proprietary new form of the drug aprepitant that is currently marketed as a product in the oncology supportive care setting (chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting) initially exclusively licensed to Oxilio Limited (\"Oxilio\") for oncology indications. In September 2023, Oxilio acquired ownership of Nuformix's NXP001 patent portfolio. Nuformix retained rights to receive further development milestones and royalties capped at \u00a32 million per year under the terms of acquisition.\nCurrently however, NXP002 is the Company's priority.\nFundraising\nOn 4 November 2024 , the Company completed a placing (the \"Placing\") of 440,000,000 new ordinary shares and a\u00a0subscription for 160,000,000 new ordinary shares to raise gross proceeds of\u00a0\u00a3300,000 at a price of\u00a00.05 pence\u00a0per share (the \"Issue Price\") (the \"Fundraise\"). The Issue Price was below the\u00a00.1 pence\u00a0nominal value of the existing ordinary shares therefore a share capital reorganisation was conducted. The new shares represented 42% of the enlarged share capital.\nThe Placing was arranged by CMC Markets. The Company also issued 26,400,000 'broker' warrants to CMC Markets, giving them the right to acquire such number of new ordinary shares at an exercise price of\u00a00.05 pence\u00a0for a period of two years from the date of admission, being 5 November 2024. The warrants were subsequently exercised on 14 April 2025 for a total consideration of \u00a313,200.\nOn 11th February 2025, a subscription for 250,000,000 new ordinary shares at a price of 0.0675 pence per share raised gross proceeds of \u00a3168,750. Additionally, on 30th May 2025, a placing for 300,000,000 new ordinary shares at a price of 0.07 pence per share raised gross proceeds of \u00a3210,000.\nPost period end, on 11 November 2025, an Open Offer was completed. The Open Offer, underwritten by CMC Markets, raised \u00a3228,081 (before expenses) through the issue of 114,040,535 Open Offer Shares at an Issue Price of 0.2p per Share, including a share premium of \u00a3114,041.\nThe net proceeds of the above are being used by the Company primarily to drive forward partnering discussions for its NXP002 programme, as well as to provide funding for general corporate purposes.\nFuture fundraising will be required in order to provide sufficient time to conclude business development discussions in respect of NXP002.\nBusiness Development\nThe Group is focused on generating data and initiating or further developing discussions with potential partners to support its efforts to secure a licensing option agreement or codevelopment agreement.\nSummary and Outlook\nThe strategy of the Group is to optimise value from NXP002, its lead asset, while maintaining tight control of costs. The proceeds from the post-period Fundraise have enabled the Group to gain Orphan Drug Designation for NXP002, make a submission in the US and continue with business development activities as set out above.\nWe would like to thank all stakeholders and in particular our shareholders for their continued support and we look forward to the remainder of the year and beyond with confidence that significant value can be realised from our portfolio of assets over time.\nJulian Gilbert\nMadeleine Kennedy\nNon-Executive Chairman\nNon-Executive Director\n26 January 2026\n26 January 2026\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nCMC Markets\nDouglas Crippen\n+44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing. The Company aims to use its expertise in discovering, developing and patenting novel drug forms, with improved physical properties, to develop new products in new indications that are, importantly, differentiated from the original (by way of dosage, delivery route or presentation), thus creating new and attractive commercial opportunities. Nuformix has a pipeline of preclinical assets with potential for significant value and early licensing opportunities.\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.nuformix.com\n.\nStrategic Report\nReview of the Business\nA review of the period of these accounts is given in the Non-Executive Directors' Statement\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe Group's risk management policy is regularly reviewed and updated in line with the changing needs of the business. Risk is inherent in all business. Set out below are certain risk factors which could have an impact on the Group's long-term performance and mitigating factors adopted to alleviate these risks. This does not purport to be an exhaustive list of the risks affecting the Group.\nThe primary risks identi\ufb01ed by the Board are:\nStrategic risks\nFunding the business\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are very competitive, with many major players having substantial R&D departments with greater resources and \ufb01nancial support. The Group aims to execute licensing deals early in the development process in order to generate revenue to support the business. The Group's lead asset is targeted towards IPF, a disease area where there is good precedent for licensing deals at early stages of development. Without licensing revenue, reliance falls on raising funds from investors or potential M&A opportunities. Failure to generate additional funding from these sources, if required, would compromise the Group's ability to achieve its strategic objectives as set out in the outlook.\nThere is a material uncertainty around achieving an early licensing, option or collaborative deal for NXP002 and raising additional funds. However, it is the Directors' reasonable expectation that the Group can achieve an out-licensing agreement or further fundraising and therefore can state that it has adequate resources to continue to operate as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of the approval of the accounts. In forming this assessment, the Directors have prepared cash\ufb02ow forecasts covering the period ending 31 March 2027 that take into account the likely run rate on overheads and research and development expenditure and the prudent expectations of income from out-licensing rights to its programmes or a fundraising.\nFeasibility of drug candidates\nPharmaceutical R&D is an inherently risky activity and drug candidates can fail due to a lack of ef\ufb01cacy, lack of potency, unsuitable pharmacokinetic properties, unacceptable toxicology profile, poor stability of the drug or formulation, poor performance of the drug product, or other technical issues unforeseen at the time of candidate selection. This is the main reason that conventional pharmaceutical R&D takes many years and billions of dollars to progress a drug from discovery through to an approved medicine. It is possible that the drug candidates selected by the Group are found to be non- viable for further development although the Group's model of repurposing and working on known drugs allows us to mitigate this risk to a certain extent.\nFailure to generate and protect our IP\nIf our IP rights are not adequately secured or defended against infringement, or conversely become subject to infringement claims by others, commercial exploitation could be completely inhibited. The Group constantly monitors its patents and is prepared to defend them rigorously.\nBy virtue of conducting research on known drugs, competitors may file patent applications on the same drugs as the Group, and thus there is a risk of securing new granted patents. There is a delay of up to 18 months in publishing patent applications and thus it is not always known whether the Group's inventions will be novel. This is mitigated through knowledge and expertise in identifying new IP and promptly filing patent applications.\nUnrealistic goals and timeframes\nThe Board has a duty to maintain a realistic view of the chances of success of products, deals and partnerships. Should this not be managed accurately and appropriately, the Group and its Board and staff risk \ufb01nancial, business and reputational damage, whilst its shareholders become exposed to investment risk and uncertainty over the Group's viability and status. The Board continually reviews expectations and communications in the public domain to reduce the risk of misalignment.\nReliance on partners\nTo progress the development of a drug candidate requires resources, \ufb01nancial and otherwise, that are not necessarily available to the Group. The drug candidates that the Group wishes to develop may be of interest to third parties capable of providing these resources, so a partnership (e.g., a co-development partnership) may provide mutual bene\ufb01ts and mitigate risks for the Group. However, the speci\ufb01c strategic focus of a partner may not align totally with the Group's objectives. Maintaining a balance in a partnership is therefore a risk, such as timing, cost sharing, development decisions. Currently the Group is progressing two of its three pipeline assets without external co-development partners and thus this risk is currently minimised.\nOperational risks\nManagement, employees, consultants and contractors\nWith a fully virtual Group operating model with a reliance on consultants and contractors, the Group's ability to manage day to day tasks and its relationships with its customers and suppliers could be undermined by failure to recruit key personnel. The Group endeavours to offer attractive remuneration and a positive working environment for all people involved in its projects. The Board are incentivised as detailed in the Directors' Remuneration Report.\nBusiness development risks in terms of timing and success of deal \ufb02ow\nThe Group seeks to extract value from its existing pipeline through early licensing deals once sufficient data are generated, to provide revenue. Generation of more robust data packages will lead to a greater probability of successful licensing discussions.\nAdapting to the external environment\nThe ability of the Group to quickly adapt to external events such as a pandemic may impact the delivery of our strategy. Our primary focus remains the safety of our employees during any external event impacting the business. The Group follows Government advice throughout any external event and risks are also minimised by the Group's virtual business model, allowing the Board to work remotely and effectively. Close liaison with contractors ensures that Group projects are progressed according to agreed timelines and costs.\nFinancial risk management\nFailure to achieve strategic plans or meet targets or expectations\nThe Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure an optimal capital structure and equity holder returns, taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital ef\ufb01ciency, prevailing and projected pro\ufb01tability, projected operating cash \ufb02ows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment opportunities. Further detail on the Group's risk management policies and procedures are set out in Note 15 of the \ufb01nancial statements.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u00b7\nNet assets at 30 September 2025 of \u00a3754,934 (2024: \u00a3715,571) which included \u00a397,550 cash at bank (2024: \u00a320,210)\n\u00b7\nThe Group delivered a loss on ordinary activities (after tax credit) for the year of \u00a3652,586 (2024: loss of \u00a33,641,487) and a loss per share of 0.04p (2024: 0.14p). The reported loss is driven mainly by costs related to the further development of pipeline assets and the impairment of goodwill.\nFuture outlook\nThe Non-Executive Directors' Statement on pages 4 to 9 gives information on the outlook of the Group.\nPerformance\nThe following are the key performance indicators (\"KPIs\") considered by the Board in assessing the Group's performance against its objectives. These KPIs are:\nFinancial KPIs\nThe Group is currently at a stage where the Board considers availability of cash to fund the planned R&D activities to be the primary KPI. At 30 September 2025 cash balances totalled \u00a397,550 (2024: \u00a320,210). The Board will consider introducing additional KPIs to monitor the Group's development as they become relevant in the future.\nMeeting \ufb01nancial targets:\nThe Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure an optimal capital structure, taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital ef\ufb01ciency, prevailing and projected pro\ufb01tability, projected operating cash \ufb02ows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment opportunities. Further detail on the Group's risk management policies and procedures are set out in Note 18 of the \ufb01nancial statements.\nRevenue from agreements:\nDuring the period of these accounts, activities are underway to progress an early licensing deal, to provide revenue though none was received in the period.\nNon-Financial KPIs\nProgress of Lead Programmes:\nThe Group strategy is to generate revenue streams through applying and further developing its IP to produce proprietary product opportunities for short-term development and early out-licensing, option or collaborative opportunities. Thus, progression of its assets towards licensing, option or collaborative is crucial to the business. The Group's focus is on NXP002 and responding to technical questions from potential licensing/collaborative partners. The Company is currently conducting an assessment of the likely inhaled human therapeutic window in response to those discussions.\nTo support discussions with prospective partners the Company submitted Orphan Drug Designation (\"ODD\") application to the EMA for Europe and the FDA for the US. Subsequently, EMA granted ODD in IPF for tranilast to the Group. The FDA requested further information on one specific item in response to the Company's application. The Company is in the process of submitting a response to the FDA using existing data and information in the Company's possession.\nDuring the period, appropriate respiratory disease conferences were attended to confirm the likely interest and positioning of NXP002 with potential licensing, option or collaborative partners. As a consequence, discussions with potential partners have been progressed following previous discussions and initiated with newly interested parties.\nProgression of Out-Licensed Programmes:\nNXP001\n: Oxilio has now acquired ownership of Nuformix's NXP001 patent portfolio, relating to proprietary new forms of the drug aprepitant that is currently marketed as a product in the oncology supportive care setting (chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting) and is now responsible for further development activities. Nuformix retained rights to receive further development milestones and royalties capped at \u00a32 million per year under the terms of acquisition. Oxilio is currently conducting fundraising activities to progress the development of products in its pipeline and that of its subsidiary, Biovara.\nProgression of Patents and Intellectual Property:\nNXP002:\nNXP002 is the Company's lead asset and a potential novel inhaled treatment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"IPF\"). The Group's focus has been, and continues to be, investing in the maintenance and prosecution of key NXP002 intellectual property and driving forward partnering discussions with multiple parties with the aim of securing an out-licence or option agreement for NXP002.\nThe Company holds multiple NXP002 patents with progression of its patents during the period summarised as follows:\nNXP002 Substance of Matter:\nFollowing a grant in the US,, the Japanese and\u00a0European Patent Offices\u00a0formally issued grants of the patent covering the Company's proprietary NXP002 drug form being progressed by the Company as a potential novel IPF treatment.\nNXP002 Method of Use:\nThe\u00a0US PTO\u00a0issued a grant of patent application 17/365,490 on\u00a014 June 2024, covering use of the Company's proprietary drug forms in the treatment of various diseases including fibrotic lung diseases.\nNXP002 Compositions for Treatment:\nThis patent is in national filing stages and proceeding through examination.\nDuring the period, appropriate respiratory disease conferences were attended to confirm the likely interest and positioning of NXP002 with potential licensing partners. As a consequence, discussions with potential partners have been initiated and are ongoing.\nNXP004:\nWhile NXP004 is not currently a priority for the Company, we continue to invest in and develop its intellectual property.\u00a0On 14 June 2024\u00a0the\u00a0US Patent and Trademark Office\u00a0(\"PTO\") granted the Company patent number 12012386 covering the lead cocrystals under development, representing the first granted patent in this second NXP004 cocrystal series.\nSection 172\nThe Board considers the interests of the Group's employees and other stakeholders, including the impact of its activities on the community, environment and the Group's reputation, when making decisions. The Board ensures that its decisions offer the best chance to promote the success of the Group as a whole and consider the likely and long-term consequences for all stakeholders, particularly (though not exclusively) considering the following:\n- How the views and interests of all stakeholders were represented in the boardroom during the period of these accounts. Open and honest discussion at Board level considers the impact on the Group's stakeholders when reviewing items \ufb02owing to the Board as part of its activities, whether this is reviewing strategy, budget or a business development opportunity.\n- Given the size and stage of development of the Group, the Board has not formally adopted a mechanism to obtain stakeholder feedback.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\nOur scoping considerations for the Group audit were based both on financial information and risk. As noted above, limited assurance audit work - which is to say the audit of balances and transactions material at a group level - was not utilised due to statutory audit requirements of all group entities. The table below summarises for the parent company and its subsidiaries, the level of assurance gained:\nGroup component\nLevel of assurance\nNuformix PLC\nFull statutory audit (Kreston Reeves Audit LLP)\nNuformix Technologies Limited\nFull statutory audit (Kreston Reeves Audit LLP)\nOur application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality and performance materiality for the financial statements of the Group and of the Parent Company as follows:\nGroup financial statements\nParent company financial statements\nMateriality\n\u00a320,200 (2024: \u00a334,000)\n\u00a319,100 (2024: \u00a332,100)\nBasis for determining materiality\n2% of Gross Assets\n2% of Company Gross Assets\nRationale for benchmark applied\nThe group is focused on the development of its Intellectual Property (IP) and the assets held in order to finance the continuing development of this IP. As such, the most appropriate basis for the group financial statements is gross assets.\nThe parent company is principally holding subsidiary investment. The users of the financial statements will be most concerned with the value of investment. As such, the most appropriate basis for the parent company materiality is gross assets.\nPerformance materiality\n\u00a315,200 (2024: \u00a325,500)\n\u00a312,900 (2024: \u00a324,075)\nBasis for determining performance materiality\n75% of materiality\n85% of group performance materiality\nReporting threshold\n\u00a31,000 (2024: \u00a3300)\n\u00a31,000 (2024: \u00a3300)\nBasis for determining reporting threshold\n5% of materiality\n5% of materiality\nWe reported all audit differences found in excess of our reporting threshold to the audit committee.\nFor each Group component within the scope of our Group audit, we determined performance materiality that is less than our overall Group performance materiality. The performance materiality determined for each Group company was \u00a312,900.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\nThese matters, including going concern, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\nImpairment of goodwill / Valuation of investment \u00a3882,784 (2024: \u00a3882,784)\nSignificance and nature of key risk\nThe Group held significant goodwill generated from an investment in the subsidiary of \u00a3882,784 (previously impaired from an initial investment of \u00a34m). In addition, the parent company held an equal investment value of \u00a3882,784 on its company balance sheet relating to the same subsidiary.\nWe identified there was a risk in relation to the impairment on the goodwill / investment held with regards to the trading subsidiary.\nManagement's assessment of the recoverable amount of investment in a subsidiary requires estimation and judgement around assumptions used, including the cash flows to be generated from the continuing operations of the subsidiary. Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in the estimated recoverable amount, impacting the value of investment in the subsidiary and impairment charges.\nFor the purpose of assessing impairment on goodwill arising from business combination, goodwill is allocated to a single cash generating units ('CGU') and the recoverable amount of the CGU was determined with reference to value-in-use (the 'VIU') calculations using cash flow projections. In carrying out the impairment assessment, significant management judgement was used to determine the key assumptions underlying the VIU calculations.\nWe have identified the above matter as a key audit matter because goodwill is material to the Group and the valuation of the investment is material to the parent company. The estimation of recoverable amount of the CGU involved a significant degree of management judgement and therefore was subject to an inherent risk of error.\nHow our audit addressed the key risk\nDuring the course of the audit, we undertook the following key procedures:\n\u00b7\nassessing the appropriateness of the VIU calculations used by the management to estimate recoverable amount of CGU;\n\u00b7\nreconciling key input data applied in the VIU calculations to reliable supporting evidence; and\n\u00b7\nchallenging the reasonableness of key assumptions based on our knowledge and understanding of the business and industry.\n\u00b7\nReviewed management's plan of future operating cashflows of the subsidiary; and\n\u00b7\nobtaining evidence of the commercial and technical feasibility of the patents owned by the subsidiary.\nThere were also other procedures which are not deemed to be key and have therefore not been listed above.\nBased on the audit work performed, we were satisfied that the value of goodwill and investments is materially accurate for this financial period and justifiable valuation of the underlying business activities.\nKey observations communicated to the Audit & Risk Committee\nWe have no significant concerns over the material accuracy of the valuation / impairment of investment values recognised in the financial statements.\nMaterial uncertainty relating to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 1 in the financial statements, which indicates that there is a significant threat to the going concern status of the group.\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development group that has undertaken significant research into targeting the pharmaceutical product gap needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing. In order to continue this work long term, the group will need to expend significantly, at a cost currently unquantifiable. Cash held at the balance sheet date of \u00a397k (2024: \u00a320k) is therefore not sufficient and poses a going concern threat. Given that the group is currently reliant on a single product, NXP002, for its long-term future sustainable financial success this financial position underscores the inherent risk of having all resources concentrated in one area.\nGiven the stage in the business life cycle, the group is incurring significant losses at present. The loss was \u00a3653k for the year ended 30 September 2025 (2024: Loss of \u00a33,641k). This has led to the group's accumulated losses at the balance sheet date of \u00a310,462k (2024: accumulated losses of \u00a39,844k). These losses are attributable to the day-to-day running of the business and the ongoing drug research program which is yet to reach commercial production stage where revenue could potentially be generated.\nThe group successfully secured an additional \u00a3228k through fundraising in November 2025 however, this will not be sufficient to secure 12 months of operational activity.\nAs a result of the significant threat to going concern, we have completed the following audit work as part of our evaluation of going concern:\n\u00b7\nOverheads and debt costs assumptions - we considered projected overheads for the 2025/26 and 2026/27 periods to ensure that these were reasonable after considering both the current and expected future profile of the business moving forward. As part of this future profiling, the directors have elected not to take payment of their salaries until such time as the business holds sufficient funds to do so.\n\u00b7\nCredit / cash control management assumptions - we identified within the forecasting the most significant cash inflows, primarily from the new share capital issue, and ensured that the valuation and timing of these inflows were reasonable.\n\u00b7\nWe performed sensitivity analysis to assess the level of working capital headroom should key assumptions be less favourable than included in management's model.\n\u00b7\nWe considered post year end performance data available, including the group's future commitments, to gain additional assurance over the effectiveness of management's intention to remain as a going concern.\nBased on the work we have performed we have gained sufficient assurance in order to rely on management's forecasting in forming our assessment. We have also gained assurance over the credibility of management's ambitions over the next 12 months, which drives the sustainability of Nuformix. We have further confirmed the adequacy of working capital available in order to settle external liabilities as they fall due and where this is not available, we have reviewed the directors' assessment that they can raise the funding required through future share capital raises.\nHowever, whilst we have evaluated future cash inflows as reasonable, there are significant levels of uncertainty surrounding both their valuation and timing, and at the dates of the audit report, future funding has not been secured. The group is currently focusing solely on licensing its lead asset NXP002. Should this not be completed, Nuformix could incur detrimental effects on the valuation of the group's goodwill, \u00a3882,784 (2024: \u00a3882,784), the parent company's valuation of subsidiary investment, \u00a3882,784 (2024: \u00a3882,784), and ultimately the going concern assessment of the Group, as without a commercial agreement in respect of NXP002, the group will not be a going concern, and these balances will be worth nil.\nManagement will continue to reduce non-essential costs in the 2026 financial period wherever possible, including the directors continuing to not draw salaries, and direct all their focus on NXP002 with a view to obtaining a partnership contract to achieved sustained revenue income. The previous NXP001 licensing agreement includes some deferred considerations which are dependent on specific milestones being achieved - their successes are currently unknown and therefore cannot be relied upon for going concern purposes.\nTherefore, the above uncertainties indicate that a significant threat to the business exists which leads to our assessment that there is material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our Auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOur opinion on the Remuneration report\nKreston Reeves Audit has audited the Remuneration report set out on pages 23 to 27 of the Annual Report for the financial year. The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Kreston Reeves Audit's responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with International Accounting Standards. In Kreston Reeves Audit's opinion, the Remuneration report of the Group for the period complies with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u00b7\nthe information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u00b7\nthe strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit\nCorporate Governance Statement\nWe have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's and Parent Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the UK Listing Rules.\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our\u00a0knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\u00b7\nDirectors' statement with regards the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified\n\u00b7\nDirector's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities\n\u00b7\nBoard's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks\n\u00b7\nSection of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems Section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems\n\u00b7\nSection describing the work of the audit committee\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and Parent\nCompany's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\nCapability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, and through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to health and safety, anti-bribery and employment law. We considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006, Statement of Recommended Practice, taxation and pension legislation. We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls) and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce expenditure and management bias in accounting estimates and judgemental areas of the financial statements such as the valuation of intangible assets and investments. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team included:\n\u2022 Discussions with management and assessment of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud, and review of the reports made by management;\n\u2022 Assessment of identified fraud risk factors;\n\u2022 Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates;\n\u2022 Confirmation of related parties with management, and review of transactions throughout the period to identify any previously undisclosed transactions with related parties outside the normal course of business;\n\u2022 Performing analytical procedures with automated data analytics tools to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships, including related party transactions, that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;\n\u2022 Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with relevant tax and regulatory authorities; and\n\u2022 Review of significant and unusual transactions and evaluation of the underlying financial rationale supporting the transactions.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (UK), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.\nWe describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\nOther matters which we are required to address\nWe were reappointed by the Audit Committee in the period as auditors, Kreston Reeves Audit LLP (previously known as Kreston Reeves LLP). Our total uninterrupted period of engagement as a firm is three years, covering the financial year ended 30 September 2025.\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent company, and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent company in conducting our audit.\nWe provided no other services to the entity or its subsidiary undertakings during the period under review.\nOur audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\nUse of our Report\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.

General information\nNuformix plc (the \"Company\") and its subsidiary (together, the \"Group\") operate in the \ufb01eld of pharmaceutical development targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.\nThe Company is a public limited company which is listed on the Standard List of the London Stock Exchange, domiciled in the United Kingdom (the \"UK\") and incorporated in England and Wales.\nThe address of its registered of\ufb01ce is C/O Arch Law Limited Huckletree Bishopsgate, 8 Bishopsgate, London, United Kingdom, EC2N 4BQ. The company operates in a virtual manner and as such does not have a principal place of business.\nSummary of Significant Accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThese Group and Parent Company financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards.\nThe financial statements of the Group and Parent Company have been prepared on accrual basis and under historical cost convention. The \ufb01nancial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the Group's functional and presentational currency.\nNew Standards and Interpretations\nNo new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the period beginning on or after 1 January 2024 have had a material impact on the Group.\nStandards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted are as follows:\nStandard\nImpact on initial application\nEffective date\nIAS 1\nClassification of liabilities as current or non-current\n1 January 2024\nIAS 1\nNon-current Liabilities with Covenants\n1 January 2024\nIFRS 7\nIFRS 16\nSupplier finance agreements\nLeases on sale and leaseback\n1 January 2024\n1 January 2024\nIAS 21\nLack of exchangeability\n1 January 2025\nIFRS 9 & 7\nClassification and Measurement of Financial Instruments\n1 January 2026\nIFRS 18\nPresentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n1 January 2027\nThe Directors are evaluating the impact of the new and amended standards above. The Directors believe that these new and amended standards are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.\nGoing concern\nThe \ufb01nancial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of preparation which, inter alia, is based on the Directors' reasonable expectation that the Group and Parent Company has adequate resources to continue to operate as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements. In forming this assessment, the Directors have prepared cash\ufb02ow forecasts covering the period ending 31 March 2027 that take into account the likely run rate on overheads and research and development expenditure and the estimates of the possibilities of raising funds through issues of equity and have considered alternative strategies should projected income be delayed or fail to materialise.\nThe Group is not in a position for self-financing and will require further funding which has not yet been secured. Whilst the Directors understand the risks and issues around raising further funds through an equity raise, this will be carefully considered, as and when appropriate.\nThese circumstances indicate the existence of an inherent material uncertainty (as referenced in the Independent Auditor's Report) which may cast a significant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Future funding options have already been considered and will continue to be progressed by the Directors accordingly. The \ufb01nancial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the Company or Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Directors have carried out a thorough review of costs and are clear on the development work to be completed. Discretionary costs have been carefully reviewed and reduced where reasonable to do so while continuing to allow the prudent running of the business. In addition, the non-executive directors may elect not to take payment of their salaries until such time as the business holds sufficient funds to enable them to do so.\nAfter careful consideration, the Directors consider that they have reasonable grounds to believe that the Group can be regarded as a going concern and for this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group's \ufb01nancial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\nThe preparation of these \ufb01nancial statements under UK-adopted International Accounting Standards requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the \ufb01nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. These estimates and assumptions are based upon management's knowledge and experience of the amounts, events or actions. Actual results may differ from such estimates.\nThe critical accounting estimates are considered to relate to the following:\ni) Intangible assets\nThe Group recognises intangible assets in respect of goodwill arising on consolidation. This recognition requires the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions in determining whether the goodwill is impaired at each year end, assessing its recoverable amount in accordance with IAS36. Accounting estimates and judgements are required to calculate the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the asset, the latter using a NPV calculation assuming a 20% discount rate. After assessing the carrying value of intangible assets, the balance of \u00a3882,784 (2024: \u00a3882,784) was considered to be appropriate and no impairment deemed necessary.\nii) Share options\nThe Group fair values equity-settled share-based payment transactions using the Black-Scholes model. The use of the models involves judgements and estimates including an assessment of whether the shares will vest. Should actual future outcomes differ from these assessments the amounts recognised on a straight-line basis would vary from those currently recognised. The total charge in the year to 30 September 2025 was \u00a3nil (2024: \u00a312,479)\niii) Revenue recognition\nRevenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of services in the ordinary course of the Group's activities. Revenue is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.\nThe Group recognises revenue when:\n\u2022 the amount of revenue can be reliably measured;\n\u2022 it is probable that future economic bene\ufb01ts will \ufb02ow to the entity; and,\n\u2022 speci\ufb01c criteria have been met for each of the Group activities, such as the demonstration of milestone achievements in research or acceptance by both parties.\nAfter applying the above criteria, no revenue was recognised in the year.\nSegmental information\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers, who are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the executive Board of Directors.\nAll operations and information are reviewed together so that at present there is only one reportable operating segment.\nIn the opinion of the Directors, during the year the Group operated in the single business segment of the research and development of pharmaceutical products using technology developed by the Group.\nTaxation\nTaxation comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is based on taxable profit or loss for the year. Taxable pro\ufb01t differs from net pro\ufb01t or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's current tax asset is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nGoodwill and Intangible assets\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identi\ufb01able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is held in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing rate at each reporting year date.\nGoodwill is not amortised, but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (\"CGUs\") for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to bene\ufb01t from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The Group currently has only one CGU.\nOther intangible assets, including customer relationships, licences, patents and trademarks, that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.\nAmortisation is provided on the Group's patents to write off the cost, less any estimated residual value, over their expected useful economic life on a 10% straight line basis.\nImpairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\nFor impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of a related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.\nCash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated (determined by the Group's management as equivalent to its operating segments) are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAn impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's (or cash-generating unit's) carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The data used for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group's latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount factors are determined individually for each cash-generating unit and reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and asset-specific risk factors.\nImpairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigni\ufb01cant risk of changes in value.\nFinancial instruments\nIFRS 9 requires an entity to address the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities.\ni)\nClassification\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\u2022 those to be measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification depends on the Company's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. The Company classifies financial assets as at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met:\n\u2022 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\u2022 the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest.\nii) Recognition\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date (that is, the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset). Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\niii) Measurement\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\nDebt instruments\nAmortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\niv) Impairment\nThe Company assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with any debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group's financial liabilities include other payables. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, and, where applicable, adjusted for transaction costs unless the Group designated a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss.\nSubsequently, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, which are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss (other than derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedging instruments).\nAll interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument's fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included within finance costs or finance income.\nEquity\nEquity comprises the following:\n\u2022 \"Share capital\" represents the nominal value of equity shares.\n\u2022 \"Share premium\" represents the amount paid for equity shares over the nominal value.\n\u2022 \"Reverse acquisition reserve\" arises due to the elimination of the Company's investment in Nuformix Technologies Limited.\n\u2022 \"Merger relief reserve\" represents the share premium arising on issue of shares in respect of the reverse acquisition takeover.\n\u2022 \"Share option reserve\" represents the fair value of options issued.\n\u2022 \"Retained earnings\" represents retained earnings/losses.\nShare based payments\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 12.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in pro\ufb01t or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.\nEquity\n\u2011\nsettled share\n\u2011\nbased payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.\nFor cash\n\u2011\nsettled share\n\u2011\nbased payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At each reporting date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in pro\ufb01t or loss for the year.\nEarnings per Ordinary Share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its Ordinary Shares.\nBasic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to Shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.\nDiluted earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by adjusting the earnings and number of Ordinary Shares for the effects of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.\n2.

Management regards total equity as capital and reserves, for capital management purposes.\n16.

Following an in-depth pharmacology review, leveraging human and AI-methodologies, the pathways associated with disease progression in fibrotic diseases in which NXP002 has demonstrated both activity and clinical translation have been assessed across multiple organs.\nThe resulting outputs allow clear demonstration of NXP002's potential to regulate four specific pathways that drive fibrotic disease. This includes core pathways, such as the TGF- \u00df pathway, but also evidences regulation of the WNT/\u00df-catenin and NLRP3 pathways, which are emerging as key disease progression pathways requiring suppression. The outputs also illustrate consistent translation from cell-based studies to clinical studies across multiple fibrotic organs, including the lung, in the resolution of extra cellular matrix deposition.\nThe Company has summarised its findings in a new document 'NXP002 Pathway and Translation Update' which is available via the following link\nhttp://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/7219A_1-2025-9-24.pdf\nand will be published on the Company's website.\nThe Company continues to have ongoing discussions with potential development partners and will further showcase NXP002 at the ERS Congress.\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director, Nuformix, said:\n\"\nWe are very much looking forward to attending the ERS Congress in Amsterdam. We believe that inhalation is now a validated and attractive treatment option for IPF and PPF. We also believe that delivering improved treatments to patients requires regulation of multiple disease pathways involved in fibrosis progression, given the complexity of the underlying disease. Our recent analysis allows us to evidence with new clarity the specific pathways NXP002 is supressing and how this multi-pathway approach may enable improved treatment of these devastating lung diseases, with the potential to restore tissue function supported by a clinical evidence base.\n\"We await news on our US FDA orphan drug designation application and continue discussions with potential licensing partners. We will provide further updates in due course as appropriate.\n\"\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nCMC Markets\nDouglas Crippen\n+44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.

They also often face tolerability issues with existing therapies. Inhaled therapies like NXP002 offer the potential for improved efficacy by delivering the drug directly to the lungs, while avoiding the side effects associated with oral treatments. This approach could represent a meaningful step forward in addressing the urgent need for better treatment options for patients with IPF.\"\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director, Nuformix, said:\n\"\nWe are delighted to receive confirmation that Orphan Drug Designation has been granted for our NXP002 programme in IPF. The EMA award recognises NXP002's potential to significantly advance IPF treatment, thanks to its ability to modulate key targets in IPF progression, but also given its potential enhancement of current standard of care therapies.\nOrphan Drug Designation should significantly support our goal of progressing NXP002 through partnering and further development activities and, ultimately bringing solutions for fibrotic ILD indications to patients. We're thrilled that like us, the EMA has recognised the promise of this potential breakthrough medicine.\nWe will now submit an application for US FDA orphan drug designation and continue discussions with potential future licensing partners and will provide further updates in due course as appropriate.\n\"\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nCMC Markets\nDouglas Crippen\n+44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.

The COMP also concluded that NXP002's additive effect in combination with anti-fibrotic agents, as well its potential to be used in patients intolerant to these medicines constituted a clinically relevant advantage.\nThe Company now awaits the European Commission's final ratification of the EMA opinion, which is expected to be received within a 30-day period.\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director, Nuformix, said:\n\"We are delighted to receive news of the COMPs positive opinion regarding NXP002's eligibility for Orphan Drug Designation in IPF, a high-mortality rare disease, in urgent need of new treatments.\n\"The EMA's procedure for awarding ODD status involves considerable scientific scrutiny. Therefore, the opinion serves as powerful independent third-party validation of NXP002's underlying scientific rationale and existing data supporting its potential efficacy in treating fibrotic lung diseases such as IPF. In addition to this validation, there are numerous developmental and commercial incentives to securing ODD status for NXP002, including 10 years marketing exclusivity, all of which would be transferable to future licensing partners. The COMP's opinion also underscores the significant unmet need for patients, in spite of the fact that treatments have been approved in the EU. We will now progress to applying for US FDA orphan drug designation. Given the EMA's positive opinion, we are hopeful that the US FDA would conclude similarly.

In addition to patients with IPF and progressive pulmonary fibrosis (\"PPF\"), patients suffering from autoimmune ILDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or systemic scleroderma) also have a high-mortality progressive fibrotic disease course which is not currently adequately treated.\nIn addition to lung tissue from seven IPF patients, NXP002 has been studied in tissue from an autoimmune ILD explanted lung (in this case from a patient diagnosed with non-specific interstitial pneumonia or NSIP).\nThis data\nwas revisited to compare key biomarker changes in tissue in response to NXP002 treatment using an 'area under the curve' (AUC) based approach, considering total biomarker expression during the treatment period.\nThese new results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nA clear dose response to NXP002 was observed\nacross both extra cellular matrix (\"ECM\") biomarkers and pro-fibrotic mediators suggesting NXP002's activity in additional pathways to standards of care;\n\u00b7\nA consistent and significant effect of NXP002 was observed alone and in combination with\nstandards of care\nacross both biomarker types in all donors;\n\u00b7\nWhen the Col1A1 gene was found to be overexpressed in tissue, representing active fibrotic disease and tissue turner, NXP002 consistently attenuates it's expression. When Col1A1 is not overexpressed Col1A1 is maintained, which may point towards NXP002's role in ECM homeostasis and supporting healthy tissue repair and regeneration, consistent with the evidence base describing positive results from clinical studies of tranilast in a range of fibrotic diseases; and\n\u00b7\nThe autoimmune-ILD donor studied also showed a significant response across both biomarker types alongside the seven IPF donors confirming that NXP002's activity translates well to autoimmune-derived ILDs.\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director, Nuformix, said:\n\"The PCLS lung tissue model has become the gold-standard disease model thanks to various close-to-patient benefits. We believe the dataset we have generated,\nin what we believe is one of the largest IPF patient tissue sample sets studied, gives us great confidence in NXP002. In what is a highly variable and heterogenous disease, to see such consistent activity across all donors towards pro-fibrotic mediators in both IPF and autoimmune ILD is impressive. The emergence of data supporting additional activity towards Col1A1 overexpression is exciting because this profile would be in contrast to high-potency, single target therapeutics, whose activity may negatively impact healthy tissue repair processes, leading to increased risk in long term use as observed in numerous recent IPF clinical studies\n. For patients with ILD's of an autoimmune origin, g\niven such patients' background systemic therapies, an inhaled approach towards treatment would be highly advantageous in both development and treatment. We are excited by the results and continue discussions with potential partners, who also see advantages in NXP002 in terms of therapeutic optionality and future product positioning. I look forward to providing further updates in due course.\"\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nCMC Markets\nDouglas Crippen\n+44 (0) 20 3003 8632\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.

The Group operates a lean structure with the limited Board and brings in specialist consultants, experts in their field, to support the business as required.\nPipeline\nNuformix has a small pipeline of preclinical assets in development to address the high unmet medical need in fibrosis and oncology. We target solutions using our expertise to develop and file patent applications on novel crystalline forms of existing, marketed drugs, that have improved physical properties, with the aim of developing novel products in new indications to create attractive commercial opportunities. Importantly, the commercial opportunity is optimised when the repurposed product is differentiated from the original marketed product by way of either dose, route of administration or presentation.\nDrug repurposing is a well-known and successful strategy for enhancing the therapeutic and commercial value of marketed drugs. Such development strategies typically offer a greater probability of success compared to developing newly discovered drugs. This is due to the existing data that has been generated on the marketed drug, which can serve as an evidence-base for safety and efficacy in envisaged novel products. This existence of data may also result in lower overall development costs, shorter development timelines and reduced risk in development.\nThe Group's business model is to take its assets through key value inflection points before partnering or licensing its IP. We conduct R&D activities through out-sourcing, to enable access to different types of expertise that are needed for effective R&D and to minimise our operational costs. The Group has a strong network of external contractors, with whom we have had relationships over many years.\nNXP002 (novel proprietary form of tranilast) - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"IPF\")\nNXP002 is the Group's lead asset and a potential novel inhaled treatment for IPF, PPF and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (\"ILD\"). NXP002 is a proprietary, new form of the drug tranilast with enhanced physical properties that allow delivery direct to the lung via nebulisation.\nThere are more than 200 types of ILD, which are characterised by varied amounts of inflammation, scarring, or both, that damage the lung's ability to absorb oxygen. IPF is the most well-known form of ILD, affecting approximately 100,000 patients per year in the US. Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"PPF\"), previously referred to as Progressive Fibrosing ILD (PF-ILD), is a larger and even more poorly served segment of the ILD market, affecting approximately 200,000 patients per year in the US.\nIPF and PPF are devastating lung diseases associated with a higher mortality rate than many cancers with median survival of 3-5 years. Thus, IPF and PPF represent a high unmet medical need such that the requirement for improved treatment options represents what the Directors believe to be a significant commercial opportunity. IPF is classified as a rare disease and presents a global commercial market that is forecast to grow to US$6.45bn by 2031. Sales of standard-of-care (\"SoC\") therapies OFEV and Esbriet (now off patent) achieved US$3.5bn and US$0.8bn respectively in 2022.\nTranilast has a long history of safe use as an oral drug for asthma, keloids and hypertrophic scarring, but while there is growing evidence that supports its potential use in other fibrotic conditions, including IPF, a combination of poor physicochemical properties, variable pharmacokinetics and challenging pharmacodynamics following oral delivery limit its potential use in ILDs. NXP002 is differentiated as it is a patent protected, novel form of tranilast that has been optimised for formulation and delivery direct to the lungs by inhalation, potentially overcoming the issues using tranilast orally as a chronic treatment for fibrosing ILDs.\nNXP002 as a potential treatment for IPF, is a likely candidate for Orphan Drug Designation, which could provide additional product protection and exclusivities against potential future competitors in addition to product development advantages.\nThe inhalation route is a well-known delivery strategy for the treatment of lung diseases to yield greater efficacy and reduce systemic, off-target side-effects compared to oral treatment. Discontinuation of treatment in IPF and PPF patients is currently an issue in the treatment of these diseases ",

We operate a lean structure with the limited Board and bring in specialists and consultants, experts in their field, to support the business as required.\nPipeline\nNuformix has an early-stage pipeline of preclinical assets in development to address the high unmet medical need in fibrosis and oncology. We target solutions using our expertise to develop and file patent applications on novel crystalline forms of existing, marketed drugs, that have improved physical properties, with the aim of developing novel products in new indications to create attractive commercial opportunities. Importantly, the commercial opportunity is optimised when the repurposed product is differentiated from the original marketed drug by way of either dose, route of administration or presentation.\nDrug repurposing is a well-known and successful strategy for enhancing the therapeutic and commercial value of marketed drugs, and their development typically brings a greater probability of success compared to developing newly discovered drugs, due to the existing data that has been generated on the marketed drug. This existence of data may also result in lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines.\nThe Group's business model is to take these assets to key value inflection points before partnering or licensing. We conduct our R&D activities through out-sourcing, to enable us to access the different types of expertise that are needed for drug R&D and to minimise our operational costs. We have a strong network of external contractors, with whom we have had relationships over many years.\nNXP002 (novel proprietary form of tranilast) - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"IPF\")\nNXP002 is the Group's preclinical lead asset and a potential novel inhaled treatment for IPF and possibly other fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (\"ILDs\"). It is a proprietary, new form of the drug tranilast, which allows the drug to be delivered in an inhaled formulation.\nIPF is a devastating lung disease associated with a higher mortality rate than many cancers. Thus, IPF represents a high unmet medical need such that the requirement for improved treatment options represents a significant commercial opportunity. IPF is classified as a rare disease and presents a global commercial market that is forecast to grow to US$8.8bn by 2027. Sales of standard-of-care therapies OFEV and Esbriet (now off patent) achieved US$3.5bn and US$0.8bn respectively in 2022.\nTranilast has a long history of safe use as an oral drug for asthma, keloids and hypertrophic scarring, but there is growing evidence that supports its potential use in other fibrotic conditions, including IPF. NXP002 is differentiated as it is a patent protected new form of tranilast that has been enabled for formulation and delivery direct to the lungs by inhalation, a new route of administration for this drug. The inhalation route is a well-known strategy for treatment of lung diseases to yield greater efficacy and reduce systemic side-effects compared to oral treatment. Discontinuation rates for standard-of-care IPF therapies can be as high as 80% in certain patient groups due to their debilitating systemic side-effects.\nEffective inhalation therapies offer the potential to overcome these limitations of oral therapies. Nuformix owns granted patents protecting new forms of tranilast, in addition to a recently filed patent protecting its use with SoC in IPF, with patent prosecution progressing in major pharmaceutical territories.\nAs a potential treatment for IPF, which is a rare disease, NXP002 is a likely candidate for Orphan Drug Designation, which could provide additional product protection against potential competitors. The positioning of NXP002 as an inhaled treatment for IPF could be either as added to Standards of Care (SoCs) or administered as a monotherapy\nfor patients non-responsive to SoCs and those declining these therapies due to side effects which impact quality of life.\nThe preclinical inhalation strategy,\ninitiated\nby the Company has significantly progressed NXP002 demonstrating:\n\u00b7\nit can be delivered\nin-vivo\nby a range of nebulisers at the optimum particle size for delivery to the deep lung;\n\u00b7\nvery high doses appe",

Nuformix owns two patent applications relating to crystalline forms of tranilast, one of which had already been granted globally. This second patent application, which as has already been granted in the US, specifically addresses the novel tranilast forms being progressed by the Company as a potential novel IPF treatment.\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director of Nuformix, said:\n\"I'm delighted we have received this Official Decision to Grant from the Japanese Patent Office. This provides confirmation that no prior art exists in relation to NXP002, which is very important given that this is the territory in which tranilast was first invented and where the vast majority of considerable subsequent development work has been conducted.

The results indicated:\no\nNXP002 alone delivered a strong, consistent anti-fibrotic effect as demonstrated by modulation of the release of multiple biomarkers of fibrosis; and\no\nBoth high and low concentrations of NXP002 showed an additive anti-fibrotic effect to SoC.\n\u00b7\nThe anti-inflammatory action of NXP002 was subsequently investigated, post period end, in the same model and the results indicated:\no\nNXP002 alone delivered a strong, consistent anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by modulation of the release of multiple biomarkers of inflammation; and\no\nNXP002 increased the performance of SoCs in modulating the release of a panel of inflammation biomarkers associated with the progression of fibrotic lung disease.\n\u00b7\nThe Company additionally successfully\nconducted duration of action studies using an exploratory 3D human lung\ntissue\nmodel offering species relevance and NXP002 dosage control. This allowed investigation of NXP002's\nanti-inflammatory action at various timepoints\nfollowing challenge with lipopolysaccharide (\"LPS\"), a stimulant that induces measurable endpoints and pathways relevant to IPF progression. The results indicated:\no\nNXP002 suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines by healthy human lung tissue following LPS challenge; and\no\nA strong anti-inflammatory effect remains at 12 hours post drug dosing demonstrated by continued suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines following LPS challenge, confirming NXP002 has a suitable duration of action to support its Target Product Profile of twice daily dosing.\n\u00b7\nIn vitro\ndissolution comparisons of NXP004 co-crystals to Lynparza\u00ae (commercially available olaparib)\ndemonstrated that the two lead NXP004 cocrystals selected out-perform Lynparza\n\u00ae\n, in terms of rate and extent of dissolution and release of olaparib.\nFinancial Highlights for the twelve months ended 31 March 2023\n\u00b7\nLoss before tax \u00a3761,299 (31 March 2022: loss of \u00a31,270,273).\n\u00b7\nLoss on ordinary activities (after tax credit) of \u00a3760,136 (31 March 2022: loss of \u00a31,108,994).\n\u00b7\nLoss per share 0.11p (31 March 2022: loss per share 0.19p).\n\u00b7\nNet assets of \u00a34,228,204 (31 March 2022: \u00a34,737,961) including \u00a3259,259 of cash and cash equivalents at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: \u00a3464,095).\n\u00b7\nThe Company's accounting reference date and financial year end\nwas changed\nfrom 31 March to 30 September\n.\n\u00b7\nPost period end, on 13 April 2023, a subscription for 35,000,000 new ordinary shares at a price of 0.20 pence per share raised gross proceeds of\u00a0\u00a370,000. The subscription was undertaken with a single UK-based FCA regulated institutional investor. In addition, the participant in the subscription was issued with one warrant for every one new ordinary share subscribed for with an exercise price of 0.25 pence per warrant. These warrants could result in the issue of an additional 35,000,000 new ordinary shares raising a further \u00a387,500 for progression of the Company's business activities.\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nof Nuformix,\nsaid:\n\"Our interim report demonstrates the Company is continuing to generate value-adding data for its lead programmes whilst further optimising its operational costs. For NXP002, our pre-clinical strategy has delivered consistently positive results that\nallow us to tell a complete pre-clinical story to potential licensing partners for the first time and\ndemonstrate that inhaled treatment of IPF via NXP002 is a viable concept. Our near-term goals focus on our NXP002 programme, as we continue to generate robust data to support our out-licensing objectives, all achievable using existing funds thanks to our lean operational model which will continue to operate. We are greatly encouraged by our recent work in close-to-patient human tissue models, in particular the new data supporting NXP002's duration of action and Target Product Profile. I am excited by our prospects for the remainder of the year as we formally commence partnering activities and look forward to sharing results as they emerge.\"\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nStanford Capital Partners Limited\nTom Price / Patrick Claridge (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3650\nJohn Howes (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) ",

The study results are described below.\nInflammation\nFollowing success in supressing biomarkers of fibrotic disease progression in\nhuman IPF lung tissue\n, the same samples were analysed to assess additional mechanistic and anti-inflammatory benefits on top of SoC's\nand the results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-inflammatory effect as demonstrated by suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines by over 90% for all cytokines studied;\n\u00b7\nBoth high and low concentrations of NXP002 show an additional anti-inflammatory effect in the presence of SoC's and enhance their anti-inflammatory performance;\n\u00b7\nThis effect is most pronounced for MCP-1, which is most closely linked with the progression of IPF\n\u00b7\nThe results further suggests that NXP002 will provide additional efficacy in combination with SoC's, even in patients responding to SoC therapy alone. The data also continues to support the possibility that NXP002 targets additional disease pathways to SoC's, increasing the combined anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory responses.\nOverall, the results strengthen NXP002's potential to increase efficacy of existing therapies with the benefits of inhaled delivery (e.g. added efficacy without increased side effects). They also support NXP002's potential as a monotherapy for patients non-responsive to SoCs and those declining these therapies due to side effects which impact quality of life.\nDuration of Action\nDemonstration of a prolonged duration of action is essential in the development of inhaled therapies, whose clearance from the lung can be rapid. Therapies requiring multiple (more than two) daily uses of inhalation devices for effective treatment are less attractive and suffer reduced patient compliance, even in life-threatening conditions such as IPF. Therefore, Nuformix has developed a Target Product Profile that is consistent with twice daily inhalation administration.\nIn order to assess NXP002's duration of action, the Company initiated work in an exploratory LPS challenge model in healthy human lung tissue, which offers numerous advantages in terms of species relevance and the ability to control tissue exposure to drug. The model also bridges the Company's successful pre-clinical work across a variety of LPS-challenge studies.\nThe results are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 suppresses the release of inflammatory cytokines by healthy human lung tissue following LPS challenge;\n\u00b7\nThis effect is seen at one hour post treatment with NXP002, suggesting only a short time is required for lung tissue penetration and activity;\n\u00b7\nA strong anti-inflammatory effect remains at 12 hours post drug dosing demonstrated by suppression of the release of inflammatory cytokines following LPS challenge, confirming NXP002 has a suitable duration of action; and\n\u00b7\nAn anti-inflammatory effect is still observed at 24 hours post removal of drug.\nNext Steps\nFollowing the success achieved in these studies the Company's next steps include:\n\u00b7\nExpansion of the current studies to include tissue from further human IPF tissue donors to demonstrate the robustness of NXP002's anti-fibrotic response alone and in SoC combinations in multiple patients; and\n\u00b7\nFormally commencing the NXP002 partnering process now that Company has the minimum dataset required to support NXP002's development as an inhaled treatment for IPF, for use alongside SoC's.\nFurther\nupdates will be announced in due course when appropriate\n.\nCommenting, Dr Dan Gooding, Executive Director of Nuformix, said:\n\"I'm absolutely delighted with the data we've generated over recent months - all the results we've achieved are as good as we could have hoped for and are the first results from advanced 'close to patient' IPF and inflammation human tissue disease models. The inflammation data was perhaps expected given past results but provides further support of NXP002's potential to deliver increased performance on top of existing standards of care. However, the positive duration of action data is a first for the NXP002 programme and allows the Company to discharge one of ",

These warrants will be exercisable for two years from Admission (\"Warrants\").\nIf the Warrants were ultimately to be exercised in full, it would result in the issue of an additional 35,000,000 new ordinary shares raising a further \u00a387,500 for progression of the Company's business activities. The New Ordinary Shares and Warrants are being issued pursuant to the Company's existing share issuance authorities.\nThe net proceeds of the Subscription will be used by the Company primarily to further advance its NXP002 programme for the inhaled treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (\"IPF\") in line with the announcement made on 27 March 2023.\nCommenting, Dr Dan Gooding, Executive Director of Nuformix, said:\n\"The funds raised through the Subscription, the first from a new institutional shareholder, will progress NXP002 by undertaking additional key studies that in conjunction with our existing NXP002 data and ongoing studies, will enable the Company to initiate discussions with potential licensees and support the overall progression of the NXP002 programme to improve the treatment of IPF via inhalation. I look forward to providing further updates as we progress.\"\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made for the 35,000,000 New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to the Official List of the FCA and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and that unconditional dealings will commence on the London Stock Exchange at 8.00 a.m. on 21 April 2023.\nFollowing Admission of the New Ordinary Shares and the Fee Shares, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 744,309,368, each with one voting right. The Company does not hold any rights in treasury. The total voting rights figure is therefore 744,309,368 and can be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change of their interest in, the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nStanford Capital Partners Limited\nTom Price / Patrick Claridge (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3650\nJohn Howes / Bob Pountney (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3652\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.

Advancements within this model were designed to significantly reduce output variability. The Company has now received results from these studies\nof NXP002 alone and in combination with current standards of care (\"SoC\"), and they can be summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nNXP002 is well tolerated in ex-vivo human lung tissue with no signs of toxicity events;\n\u00b7\nNXP002 alone delivers a strong, consistent anti-fibrotic effect as demonstrated by modulation of the release of multiple biomarkers of fibrosis;\n\u00b7\nBoth high and low concentrations of NXP002 show an additive anti-fibrotic effect to SoC;\n\u00b7\nIn particular, the higher concentrations of NXP002 with SoC's deliver a near complete ablation of fibrosis biomarker release, yet at lower concentrations than have been seen in other pre-clinical models to date; and\n\u00b7\nThe clear, pronounced additive benefit of NXP002 on top of SoCs observed suggests that NXP002 will provide additional efficacy, even in patients responding to SoC therapy. This raises the possibility that NXP002 targets additional disease pathways to SoC's when increasing the combined anti-fibrotic response.\nOverall, the results provide further support of NXP002's potential to increase efficacy of existing therapies with the benefits of inhaled delivery (e.g. added efficacy without increased side effects). They also support NXP002's potential as a monotherapy for patients declining SoCs - a meaningful proportion of IPF patients who choose against the side effects of SoCs, which impact quality of life.\nFollowing the success achieved in these studies the Company's next steps include:\n\u00b7\nInvestigation of inflammation-related biomarkers in the same tissue sample sets to confirm additional mechanistic and anti-inflammatory benefits on top of SoC's, given the positive anti-fibrotic response;\n\u00b7\nExpansion of the current study to include tissue from an additional two further human IPF tissue donors to demonstrate the robustness of NXP002's anti-fibrotic response alone and in SoC combinations in multiple patients; and\n\u00b7\nTo consider the expansion of the Company's on-going healthy lung tissue study investigating NXP002's duration of action to three donors, based on results when received.\nUnderstanding the performance of new IPF therapies with SoC's has become critical to both potential development partners and regulators. Therefore, the Company believes completion of these steps is required for Nuformix to secure the interest of out-licensing partners.\nResults will continue to be generated with further\nupdates announced when appropriate\n.\nCommenting, Dr Dan Gooding, Executive Director of Nuformix, said:\n\"\nAll parties are delighted with the results from this study, which are as good as we could have hoped for and are the first results from what is the most advanced iteration of this 'close to patient' IPF disease model to date. The reduced variability in the resulting data allows us to have high confidence in both NXP002's anti-fibrotic activity alone, but also in the added anti-fibrotic performance it can deliver on top of existing standards of care. Additivity to standard of care is the most important aspect because it's the simplest option to investigate in a clinical study and is therefore fast becoming a top priority for potential licensing partners. Having seen the quality of these results, our aim now is to generate datasets from three donors in both human IPF and healthy lung duration of action studies. These data can be generated quickly and will be essential in opening up new discussions with potential licensing partners and support overall progression of the NXP002 programme.\"\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nStanford Capital Partners Limited\nTom Price / Patrick Claridge (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3650\nJohn Howes (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3652\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing.

Suitable human disease tissue, which is highly limited in supply, has now been acquired allowing the practical elements of the study to commence,\nwith results and further\nupdates to be announced in due course.\nNXP002 combinations have already shown promise in human diseased IPF tissue, showing a pleasing synergistic efficacy effect with low doses of standards-of-care, resulting in the Group filing a new combination patent application in 2022.\nCommenting, Dr Dan Gooding, Executive Director of Nuformix, said:\n\"\nWe've had to wait a little longer than expected to acquire suitable tissue, but I'm delighted that the main element of this key study, further evaluating NXP002 combination therapies is now underway and I look forward to sharing the results when they are available.\"\nEnquiries:\nNuformix plc\nDr Dan Gooding, Executive Director\nVia IFC Advisory\nStanford Capital Partners Limited\nTom Price / Patrick Claridge (Corporate Finance)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3650\nJohn Howes (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 20 3650 3652\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe\nZach Cohen\n+44 (0) 20 3934 6630\nnuformix@investor-focus.co.uk\nAbout Nuformix\nNuformix is a pharmaceutical development company targeting unmet medical needs in fibrosis and oncology via drug repurposing. The Company aims to use its expertise in discovering, developing and patenting novel drug forms, with improved physical properties, to develop new products in new indications that are, importantly, differentiated from the original (by way of dosage, delivery route or presentation), thus creating new and attractive commercial opportunities. Nuformix has a pipeline of preclinical assets with potential for significant value and early licensing opportunities.\nAbout Fibrosis\nFibrotic disease is typically associated with high patient mortality, increasing prevalence and a lack of safe and effective treatments. Whilst fibrosis treatments are in their infancy the emerging lung fibrosis market demonstrates their blockbuster potential. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is classified as a rare disease and presents a global commercial market that is forecast to grow to US$5bn by 2025. Sales of standard-of-care therapies OFEV and Esbriet achieved US$2.58bn and US$1.04bn respectively in 2021.\nThis information is provided by Reach, the non-regulatory press release distribution service of RNS, part of the London Stock Exchange.

Once Nuformix responded, the file would have been back with the FDA as a complete application again. From that point, the standard FDA target is around 90 days to issue a decision. If the clarification response went in around the same time as the November RNS, then 90 days takes us to around 10 February 2026. We are now already deep into that timeframe. So realistically: \u2022\tThis should already be close to resolution. \u2022\tWe are firmly in the decision window now. \u2022\tIf granted, it can show up on the FDA orphan database before any RNS.

I think I originally invested in NFX in 2018, it was in the days of Sailorboy who used to be called Aim4Utopia who was our most prolifically nasty poster I think! Then there was Amberdeenman that brought a lot of PIs into this and COPL a Canadian dodgy as hell oil \"producer\". FFX seems to be more positive of late which is a nice turn. I see lots of rampy barrow boys trying to push the sentiment up which is hilariously transparent but hey ho why not (RIP Jay). It would be great to finally make some money out of NFX with all the nonsense we have put up with over the last 7-8 years. Out of interest when did you originally invest Soup?",

So this entry means: \u2022\t\u2705 FDA has accepted and designated this drug for IPF \u2022\t\u274c It is not approved yet (still pre-approval like NFX) Is it a competitor? \ud83d\udc49 Broadly yes, but very early and not a blocker. Multiple orphan drugs can target the same disease. Orphan designation does not give exclusivity. Only approval can. For NFX, this is neutral to mildly positive: it confirms IPF is an active orphan focus area and that FDA is granting new designations. Bottom line: Not bad news. Not a rejection.

Once Nuformix responded, the file would have been back with the FDA as a complete application again. From that point, the standard FDA target is around 90 days to issue a decision. If the clarification response went in around the same time as the November RNS, then 90 days takes us to around 10 February 2026. We are now already deep into that timeframe. So realistically: \u2022\tThis should already be close to resolution. \u2022\tWe are firmly in the decision window now. \u2022\tIf granted, it can show up on the FDA orphan database before any RNS. On that basis, I\u2019d personally be surprised if this isn\u2019t resolved within the next couple of weeks, unless there\u2019s been another FDA query we\u2019re not aware of.

So this entry means: \u2022\t\u2705 FDA has accepted and designated this drug for IPF \u2022\t\u274c It is not approved yet (still pre-approval like NFX) Is it a competitor? \ud83d\udc49 Broadly yes, but very early and not a blocker. Multiple orphan drugs can target the same disease. Orphan designation does not give exclusivity. Only approval can. For NFX, this is neutral to mildly positive: it confirms IPF is an active orphan focus area and that FDA is granting new designations. Bottom line: Not bad news. Not a rejection.

The Group operates a lean structure with the limited Board and brings in specialist consultants, experts in their field, to support the business as required.\nPipeline\nNuformix has a small pipeline of preclinical assets in development to address the high unmet medical need in fibrosis and oncology. We target solutions using our expertise to develop and file patent applications on novel crystalline forms of existing, marketed drugs, that have improved physical properties, with the aim of developing novel products in new indications to create attractive commercial opportunities. Importantly, the commercial opportunity is optimised when the repurposed product is differentiated from the original marketed product by way of either dose, route of administration or presentation.\nDrug repurposing is a well-known and successful strategy for enhancing the therapeutic and commercial value of marketed drugs. Such development strategies typically offer a greater probability of success compared to developing newly discovered drugs. This is due to the existing data that has been generated on the marketed drug, which can serve as an evidence-base for safety and efficacy in envisaged novel products. This existence of data may also result in lower overall development costs, shorter development timelines and reduced risk in development.\nThe Group's business model is to take its assets through key value inflection points before partnering or licensing its IP. We conduct research and development (\"R&D\") activities through out-sourcing, to enable access to different types of expertise that are needed for effective R&D and to minimise our operational costs. The Group has a strong network of external contractors, with whom we have had relationships over many years.\nNXP002 (novel proprietary form of tranilast) - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"IPF\")\nNXP002 is the Group's lead asset and a potential novel inhaled treatment for IPF, Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (\"PPF\"), and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (\"ILD\"). NXP002 is a proprietary, new form of the drug tranilast with enhanced physical properties that allow delivery direct to the lung via nebulisation.\nThere are more than 200 types of ILD, which are characterised by varied amounts of inflammation, scarring, or both, that damage the lung's ability to absorb oxygen. IPF is the most well-known form of ILD, affecting approximately 100,000 patients per year in the US. PPF previously referred to as Progressive Fibrosing ILD (PF-ILD), is a larger and even more poorly served segment of the ILD market, affecting approximately 200,000 patients per year in the US.\nIPF and PPF are devastating lung diseases associated with a higher mortality rate than many cancers with median survival of 3-5 years. Thus, IPF and PPF represent a high unmet medical need such that the requirement for improved treatment options represents what the Directors believe to be a significant commercial opportunity. IPF is classified as a rare disease and presents a global commercial market that is forecast to grow to US$6.4bn by 2031. Sales of standard-of-care (\"SoC\") therapy OFEV achieved EUR3.8bn in 2024. Sales of Esbriet, also an IPF SoC therapy peaked\u00a0in 2020 at USD1.2bn prior to genericisation.\nTranilast has a long history of safe use as an oral drug for asthma, keloids and hypertrophic scarring, but while there is growing evidence that supports its potential use in other fibrotic conditions, including IPF, a combination of poor physicochemical properties, variable pharmacokinetics and challenging pharmacodynamics following oral delivery limit its potential use in ILDs. NXP002 is differentiated as it is a patent protected, novel form of tranilast that has been optimised for formulation and delivery direct to the lungs by inhalation, potentially overcoming the issues using tranilast orally as a chronic treatment for fibrosing ILDs.\nThe inhalation route is a well-known delivery strategy for the treatment of lung diseases to yield greater efficacy and reduce systemic, off-target side-effects compared to oral treatment. Discontinuation of treatment in IPF and PPF patients is currently an issue in the treatment of these diseases with discontinuation rates for current SoCs up to 80% in certain patient groups due to, in part, their debilitating systemic side effects. The Directors believe effective inhalation therapies offer the potential to over",

Looking ahead, the company said the main priority for directors is to focus on the firm's NXP002 programme and specifically to find a business development partner.\" So, the Co is spending more, gearing up for the development phase IMO and getting ready for a partner - why do that, if too much uncertainty with the outcome in the USA? it's been more than 10 weeks since the FDA query, does anyone think that - had the FDA been unsatisfied with the response - it would not have rejected the application by now? All IMO.  Co keeps referring to \"partners\", can we reasonably assume that these (more than 1) potential partners are just waiting for the ODD designation before signing an agreement with NFX?  I mean, why commit now and not wait until the ODD?  It doesn't mean though that there are no interested parties; but the number crunching can only begin once the FDA responds, right?",

The share price is basically back in the same zone as the last funding round (Oct 2025), when they did an underwritten open offer at 0.2p raising ~\u00a3228k. If they repeated that same model today, a similar raise would likely look like: \u2022 Issue price around 0.2p \u2022 Raise in the region of \u00a3225k\u2013\u00a3250k \u2022 Around ~120m new shares \u2022 About ~5.5\u20135.7% dilution Which in retail terms would probably be structured almost identically as: \ud83d\udc49 2 new shares for every 35 held So effectively, the market is valuing NFX back at a level where the last capital raise was done. That suggests the current price is still reflecting funding risk / weak-outcome expectations, not any real value for ODD or partnership upside yet. We where all oversubscribed last time and the sp bounced quick enough.",

It reframes NXP002 from \u201ctranilast repurpose\u201d into a multi-pathway disease-modifying fibrosis asset. They explicitly say this work: \u2022 demonstrates translation from cell models \u2192 human disease \u2192 multiple organs \u2022 strengthens its positioning as a platform fibrosis drug, not single-organ This is exactly the kind of language partners look for. \ufffc \u2e3b 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Orphan Drug Designation is now formally embedded in the strategy They confirm: \u2022 EMA Orphan Drug Designation granted (29 May 2025) \u2022 ODD is now a core commercial and defensive pillar \u2022 Explicitly linked to partner attractiveness and competitive protection They also state that the Directors concluded NXP002 was a strong ODD candidate after this new pharmacology review (so the science directly fed into the regulatory strategy). This tightens the narrative around why NXP002 should attract licensing interest. \ufffc \u2e3b 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Partnering is no longer vague \u2013 it\u2019s active and multi-party They explicitly state they are: \u2022 progressing partnering discussions with multiple parties \u2022 working with industry experts and KOLs to shape clinical design, cost, and timelines \u2022 aiming to secure a licensing, option, or collaborative agreement This is stronger than older boilerplate language. It doesn\u2019t name partners, but it formally confirms active BD processes. \ufffc \u2e3b 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The financial position is now very clearly framed as forcing a deal They are unusually blunt: \u2022 cash at year end: \u00a397k \u2022 post-period open offer: \u00a3228k \u2022 explicitly not enough for 12 months \u2022 directors not taking salaries \u2022 \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over going concern \u2022 reliance on partnering or further fundraising This is not new in reality, but it is newly explicit in wording, which often precedes either: \u2022 a deal announcement \u2022 or another emergency raise It increases pressure for news-driven resolution. \ufffc \u2e3b \u2696\ufe0f What has NOT changed \u2022 No named pharma partner \u2022 No clinical trial start \u2022 No FDA Orphan approval yet (only EMA confirmed) \u2022 No timelines given \u2022 No new asset added \u2022 No monetisation of NXP001 beyond legacy royalty rights \u2022 No funding solution secured This is not a catalyst RNS. It is positioning and runway disclosure",

I would prefer the SP to be at least 200% higher than it is at present to maximise the impact when ODD is awarded - which I firmly believe will be imminent - the timing of the RNS is not a coincidence in my opinion !! I am slightly astounded that they are using phrases like - talking to potential partners - surely they should have an agreement waiting to be announced as soon as ODD is awarded ?? That is after all what was intermated within the previous RNS, remember ODD awarded shortly followed by partner announcement. But all in all we PIs will just have to wait it out as per usual.",

So a partner can materially reduce burn, but it does not remove all funding needs. Also worth being clear: ODD on its own does not automatically mean a partner follows. It helps discussions, but it is not a deal. Which raises a fair question if cash runway is the main drag on the share price: Why not fund sooner and remove the overhang, using the same kind of subscription to existing holders (like the 2 for 35 last time)? Yes, the price may be higher after ODD, but if it is a subscription for existing shareholders, what real difference does timing make, other than clearing uncertainty?",

At what should have been the end of the process, last year, the board had to release an RNS to say a query had been raised, something which they didn't have to notify us about for the 'more challenging' EU submission. We have no idea when they submitted the data nor when we can expect a response back. I didn't personally sense any excitement about impending news in the Annual Results. Instead, it felt more solemn,  with focus now on having to raise more money to continue to try and pin down partners, something they have been telling us that they have been doing for nearly 2 years! Most of us thought that these partner discussions should have been in a very advanced state by now. The fact that there are supposed to be 'multiple' partners should have added an element of competition to the situation, in our favour. The last hurdle should have been the FDA decision so that the board could finally choose which partner to go with. Maybe its just more poor communication in the Annual Results RNS that has unnerved investors. Maybe, the board are so optimistic of a positive outcome that they have simply switched focus to raising funds to move forward with the next stage of collaboration, forgetting to reinforce their expectations of a positive outcome for the pending decision. Or, maybe they feel or know something different, preparing for the worst by having to raise funds to try and renegotiate something based on EMA approval alone. I really hope it's not the latter and that the FDA hasn't been another wild goose chase that is about to cast a shadow on the success of the EU approval. The EU approval should have been enough to negotiate a deal on. I don't know what is going to happen but I certainly don't find it hard to understand why we are at .2p instead of being north of .3p",

They have cash for 2 months, so if no FDA news in Febr, funds should be raised in March IMO.

Co burned 600k in 12m i.e. 50k pm so a fund raise would not be more than 150-200k - the only question is when exactly and will a positive FDA decision come prior to that?  So, no fundamentals have changed, we are just 1 day closer to the FDA's decision. Bottom fishers should come back soon IMO.",

Looking ahead, the company said the main priority for directors is to focus on the firm's NXP002 programme and specifically to find a business development partner.\" So, the Co is spending more, gearing up for the development phase IMO and getting ready for a partner - why do that, if too much uncertainty with the outcome in the USA? it's been more than 10 weeks since the FDA query, does anyone think that - had the FDA been unsatisfied with the response - it would not have rejected the application by now? All IMO.  Co keeps referring to \"partners\", can we reasonably assume that these (more than 1) potential partners are just waiting for the ODD designation before signing an agreement with NFX?  I mean, why commit now and not wait until the ODD?  It doesn't mean though that there are no interested parties; but the number crunching can only begin once the FDA responds, right?",

The share price is basically back in the same zone as the last funding round (Oct 2025), when they did an underwritten open offer at 0.2p raising ~\u00a3228k. If they repeated that same model today, a similar raise would likely look like: \u2022 Issue price around 0.2p \u2022 Raise in the region of \u00a3225k\u2013\u00a3250k \u2022 Around ~120m new shares \u2022 About ~5.5\u20135.7% dilution Which in retail terms would probably be structured almost identically as: \ud83d\udc49 2 new shares for every 35 held So effectively, the market is valuing NFX back at a level where the last capital raise was done. That suggests the current price is still reflecting funding risk / weak-outcome expectations, not any real value for ODD or partnership upside yet. We where all oversubscribed last time and the sp bounced quick enough.",

It reframes NXP002 from \u201ctranilast repurpose\u201d into a multi-pathway disease-modifying fibrosis asset. They explicitly say this work: \u2022 demonstrates translation from cell models \u2192 human disease \u2192 multiple organs \u2022 strengthens its positioning as a platform fibrosis drug, not single-organ This is exactly the kind of language partners look for. \ufffc \u2e3b 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Orphan Drug Designation is now formally embedded in the strategy They confirm: \u2022 EMA Orphan Drug Designation granted (29 May 2025) \u2022 ODD is now a core commercial and defensive pillar \u2022 Explicitly linked to partner attractiveness and competitive protection They also state that the Directors concluded NXP002 was a strong ODD candidate after this new pharmacology review (so the science directly fed into the regulatory strategy). This tightens the narrative around why NXP002 should attract licensing interest. \ufffc \u2e3b 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Partnering is no longer vague \u2013 it\u2019s active and multi-party They explicitly state they are: \u2022 progressing partnering discussions with multiple parties \u2022 working with industry experts and KOLs to shape clinical design, cost, and timelines \u2022 aiming to secure a licensing, option, or collaborative agreement This is stronger than older boilerplate language. It doesn\u2019t name partners, but it formally confirms active BD processes. \ufffc \u2e3b 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The financial position is now very clearly framed as forcing a deal They are unusually blunt: \u2022 cash at year end: \u00a397k \u2022 post-period open offer: \u00a3228k \u2022 explicitly not enough for 12 months \u2022 directors not taking salaries \u2022 \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over going concern \u2022 reliance on partnering or further fundraising This is not new in reality, but it is newly explicit in wording, which often precedes either: \u2022 a deal announcement \u2022 or another emergency raise It increases pressure for news-driven resolution. \ufffc \u2e3b \u2696\ufe0f What has NOT changed \u2022 No named pharma partner \u2022 No clinical trial start \u2022 No FDA Orphan approval yet (only EMA confirmed) \u2022 No timelines given \u2022 No new asset added \u2022 No monetisation of NXP001 beyond legacy royalty rights \u2022 No funding solution secured This is not a catalyst RNS.

I am slightly astounded that they are using phrases like - talking to potential partners - surely they should have an agreement waiting to be announced as soon as ODD is awarded ?? That is after all what was intermated within the previous RNS, remember ODD awarded shortly followed by partner announcement. But all in all we PIs will just have to wait it out as per usual.",

It\u2019s one underlying trade being reported twice (aggressive side + reporting side), often when MMs transfer or rebalance stock between books. The repeated 500k blocks at 0.22 are typical of a large line being chopped and crossed internally. This does not indicate accumulation or new demand and it does not clear the overhang. The only meaningful flow on the tape is where you see a clean aggressive print (e.g. the ~2.08m Buy* at 0.239). Everything else in that cluster is just market plumbing noise.",

It reads very positive across the spectrum and the results demonstrating clear clinical improvement.",

So a partner can materially reduce burn, but it does not remove all funding needs. Also worth being clear: ODD on its own does not automatically mean a partner follows. It helps discussions, but it is not a deal. Which raises a fair question if cash runway is the main drag on the share price: Why not fund sooner and remove the overhang, using the same kind of subscription to existing holders (like the 2 for 35 last time)? Yes, the price may be higher after ODD, but if it is a subscription for existing shareholders, what real difference does timing make, other than clearing uncertainty?",

At what should have been the end of the process, last year, the board had to release an RNS to say a query had been raised, something which they didn't have to notify us about for the 'more challenging' EU submission. We have no idea when they submitted the data nor when we can expect a response back. I didn't personally sense any excitement about impending news in the Annual Results. Instead, it felt more solemn,  with focus now on having to raise more money to continue to try and pin down partners, something they have been telling us that they have been doing for nearly 2 years! Most of us thought that these partner discussions should have been in a very advanced state by now. The fact that there are supposed to be 'multiple' partners should have added an element of competition to the situation, in our favour. The last hurdle should have been the FDA decision so that the board could finally choose which partner to go with. Maybe its just more poor communication in the Annual Results RNS that has unnerved investors. Maybe, the board are so optimistic of a positive outcome that they have simply switched focus to raising funds to move forward with the next stage of collaboration, forgetting to reinforce their expectations of a positive outcome for the pending decision. Or, maybe they feel or know something different, preparing for the worst by having to raise funds to try and renegotiate something based on EMA approval alone. I really hope it's not the latter and that the FDA hasn't been another wild goose chase that is about to cast a shadow on the success of the EU approval. The EU approval should have been enough to negotiate a deal on. I don't know what is going to happen but I certainly don't find it hard to understand why we are at .2p instead of being north of .3p",

They have cash for 2 months, so if no FDA news in Febr, funds should be raised in March IMO.

Co burned 600k in 12m i.e. 50k pm so a fund raise would not be more than 150-200k - the only question is when exactly and will a positive FDA decision come prior to that?  So, no fundamentals have changed, we are just 1 day closer to the FDA's decision. Bottom fishers should come back soon IMO.",

Looking ahead, the company said the main priority for directors is to focus on the firm's NXP002 programme and specifically to find a business development partner.\" So, the Co is spending more, gearing up for the development phase IMO and getting ready for a partner - why do that, if too much uncertainty with the outcome in the USA? it's been more than 10 weeks since the FDA query, does anyone think that - had the FDA been unsatisfied with the response - it would not have rejected the application by now? All IMO.  Co keeps referring to \"partners\", can we reasonably assume that these (more than 1) potential partners are just waiting for the ODD designation before signing an agreement with NFX?  I mean, why commit now and not wait until the ODD?  It doesn't mean though that there are no interested parties; but the number crunching can only begin once the FDA responds, right?",

The share price is basically back in the same zone as the last funding round (Oct 2025), when they did an underwritten open offer at 0.2p raising ~\u00a3228k. If they repeated that same model today, a similar raise would likely look like: \u2022 Issue price around 0.2p \u2022 Raise in the region of \u00a3225k\u2013\u00a3250k \u2022 Around ~120m new shares \u2022 About ~5.5\u20135.7% dilution Which in retail terms would probably be structured almost identically as: \ud83d\udc49 2 new shares for every 35 held So effectively, the market is valuing NFX back at a level where the last capital raise was done. That suggests the current price is still reflecting funding risk / weak-outcome expectations, not any real value for ODD or partnership upside yet. We where all oversubscribed last time and the sp bounced quick enough.",

          "content": "AI summary \u2705 What is genuinely NEW or noteworthy 1\ufe0f\u20e3 New scientific positioning of NXP002 (important for partners) They disclose a new in-depth pharmacology review using AI and human biology mapping, showing NXP002 regulates four core fibrotic pathways, including: \u2022 TGF-\u03b2 (core fibrosis driver) \u2022 WNT/\u03b2-catenin \u2022 NLRP3 inflammasome \u2022 extracellular matrix deposition pathways This is new colour and quite important. It reframes NXP002 from \u201ctranilast repurpose\u201d into a multi-pathway disease-modifying fibrosis asset. They explicitly say this work: \u2022 demonstrates translation from cell models \u2192 human disease \u2192 multiple organs \u2022 strengthens its positioning as a platform fibrosis drug, not single-organ This is exactly the kind of language partners look for. \ufffc \u2e3b 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Orphan Drug Designation is now formally embedded in the strategy They confirm: \u2022 EMA Orphan Drug Designation granted (29 May 2025) \u2022 ODD is now a core commercial and defensive pillar \u2022 Explicitly linked to partner attractiveness and competitive protection They also state that the Directors concluded NXP002 was a strong ODD candidate after this new pharmacology review (so the science directly fed into the regulatory strategy). This tightens the narrative around why NXP002 should attract licensing interest. \ufffc \u2e3b 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Partnering is no longer vague \u2013 it\u2019s active and multi-party They explicitly state they are: \u2022 progressing partnering discussions with multiple parties \u2022 working with industry experts and KOLs to shape clinical design, cost, and timelines \u2022 aiming to secure a licensing, option, or collaborative agreement This is stronger than older boilerplate language. It doesn\u2019t name partners, but it formally confirms active BD processes. \ufffc \u2e3b 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The financial position is now very clearly framed as forcing a deal They are unusually blunt: \u2022 cash at year end: \u00a397k \u2022 post-period open offer: \u00a3228k \u2022 explicitly not enough for 12 months \u2022 directors not taking salaries \u2022 \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over going concern \u2022 reliance on partnering or further fundraising This is not new in reality, but it is newly explicit in wording, which often precedes either: \u2022 a deal announcement \u2022 or another emergency raise It increases pressure for news-driven resolution. \ufffc \u2e3b \u2696\ufe0f What has NOT changed \u2022 No named pharma partner \u2022 No clinical trial start \u2022 No FDA Orphan approval yet (only EMA confirmed) \u2022 No timelines given \u2022 No new asset added \u2022 No monetisation of NXP001 beyond legacy royalty rights \u2022 No funding solution secured This is not a catalyst RNS. It is positioning and runway disclosure",

I am slightly astounded that they are using phrases like - talking to potential partners - surely they should have an agreement waiting to be announced as soon as ODD is awarded ?? That is after all what was intermated within the previous RNS, remember ODD awarded shortly followed by partner announcement. But all in all we PIs will just have to wait it out as per usual.",

The repeated 500k blocks at 0.22 are typical of a large line being chopped and crossed internally. This does not indicate accumulation or new demand and it does not clear the overhang. The only meaningful flow on the tape is where you see a clean aggressive print (e.g. the ~2.08m Buy* at 0.239). Everything else in that cluster is just market plumbing noise.",

At what should have been the end of the process, last year, the board had to release an RNS to say a query had been raised, something which they didn't have to notify us about for the 'more challenging' EU submission. We have no idea when they submitted the data nor when we can expect a response back. I didn't personally sense any excitement about impending news in the Annual Results. Instead, it felt more solemn,  with focus now on having to raise more money to continue to try and pin down partners, something they have been telling us that they have been doing for nearly 2 years! Most of us thought that these partner discussions should have been in a very advanced state by now. The fact that there are supposed to be 'multiple' partners should have added an element of competition to the situation, in our favour. The last hurdle should have been the FDA decision so that the board could finally choose which partner to go with. Maybe its just more poor communication in the Annual Results RNS that has unnerved investors. Maybe, the board are so optimistic of a positive outcome that they have simply switched focus to raising funds to move forward with the next stage of collaboration, forgetting to reinforce their expectations of a positive outcome for the pending decision. Or, maybe they feel or know something different, preparing for the worst by having to raise funds to try and renegotiate something based on EMA approval alone. I really hope it's not the latter and that the FDA hasn't been another wild goose chase that is about to cast a shadow on the success of the EU approval. The EU approval should have been enough to negotiate a deal on. I don't know what is going to happen but I certainly don't find it hard to understand why we are at .2p instead of being north of .3p",

Meanwhile, Nuformix posted no impairment of goodwill for financial 2025, compared to GBP3.6 million in financial 2024.  Looking ahead, the company said the main priority for directors is to focus on the firm's NXP002 programme and specifically to find a business development partner.\" So, the Co is spending more, gearing up for the development phase IMO and getting ready for a partner - why do that, if too much uncertainty with the outcome in the USA? it's been more than 10 weeks since the FDA query, does anyone think that - had the FDA been unsatisfied with the response - it would not have rejected the application by now? All IMO.  Co keeps referring to \"partners\", can we reasonably assume that these (more than 1) potential partners are just waiting for the ODD designation before signing an agreement with NFX?  I mean, why commit now and not wait until the ODD?  It doesn't mean though that there are no interested parties; but the number crunching can only begin once the FDA responds, right?",

The share price is basically back in the same zone as the last funding round (Oct 2025), when they did an underwritten open offer at 0.2p raising ~\u00a3228k. If they repeated that same model today, a similar raise would likely look like: \u2022 Issue price around 0.2p \u2022 Raise in the region of \u00a3225k\u2013\u00a3250k \u2022 Around ~120m new shares \u2022 About ~5.5\u20135.7% dilution Which in retail terms would probably be structured almost identically as: \ud83d\udc49 2 new shares for every 35 held So effectively, the market is valuing NFX back at a level where the last capital raise was done. That suggests the current price is still reflecting funding risk / weak-outcome expectations, not any real value for ODD or partnership upside yet. We where all oversubscribed last time and the sp bounced quick enough.",

It reframes NXP002 from \u201ctranilast repurpose\u201d into a multi-pathway disease-modifying fibrosis asset. They explicitly say this work: \u2022 demonstrates translation from cell models \u2192 human disease \u2192 multiple organs \u2022 strengthens its positioning as a platform fibrosis drug, not single-organ This is exactly the kind of language partners look for. \ufffc \u2e3b 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Orphan Drug Designation is now formally embedded in the strategy They confirm: \u2022 EMA Orphan Drug Designation granted (29 May 2025) \u2022 ODD is now a core commercial and defensive pillar \u2022 Explicitly linked to partner attractiveness and competitive protection They also state that the Directors concluded NXP002 was a strong ODD candidate after this new pharmacology review (so the science directly fed into the regulatory strategy). This tightens the narrative around why NXP002 should attract licensing interest. \ufffc \u2e3b 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Partnering is no longer vague \u2013 it\u2019s active and multi-party They explicitly state they are: \u2022 progressing partnering discussions with multiple parties \u2022 working with industry experts and KOLs to shape clinical design, cost, and timelines \u2022 aiming to secure a licensing, option, or collaborative agreement This is stronger than older boilerplate language. It doesn\u2019t name partners, but it formally confirms active BD processes. \ufffc \u2e3b 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The financial position is now very clearly framed as forcing a deal They are unusually blunt: \u2022 cash at year end: \u00a397k \u2022 post-period open offer: \u00a3228k \u2022 explicitly not enough for 12 months \u2022 directors not taking salaries \u2022 \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over going concern \u2022 reliance on partnering or further fundraising This is not new in reality, but it is newly explicit in wording, which often precedes either: \u2022 a deal announcement \u2022 or another emergency raise It increases pressure for news-driven resolution. \ufffc \u2e3b \u2696\ufe0f What has NOT changed \u2022 No named pharma partner \u2022 No clinical trial start \u2022 No FDA Orphan approval yet (only EMA confirmed) \u2022 No timelines given \u2022 No new asset added \u2022 No monetisation of NXP001 beyond legacy royalty rights \u2022 No funding solution secured This is not a catalyst RNS. It is positioning and runway disclosure",

I am slightly astounded that they are using phrases like - talking to potential partners - surely they should have an agreement waiting to be announced as soon as ODD is awarded ?? That is after all what was intermated within the previous RNS, remember ODD awarded shortly followed by partner announcement. But all in all we PIs will just have to wait it out as per usual.",

That also puts to bed the theory that partners would only be announced or come onboard after the FDA approval: \"The granting of ODD in the US will be helpful to any potential partner, but it is not a prerequisite and discussions continue\" - so if they have got a partner for NXP002 then they can freely talk about it. Nothing stopping a company saying \"If you get the FDA then yes we would partner\" and in fact that could have strengthened the FDA application if (big if) there was something like having to prove the route to market but I doubt the FDA would be interested in that. The point I am trying to make is that if there are any partners the companys can freely talk about that. I make the point because some people have a narrative that we are waiting on FDA approval then all of sudden the partners will be revealed. There is no such need of a timeline like that and if there are partners they can be announced now. As of now there has been no such  announcement. So no partners.",

They got EMA ODD in May last year with whatever benefits that offers. They could have used it to strike a partnership deal. We are now in February, just 3 months away from that anniversary, at which point we will probably have lost a year of those benefits. Despite having the opportunity to use the EMA to strike a deal, they have instead opted to go high risk by putting all their eggs in one basket hingeing on FDA approval. This is now going to cost shareholders further dilution with no reinforced evidence that it will result in a partnership deal. If it fails then it will look bad and not help partnership discussions beyond what we had a year ago. I hope for all our sakes it turns out to have been worth it. Personally, I would much rather be in a position where we are closer to striking a realistic partnership deal on the back of EMA than chasing shadows like we appear to be doing now. All we seem to have done so far is bought more time for our competitors and any vultures out there waiting to take everything off us for nothing.",

At that date the company said they would respond to the FDA 'as soon as possible'. Around the 18th December, both yourself and another posted feedback from Tim at IR saying the response had been submitted. So we know they submitted at some point in that month inbetween the RNS and the investor relations email. It could have been a few days after the RNS or it could have been early to mid-December, we don't know. With the 90 days chat, my understanding is that this relates only to the initial submission. The FDA gave their response after 90 days, which was a request for info. As far as I'm aware, there is no timeline for the FDA to deal with responses to clarification requests. Whereas if the request was made within the initial 90 day period then the clock would stop and restart after receipt of response. As the last RNS for annual results states, the company has had no feedback on timelines from the FDA. So it could land anytime now, or take a few months more. We simply do not know.",

It\u2019s one underlying trade being reported twice (aggressive side + reporting side), often when MMs transfer or rebalance stock between books. The repeated 500k blocks at 0.22 are typical of a large line being chopped and crossed internally. This does not indicate accumulation or new demand and it does not clear the overhang. The only meaningful flow on the tape is where you see a clean aggressive print (e.g. the ~2.08m Buy* at 0.239). Everything else in that cluster is just market plumbing noise.",

So a partner can materially reduce burn, but it does not remove all funding needs. Also worth being clear: ODD on its own does not automatically mean a partner follows. It helps discussions, but it is not a deal. Which raises a fair question if cash runway is the main drag on the share price: Why not fund sooner and remove the overhang, using the same kind of subscription to existing holders (like the 2 for 35 last time)? Yes, the price may be higher after ODD, but if it is a subscription for existing shareholders, what real difference does timing make, other than clearing uncertainty?",

At what should have been the end of the process, last year, the board had to release an RNS to say a query had been raised, something which they didn't have to notify us about for the 'more challenging' EU submission. We have no idea when they submitted the data nor when we can expect a response back. I didn't personally sense any excitement about impending news in the Annual Results. Instead, it felt more solemn,  with focus now on having to raise more money to continue to try and pin down partners, something they have been telling us that they have been doing for nearly 2 years! Most of us thought that these partner discussions should have been in a very advanced state by now. The fact that there are supposed to be 'multiple' partners should have added an element of competition to the situation, in our favour. The last hurdle should have been the FDA decision so that the board could finally choose which partner to go with. Maybe its just more poor communication in the Annual Results RNS that has unnerved investors. Maybe, the board are so optimistic of a positive outcome that they have simply switched focus to raising funds to move forward with the next stage of collaboration, forgetting to reinforce their expectations of a positive outcome for the pending decision. Or, maybe they feel or know something different, preparing for the worst by having to raise funds to try and renegotiate something based on EMA approval alone. I really hope it's not the latter and that the FDA hasn't been another wild goose chase that is about to cast a shadow on the success of the EU approval. The EU approval should have been enough to negotiate a deal on. I don't know what is going to happen but I certainly don't find it hard to understand why we are at .2p instead of being north of .3p",

Looking ahead, the company said the main priority for directors is to focus on the firm's NXP002 programme and specifically to find a business development partner.\" So, the Co is spending more, gearing up for the development phase IMO and getting ready for a partner - why do that, if too much uncertainty with the outcome in the USA? it's been more than 10 weeks since the FDA query, does anyone think that - had the FDA been unsatisfied with the response - it would not have rejected the application by now? All IMO.  Co keeps referring to \"partners\", can we reasonably assume that these (more than 1) potential partners are just waiting for the ODD designation before signing an agreement with NFX?  I mean, why commit now and not wait until the ODD?  It doesn't mean though that there are no interested parties; but the number crunching can only begin once the FDA responds, right?",

The share price is basically back in the same zone as the last funding round (Oct 2025), when they did an underwritten open offer at 0.2p raising ~\u00a3228k. If they repeated that same model today, a similar raise would likely look like: \u2022 Issue price around 0.2p \u2022 Raise in the region of \u00a3225k\u2013\u00a3250k \u2022 Around ~120m new shares \u2022 About ~5.5\u20135.7% dilution Which in retail terms would probably be structured almost identically as: \ud83d\udc49 2 new shares for every 35 held So effectively, the market is valuing NFX back at a level where the last capital raise was done. That suggests the current price is still reflecting funding risk / weak-outcome expectations, not any real value for ODD or partnership upside yet. We where all oversubscribed last time and the sp bounced quick enough.",

It reframes NXP002 from \u201ctranilast repurpose\u201d into a multi-pathway disease-modifying fibrosis asset. They explicitly say this work: \u2022 demonstrates translation from cell models \u2192 human disease \u2192 multiple organs \u2022 strengthens its positioning as a platform fibrosis drug, not single-organ This is exactly the kind of language partners look for. \ufffc \u2e3b 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Orphan Drug Designation is now formally embedded in the strategy They confirm: \u2022 EMA Orphan Drug Designation granted (29 May 2025) \u2022 ODD is now a core commercial and defensive pillar \u2022 Explicitly linked to partner attractiveness and competitive protection They also state that the Directors concluded NXP002 was a strong ODD candidate after this new pharmacology review (so the science directly fed into the regulatory strategy). This tightens the narrative around why NXP002 should attract licensing interest. \ufffc \u2e3b 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Partnering is no longer vague \u2013 it\u2019s active and multi-party They explicitly state they are: \u2022 progressing partnering discussions with multiple parties \u2022 working with industry experts and KOLs to shape clinical design, cost, and timelines \u2022 aiming to secure a licensing, option, or collaborative agreement This is stronger than older boilerplate language. It doesn\u2019t name partners, but it formally confirms active BD processes. \ufffc \u2e3b 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The financial position is now very clearly framed as forcing a deal They are unusually blunt: \u2022 cash at year end: \u00a397k \u2022 post-period open offer: \u00a3228k \u2022 explicitly not enough for 12 months \u2022 directors not taking salaries \u2022 \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over going concern \u2022 reliance on partnering or further fundraising This is not new in reality, but it is newly explicit in wording, which often precedes either: \u2022 a deal announcement \u2022 or another emergency raise It increases pressure for news-driven resolution. \ufffc \u2e3b \u2696\ufe0f What has NOT changed \u2022 No named pharma partner \u2022 No clinical trial start \u2022 No FDA Orphan approval yet (only EMA confirmed) \u2022 No timelines given \u2022 No new asset added \u2022 No monetisation of NXP001 beyond legacy royalty rights \u2022 No funding solution secured This is not a catalyst RNS. It is positioning and runway disclosure",

I would prefer the SP to be at least 200% higher than it is at present to maximise the impact when ODD is awarded - which I firmly believe will be imminent - the timing of the RNS is not a coincidence in my opinion !! I am slightly astounded that they are using phrases like - talking to potential partners - surely they should have an agreement waiting to be announced as soon as ODD is awarded ?? That is after all what was intermated within the previous RNS, remember ODD awarded shortly followed by partner announcement. But all in all we PIs will just have to wait it out as per usual.",

However, there has been no further feedback from the FDA and until a response is received there can be no guarantees. As soon as a response is received a further announcement will be made.

That also puts to bed the theory that partners would only be announced or come onboard after the FDA approval: \"The granting of ODD in the US will be helpful to any potential partner, but it is not a prerequisite and discussions continue\" - so if they have got a partner for NXP002 then they can freely talk about it. Nothing stopping a company saying \"If you get the FDA then yes we would partner\" and in fact that could have strengthened the FDA application if (big if) there was something like having to prove the route to market but I doubt the FDA would be interested in that. The point I am trying to make is that if there are any partners the companys can freely talk about that. I make the point because some people have a narrative that we are waiting on FDA approval then all of sudden the partners will be revealed. There is no such need of a timeline like that and if there are partners they can be announced now. As of now there has been no such  announcement. So no partners.",

They got EMA ODD in May last year with whatever benefits that offers. They could have used it to strike a partnership deal. We are now in February, just 3 months away from that anniversary, at which point we will probably have lost a year of those benefits. Despite having the opportunity to use the EMA to strike a deal, they have instead opted to go high risk by putting all their eggs in one basket hingeing on FDA approval. This is now going to cost shareholders further dilution with no reinforced evidence that it will result in a partnership deal. If it fails then it will look bad and not help partnership discussions beyond what we had a year ago. I hope for all our sakes it turns out to have been worth it. Personally, I would much rather be in a position where we are closer to striking a realistic partnership deal on the back of EMA than chasing shadows like we appear to be doing now. All we seem to have done so far is bought more time for our competitors and any vultures out there waiting to take everything off us for nothing.",

At that date the company said they would respond to the FDA 'as soon as possible'. Around the 18th December, both yourself and another posted feedback from Tim at IR saying the response had been submitted. So we know they submitted at some point in that month inbetween the RNS and the investor relations email. It could have been a few days after the RNS or it could have been early to mid-December, we don't know. With the 90 days chat, my understanding is that this relates only to the initial submission. The FDA gave their response after 90 days, which was a request for info. As far as I'm aware, there is no timeline for the FDA to deal with responses to clarification requests. Whereas if the request was made within the initial 90 day period then the clock would stop and restart after receipt of response. As the last RNS for annual results states, the company has had no feedback on timelines from the FDA. So it could land anytime now, or take a few months more. We simply do not know.",

That also puts to bed the theory that partners would only be announced or come onboard after the FDA approval: \"The granting of ODD in the US will be helpful to any potential partner, but it is not a prerequisite and discussions continue\" - so if they have got a partner for NXP002 then they can freely talk about it. Nothing stopping a company saying \"If you get the FDA then yes we would partner\" and in fact that could have strengthened the FDA application if (big if) there was something like having to prove the route to market but I doubt the FDA would be interested in that. The point I am trying to make is that if there are any partners the companys can freely talk about that. I make the point because some people have a narrative that we are waiting on FDA approval then all of sudden the partners will be revealed. There is no such need of a timeline like that and if there are partners they can be announced now. As of now there has been no such  announcement. So no partners.",

They got EMA ODD in May last year with whatever benefits that offers. They could have used it to strike a partnership deal. We are now in February, just 3 months away from that anniversary, at which point we will probably have lost a year of those benefits. Despite having the opportunity to use the EMA to strike a deal, they have instead opted to go high risk by putting all their eggs in one basket hingeing on FDA approval. This is now going to cost shareholders further dilution with no reinforced evidence that it will result in a partnership deal. If it fails then it will look bad and not help partnership discussions beyond what we had a year ago. I hope for all our sakes it turns out to have been worth it. Personally, I would much rather be in a position where we are closer to striking a realistic partnership deal on the back of EMA than chasing shadows like we appear to be doing now. All we seem to have done so far is bought more time for our competitors and any vultures out there waiting to take everything off us for nothing.",

At that date the company said they would respond to the FDA 'as soon as possible'. Around the 18th December, both yourself and another posted feedback from Tim at IR saying the response had been submitted. So we know they submitted at some point in that month inbetween the RNS and the investor relations email. It could have been a few days after the RNS or it could have been early to mid-December, we don't know. With the 90 days chat, my understanding is that this relates only to the initial submission. The FDA gave their response after 90 days, which was a request for info. As far as I'm aware, there is no timeline for the FDA to deal with responses to clarification requests. Whereas if the request was made within the initial 90 day period then the clock would stop and restart after receipt of response. As the last RNS for annual results states, the company has had no feedback on timelines from the FDA. So it could land anytime now, or take a few months more. We simply do not know.",

The repeated 500k blocks at 0.22 are typical of a large line being chopped and crossed internally. This does not indicate accumulation or new demand and it does not clear the overhang. The only meaningful flow on the tape is where you see a clean aggressive print (e.g. the ~2.08m Buy* at 0.239). Everything else in that cluster is just market plumbing noise.",

Repurposing the oral drug to inhaled backed with evidenced based statistical improvements in biomarkers for pulmonary fibrosis makes it  an attractive asset for pharma to take forward and commercialize. Furthermore they can also see it being used in other forms of fibrosis such as secondary to autoimmune rheumatological pathologies. I like the scope on offer and the trial data that has been recieved according to the historical RNSs. It reads very positive across the spectrum and the results demonstrating clear clinical improvement.",

So a partner can materially reduce burn, but it does not remove all funding needs. Also worth being clear: ODD on its own does not automatically mean a partner follows. It helps discussions, but it is not a deal. Which raises a fair question if cash runway is the main drag on the share price: Why not fund sooner and remove the overhang, using the same kind of subscription to existing holders (like the 2 for 35 last time)? Yes, the price may be higher after ODD, but if it is a subscription for existing shareholders, what real difference does timing make, other than clearing uncertainty?",

          "content": "\"It's harden to pin down why investors have been so cowardly\" Is it that hard to understand? We are now almost 6 months into an FDA review that should only have taken 3. At what should have been the end of the process, last year, the board had to release an RNS to say a query had been raised, something which they didn't have to notify us about for the 'more challenging' EU submission. We have no idea when they submitted the data nor when we can expect a response back. I didn't personally sense any excitement about impending news in the Annual Results. Instead, it felt more solemn,  with focus now on having to raise more money to continue to try and pin down partners, something they have been telling us that they have been doing for nearly 2 years! Most of us thought that these partner discussions should have been in a very advanced state by now. The fact that there are supposed to be 'multiple' partners should have added an element of competition to the situation, in our favour. The last hurdle should have been the FDA decision so that the board could finally choose which partner to go with. Maybe its just more poor communication in the Annual Results RNS that has unnerved investors. Maybe, the board are so optimistic of a positive outcome that they have simply switched focus to raising funds to move forward with the next stage of collaboration, forgetting to reinforce their expectations of a positive outcome for the pending decision. Or, maybe they feel or know something different, preparing for the worst by having to raise funds to try and renegotiate something based on EMA approval alone. I really hope it's not the latter and that the FDA hasn't been another wild goose chase that is about to cast a shadow on the success of the EU approval. The EU approval should have been enough to negotiate a deal on. I don't know what is going to happen but I certainly don't find it hard to understand why we are at .2p instead of being north of .3p",

They have cash for 2 months, so if no FDA news in Febr, funds should be raised in March IMO.

Looking ahead, the company said the main priority for directors is to focus on the firm's NXP002 programme and specifically to find a business development partner.\" So, the Co is spending more, gearing up for the development phase IMO and getting ready for a partner - why do that, if too much uncertainty with the outcome in the USA? it's been more than 10 weeks since the FDA query, does anyone think that - had the FDA been unsatisfied with the response - it would not have rejected the application by now? All IMO.  Co keeps referring to \"partners\", can we reasonably assume that these (more than 1) potential partners are just waiting for the ODD designation before signing an agreement with NFX?  I mean, why commit now and not wait until the ODD?  It doesn't mean though that there are no interested parties; but the number crunching can only begin once the FDA responds, right?",

The share price is basically back in the same zone as the last funding round (Oct 2025), when they did an underwritten open offer at 0.2p raising ~\u00a3228k. If they repeated that same model today, a similar raise would likely look like: \u2022 Issue price around 0.2p \u2022 Raise in the region of \u00a3225k\u2013\u00a3250k \u2022 Around ~120m new shares \u2022 About ~5.5\u20135.7% dilution Which in retail terms would probably be structured almost identically as: \ud83d\udc49 2 new shares for every 35 held So effectively, the market is valuing NFX back at a level where the last capital raise was done. That suggests the current price is still reflecting funding risk / weak-outcome expectations, not any real value for ODD or partnership upside yet. We where all oversubscribed last time and the sp bounced quick enough.",

It reframes NXP002 from \u201ctranilast repurpose\u201d into a multi-pathway disease-modifying fibrosis asset. They explicitly say this work: \u2022 demonstrates translation from cell models \u2192 human disease \u2192 multiple organs \u2022 strengthens its positioning as a platform fibrosis drug, not single-organ This is exactly the kind of language partners look for. \ufffc \u2e3b 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Orphan Drug Designation is now formally embedded in the strategy They confirm: \u2022 EMA Orphan Drug Designation granted (29 May 2025) \u2022 ODD is now a core commercial and defensive pillar \u2022 Explicitly linked to partner attractiveness and competitive protection They also state that the Directors concluded NXP002 was a strong ODD candidate after this new pharmacology review (so the science directly fed into the regulatory strategy). This tightens the narrative around why NXP002 should attract licensing interest. \ufffc \u2e3b 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Partnering is no longer vague \u2013 it\u2019s active and multi-party They explicitly state they are: \u2022 progressing partnering discussions with multiple parties \u2022 working with industry experts and KOLs to shape clinical design, cost, and timelines \u2022 aiming to secure a licensing, option, or collaborative agreement This is stronger than older boilerplate language. It doesn\u2019t name partners, but it formally confirms active BD processes. \ufffc \u2e3b 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The financial position is now very clearly framed as forcing a deal They are unusually blunt: \u2022 cash at year end: \u00a397k \u2022 post-period open offer: \u00a3228k \u2022 explicitly not enough for 12 months \u2022 directors not taking salaries \u2022 \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over going concern \u2022 reliance on partnering or further fundraising This is not new in reality, but it is newly explicit in wording, which often precedes either: \u2022 a deal announcement \u2022 or another emergency raise It increases pressure for news-driven resolution. \ufffc \u2e3b \u2696\ufe0f What has NOT changed \u2022 No named pharma partner \u2022 No clinical trial start \u2022 No FDA Orphan approval yet (only EMA confirmed) \u2022 No timelines given \u2022 No new asset added \u2022 No monetisation of NXP001 beyond legacy royalty rights \u2022 No funding solution secured This is not a catalyst RNS. It is positioning and runway disclosure",

I am slightly astounded that they are using phrases like - talking to potential partners - surely they should have an agreement waiting to be announced as soon as ODD is awarded ?? That is after all what was intermated within the previous RNS, remember ODD awarded shortly followed by partner announcement. But all in all we PIs will just have to wait it out as per usual.",
