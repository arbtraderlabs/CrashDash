Share Placing\nPR Newswire\nLondon, September 7\nTHE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS DEEMED BY IMC TO CONSTITUTE INSIDE INFORMATION AS STIPULATED UNDER THE MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (EU) NO. 596/2014, AS AMENDED (\"MAR\"). ON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nVIA\nA REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE (\"RIS\"), THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nIMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nPlacing of Shares\nPlacing of New and Treasury Shares\nThe Board of IMC is pleased to announce that the Company has raised \u00a3267,500 (two hundred and sixty-seven thousand\nfive hundred pounds Sterling\n) before expenses by way of an oversubscribed placing (the \u201cPlacing\u201d) of 26,750,000 (twenty six million seven hundred and fifty thousand) new ordinary shares of \u20ac0.001 each (\"Shares\") in the Company at a price of 1p per Share (one penny Sterling) for cash (the \u201cPlacing Shares\u201d), conditional only upon admission of the new Placing Shares to the Official List of the FCA and to trading on the regulated market of the London Stock Exchange (\u201cAdmission\u201d) of the new Placing Shares. Alongside each Placing Share will be issued a warrant to subscribe for one further Share at a price of 2 p (\ntwo pence\nSterling) per Share, exercisable for one year from the date of issue (the \u201cWarrants\u201d). No application shall be made for admission to any list or to trading on any market (regulated or otherwise) of the Warrants.\nFurther to the announcement made by IMC on\n5th August 2019\n, 3,250,000 (three million two hundred and fifty thousand) existing IMC shares were returned to the Company and had been held temporarily as treasury shares by IMC, pending re-sale for cash. These 3,250,000 shares, which had been allotted but for which no consideration had been received by the Company, have now been placed on the same terms as the Placing Shares, resulting in IMC\u2019s receiving a further \u00a332,500 (thirty-two thousand\nfive hundred pounds Sterling\n) before expenses.\nIncrease in Voting Rights Outstanding\nThe total number of voting rights in issue following the allotment of the Placing Shares shall be 311,495,991 (previously, 284,745,991). This new total is the denominator which shareholders should use to determine whether they are obliged to notify IMC of an interest in (or of a change to a notifiable interest in) voting rights. Application is being made for Admission for 26,750,000 Placing Shares.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will be applied for general working capital purposes but, in particular, for the further advancement of IMC\u2019s exploration and geological work on its spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n, and to extend the significant progress already made on IMC\u2019s collaboration with\nTrinity College Dublin\n. Further, IMC will work closely with the Geological Survey of\nIreland\nto continue with the exploration work on IMC\u2019s North Wexford gold project.\nConclusion\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman stated: \u201cWe are pleased to see significant support from new and existing investors. With the price having recently reached an all-time high of\n$2,000\nper troy ounce, this is an auspicious time for gold and, in particular, for IMC with its exciting gold projects in\nSouth East Ireland\n. The Company will move to accelerate progress at the spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow\nand will provide independently-verified updates as they become available.\u201d\nEamon P. O\u2019Brien,Executive Chairman,Dublin, 7th\nSeptember 2020\nThe Directors of IMC, after due and careful enquiry, accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nREGULATORY ANNOUNCEMENT ENDS.\nContact Details\n:\nKeith, Bayley, Rogers & Co.

ON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nVIA\nA REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE (\"RIS\"), THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nIMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nIMC Update Exploration Target for West Avoca Spoils\nHighlights\nUpdated report increases tonnage in West Avoca spoil heaps. Exploration Target in West Avoca estimated at 3,500-4,000 oz gold. Sampling planned to upgrade West Avoca Exploration Target to Inferred Resource. Inferred Resource of 19,800 oz gold previously reported for East Avoca.\nIntroduction\nIMC Exploration Group Plc (IMC), the\nLondon\n-listed gold and base metals explorer in\nIreland\n, is pleased to report the following update based upon a reassessment of tonnages contained in the West Avoca spoil heaps.\nIMC commissioned Trove Metal Ltd (Trove) to review the tonnages contained in the mineralized spoils of the West Avoca Exploration Target as described by CSA Global (CSA) in the 2019 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) report on the Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\n(reported 11th September 2019). The 2020 Trove report considers the West Avoca Exploration Target in isolation. This is in addition to the CSA MRE report for East Avoca (Inferred Resource of 19,800oz gold).\nTrove has entered into an agreement with IMC to establish an environmental clean-up operation to remove metals from the existing mine waste at the Avoca site.\nIMC plans to carry out further sampling on the West Avoca Exploration Target in 2020 to allow an Inferred Resource to be calculated at West Avoca*.\nThe 2020 Trove Report\nThe 2020 Trove report reassessed and recalculated the likely tonnes contained in five defined areas of West Avoca, four of which are represented by surface spoils (S1-4) and one area of backfilled spoils (U1).\nThe CSA Exploration Target tonnage estimate for the West Avoca spoils specified a range from 130,000 to 180,000 tonnes. The 2020 Trove report, with areas and topography of the spoil heaps better defined through detailed assessment of lidar measurements, has calculated that 385,042 tonnes are present. The depth measurements of the spoils are based on conservative estimates of the vertical extent of each stockpile and range from\n2.0m\nto\n4.7m\n. A tonnage factor of 1.6 was used.\nStockpile\nArea (m2)\nVolume (m3)\nTonnes\nS1\n6,483\n30,800\n49,280\nS2\n5,008\n20,031\n32,049\nS3\n4,279\n17,116\n27,386\nS4\n19,918\n59,754\n95,606\nU1\n56,475\n112,950\n180,721\nTotal\n92,163\n240,652\n385,042\nTable 1. Updated tonnage estimates for West Avoca spoils\n(Trove Metal Ltd).\nMinimal grab sampling and analyses have been undertaken on four of the five areas at West Avoca. The results are tabulated below.\nStockpile\nSample ID\nAu g/t\nAg g/t\nS1\nWA 02\n0.51\n4.2\nS2\nWA 01\n0.33\n3.5\nS3\nWA 04\n0.35\n8.0\nS4\nWA 03\n0.27\n6.9\nU1\nNot Sampled\nTable 2. Grab sampling at West Avoca (Trove Metal Ltd).\nCSA provide a grade range of 0.3 \u2013 0.6 g/t Au for the West Avoca spoil heaps Exploration Target. Using the lower estimate of 0.3 g/t Au (which is also the grade of the JORC-compliant CSA MRE in East Avoca) an Exploration Target in the region of 3,500-4,000 oz Au is reasonable for West Avoca using the updated tonnage estimate in the 2020 Trove report.\nThese re-estimated values for the number of tonnes likely to be present (and associated gold content) will benefit from more detailed exploration, specifically detailed sampling at regular lateral and vertical intervals to firm-up the Exploration Target into an Inferred Resource.\n*As an Exploration Target under the JORC (2012) code the estimates for West Avoca contained in the Trove report cannot be included as a resource as the potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, and that there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource.\nThe CSA MRE\nIn\nSeptember 2019\n, IMC published an MRE on its Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\nspoils and tailings project located in\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n. The JORC-compliant MRE report shows, inter alia, significant grades of extracted and crushed gold (1,871,000t at 0.3g/t Au), copper (1,871,000t at 0.14% Cu) and lead (1,871,000t at 0.42% Pb) in the spoil heaps on the East Avoca part of the site.\nMineralogical testing is ongoing, and it is also anticipated that this will confirm that a sizeable quantity of gold and metals will be recoverable at low cost, given that the material has already been extracted and crushed. IMC, Trove and CSA believe there are reasonable prospects for the eventual economic extraction of the Mineral Resources.\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulti"
