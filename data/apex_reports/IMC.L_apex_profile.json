UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\"IMC\" or the \"Company\")\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company announces the successful renewal of its mining licence to Assat LLC, IMC's 100% owned subsidiary, for the Karaberd Mine, located in Lori Marz province, Republic of Armenia,\nIMC is delighted to announce the renewal of its mining licence to Assat LLC, IMC's 100% owned subsidiary, for the Karaberd Mine, located in Lori Marz province Republic of Armenia.\nThe licence has been renewed for a period of 9 (nine) years until 1\nst\nJanuary 2035.\nThe renewed licence provides for underground extraction of 30,000 tons of ore per annum and a requirement to submit a reserve revaluation report to the authorized body two years after receiving the right to use the subsoil, which should also include the reserves available in the open pit.\nUnder the renewed Licence Assat LLC has a right to extract up to 1,274 kg of gold and 2,310 kg of silver.\nThe renewal was awarded by the Minister for Territorial Administration and Infrastructures of the Republic of Armenia by way of amendments to the original licence\nNO.\nt\nU@-29/366.\nThe extended tenure of the licence to 2035 secures the long-term future of the mine and enables the systematic extraction of the ore that will be processed to extract Gold and Silver.\nChairman, Eamon O'Brien commented\n\"I am extremely pleased and happy for IMC, for our shareholders,\nincluding\nour major shareholder Mineral Ventures Invest s.r.o. and its CEO David Marasek who have provided steadfast support to IMC since the Karaberd mine acquisition, for our new Assat LLC CEO, Armand Pinarbasi, who along with our staff and corporate, legal and geological advisers achieved this major milestone.\nAfter IMC first achieved its full listing on the main market of the LSE, its first target acquisition was to acquire the Karaberd mine and while we have had lengthy and varied issues to navigate along the way, as explained in previous announcements, the renewal of the Karaberd mine licence could not have come at a better time when Gold and Silver have hit record prices per Oz having recently surpassed $5,000 Au and $100 Ag respectively.\nThe renewal that went through a very rigorous regulatory assessment, including through the Armenian Minister for Environment and four public hearings, also confirms the Company's good standing with the Armenian regulatory authorities\".\nOther Information\nAt this time, it is also worth noting that the Competent Persons Report update for the minerals deposit, dated 26th June 2023 for the Karaberd mine, as prepared by AMC Consultants of Perth, Australia for the purposes of assessing the approval by IMC shareholders of the Karaberd mine related acquisition, in October 2023, was set out as follows:\nMineral Resource Estimate Table showing Indicated and Inferred\nProduction\nASSAT LLC is currently finalising agreements in relation to ore enrichment and production of concentrate from its ore and then further processing of that concentrate to final 999 gold and silver products.\nUpdates will be provided on the finalisation of these agreements.\nArmenian Stock Exchange Dual Listing\nArmand Pinarbasi, the new IMC Board business development director\n(\nhttps://www.imcexploration.com/corporate/board-of-directors\n), commented\n\"following the successful renewal of the Karaberd Mining licence, and with the advantage of a current strong Gold and Silver price, IMC is now well placed to progress this added listing. This listing will enhance local liquidity and further strengthen the Company's standing within the Armenian capital markets\".\nEamon P.

Alongside each Placing Share will be issued a warrant to subscribe for one further Share at a price of 2 p (\ntwo pence\nSterling) per Share, exercisable for one year from the date of issue (the \u201cWarrants\u201d). No application shall be made for admission to any list or to trading on any market (regulated or otherwise) of the Warrants.\nFurther to the announcement made by IMC on\n5th August 2019\n, 3,250,000 (three million two hundred and fifty thousand) existing IMC shares were returned to the Company and had been held temporarily as treasury shares by IMC, pending re-sale for cash. These 3,250,000 shares, which had been allotted but for which no consideration had been received by the Company, have now been placed on the same terms as the Placing Shares, resulting in IMC\u2019s receiving a further \u00a332,500 (thirty-two thousand\nfive hundred pounds Sterling\n) before expenses.\nIncrease in Voting Rights Outstanding\nThe total number of voting rights in issue following the allotment of the Placing Shares shall be 311,495,991 (previously, 284,745,991). This new total is the denominator which shareholders should use to determine whether they are obliged to notify IMC of an interest in (or of a change to a notifiable interest in) voting rights. Application is being made for Admission for 26,750,000 Placing Shares.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will be applied for general working capital purposes but, in particular, for the further advancement of IMC\u2019s exploration and geological work on its spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n, and to extend the significant progress already made on IMC\u2019s collaboration with\nTrinity College Dublin\n. Further, IMC will work closely with the Geological Survey of\nIreland\nto continue with the exploration work on IMC\u2019s North Wexford gold project.\nConclusion\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman stated: \u201cWe are pleased to see significant support from new and existing investors. With the price having recently reached an all-time high of\n$2,000\nper troy ounce, this is an auspicious time for gold and, in particular, for IMC with its exciting gold projects in\nSouth East Ireland\n. The Company will move to accelerate progress at the spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow\nand will provide independently-verified updates as they become available.\u201d\nEamon P. O\u2019Brien,Executive Chairman,Dublin, 7th\nSeptember 2020\nThe Directors of IMC, after due and careful enquiry, accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nREGULATORY ANNOUNCEMENT ENDS.\nContact Details\n:\nKeith, Bayley, Rogers & Co.

Exploration Target in West Avoca estimated at 3,500-4,000 oz gold. Sampling planned to upgrade West Avoca Exploration Target to Inferred Resource. Inferred Resource of 19,800 oz gold previously reported for East Avoca.\nIntroduction\nIMC Exploration Group Plc (IMC), the\nLondon\n-listed gold and base metals explorer in\nIreland\n, is pleased to report the following update based upon a reassessment of tonnages contained in the West Avoca spoil heaps.\nIMC commissioned Trove Metal Ltd (Trove) to review the tonnages contained in the mineralized spoils of the West Avoca Exploration Target as described by CSA Global (CSA) in the 2019 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) report on the Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\n(reported 11th September 2019). The 2020 Trove report considers the West Avoca Exploration Target in isolation. This is in addition to the CSA MRE report for East Avoca (Inferred Resource of 19,800oz gold).\nTrove has entered into an agreement with IMC to establish an environmental clean-up operation to remove metals from the existing mine waste at the Avoca site.\nIMC plans to carry out further sampling on the West Avoca Exploration Target in 2020 to allow an Inferred Resource to be calculated at West Avoca*.\nThe 2020 Trove Report\nThe 2020 Trove report reassessed and recalculated the likely tonnes contained in five defined areas of West Avoca, four of which are represented by surface spoils (S1-4) and one area of backfilled spoils (U1).\nThe CSA Exploration Target tonnage estimate for the West Avoca spoils specified a range from 130,000 to 180,000 tonnes. The 2020 Trove report, with areas and topography of the spoil heaps better defined through detailed assessment of lidar measurements, has calculated that 385,042 tonnes are present. The depth measurements of the spoils are based on conservative estimates of the vertical extent of each stockpile and range from\n2.0m\nto\n4.7m\n. A tonnage factor of 1.6 was used.\nStockpile\nArea (m2)\nVolume (m3)\nTonnes\nS1\n6,483\n30,800\n49,280\nS2\n5,008\n20,031\n32,049\nS3\n4,279\n17,116\n27,386\nS4\n19,918\n59,754\n95,606\nU1\n56,475\n112,950\n180,721\nTotal\n92,163\n240,652\n385,042\nTable 1. Updated tonnage estimates for West Avoca spoils\n(Trove Metal Ltd).\nMinimal grab sampling and analyses have been undertaken on four of the five areas at West Avoca. The results are tabulated below.\nStockpile\nSample ID\nAu g/t\nAg g/t\nS1\nWA 02\n0.51\n4.2\nS2\nWA 01\n0.33\n3.5\nS3\nWA 04\n0.35\n8.0\nS4\nWA 03\n0.27\n6.9\nU1\nNot Sampled\nTable 2. Grab sampling at West Avoca (Trove Metal Ltd).\nCSA provide a grade range of 0.3 \u2013 0.6 g/t Au for the West Avoca spoil heaps Exploration Target. Using the lower estimate of 0.3 g/t Au (which is also the grade of the JORC-compliant CSA MRE in East Avoca) an Exploration Target in the region of 3,500-4,000 oz Au is reasonable for West Avoca using the updated tonnage estimate in the 2020 Trove report.\nThese re-estimated values for the number of tonnes likely to be present (and associated gold content) will benefit from more detailed exploration, specifically detailed sampling at regular lateral and vertical intervals to firm-up the Exploration Target into an Inferred Resource.\n*As an Exploration Target under the JORC (2012) code the estimates for West Avoca contained in the Trove report cannot be included as a resource as the potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, and that there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource.\nThe CSA MRE\nIn\nSeptember 2019\n, IMC published an MRE on its Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\nspoils and tailings project located in\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n. The JORC-compliant MRE report shows, inter alia, significant grades of extracted and crushed gold (1,871,000t at 0.3g/t Au), copper (1,871,000t at 0.14% Cu) and lead (1,871,000t at 0.42% Pb) in the spoil heaps on the East Avoca part of the site.\nMineralogical testing is ongoing, and it is also anticipated that this will confirm that a sizeable quantity of gold and metals will be recoverable at low cost, given that the material has already been extracted and crushed. IMC, Trove and CSA believe there are reasonable prospects for the eventual economic extraction of the Mineral Resources.\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulti"
