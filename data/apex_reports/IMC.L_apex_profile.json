UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\"IMC\" or the \"Company\")\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company announces the successful renewal of its mining licence to Assat LLC, IMC's 100% owned subsidiary, for the Karaberd Mine, located in Lori Marz province, Republic of Armenia,\nIMC is delighted to announce the renewal of its mining licence to Assat LLC, IMC's 100% owned subsidiary, for the Karaberd Mine, located in Lori Marz province Republic of Armenia.\nThe licence has been renewed for a period of 9 (nine) years until 1\nst\nJanuary 2035.\nThe renewed licence provides for underground extraction of 30,000 tons of ore per annum and a requirement to submit a reserve revaluation report to the authorized body two years after receiving the right to use the subsoil, which should also include the reserves available in the open pit.\nUnder the renewed Licence Assat LLC has a right to extract up to 1,274 kg of gold and 2,310 kg of silver.\nThe renewal was awarded by the Minister for Territorial Administration and Infrastructures of the Republic of Armenia by way of amendments to the original licence\nNO.\nt\nU@-29/366.\nThe extended tenure of the licence to 2035 secures the long-term future of the mine and enables the systematic extraction of the ore that will be processed to extract Gold and Silver.\nChairman, Eamon O'Brien commented\n\"I am extremely pleased and happy for IMC, for our shareholders,\nincluding\nour major shareholder Mineral Ventures Invest s.r.o. and its CEO David Marasek who have provided steadfast support to IMC since the Karaberd mine acquisition, for our new Assat LLC CEO, Armand Pinarbasi, who along with our staff and corporate, legal and geological advisers achieved this major milestone.\nAfter IMC first achieved its full listing on the main market of the LSE, its first target acquisition was to acquire the Karaberd mine and while we have had lengthy and varied issues to navigate along the way, as explained in previous announcements, the renewal of the Karaberd mine licence could not have come at a better time when Gold and Silver have hit record prices per Oz having recently surpassed $5,000 Au and $100 Ag respectively.\nThe renewal that went through a very rigorous regulatory assessment, including through the Armenian Minister for Environment and four public hearings, also confirms the Company's good standing with the Armenian regulatory authorities\".\nOther Information\nAt this time, it is also worth noting that the Competent Persons Report update for the minerals deposit, dated 26th June 2023 for the Karaberd mine, as prepared by AMC Consultants of Perth, Australia for the purposes of assessing the approval by IMC shareholders of the Karaberd mine related acquisition, in October 2023, was set out as follows:\nMineral Resource Estimate Table showing Indicated and Inferred\nProduction\nASSAT LLC is currently finalising agreements in relation to ore enrichment and production of concentrate from its ore and then further processing of that concentrate to final 999 gold and silver products.\nUpdates will be provided on the finalisation of these agreements.\nArmenian Stock Exchange Dual Listing\nArmand Pinarbasi, the new IMC Board business development director\n(\nhttps://www.imcexploration.com/corporate/board-of-directors\n), commented\n\"following the successful renewal of the Karaberd Mining licence, and with the advantage of a current strong Gold and Silver price, IMC is now well placed to progress this added listing. This listing will enhance local liquidity and further strengthen the Company's standing within the Armenian capital markets\".\nEamon P.

Alongside each Placing Share will be issued a warrant to subscribe for one further Share at a price of 2 p (\ntwo pence\nSterling) per Share, exercisable for one year from the date of issue (the \u201cWarrants\u201d). No application shall be made for admission to any list or to trading on any market (regulated or otherwise) of the Warrants.\nFurther to the announcement made by IMC on\n5th August 2019\n, 3,250,000 (three million two hundred and fifty thousand) existing IMC shares were returned to the Company and had been held temporarily as treasury shares by IMC, pending re-sale for cash. These 3,250,000 shares, which had been allotted but for which no consideration had been received by the Company, have now been placed on the same terms as the Placing Shares, resulting in IMC\u2019s receiving a further \u00a332,500 (thirty-two thousand\nfive hundred pounds Sterling\n) before expenses.\nIncrease in Voting Rights Outstanding\nThe total number of voting rights in issue following the allotment of the Placing Shares shall be 311,495,991 (previously, 284,745,991). This new total is the denominator which shareholders should use to determine whether they are obliged to notify IMC of an interest in (or of a change to a notifiable interest in) voting rights. Application is being made for Admission for 26,750,000 Placing Shares.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will be applied for general working capital purposes but, in particular, for the further advancement of IMC\u2019s exploration and geological work on its spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n, and to extend the significant progress already made on IMC\u2019s collaboration with\nTrinity College Dublin\n. Further, IMC will work closely with the Geological Survey of\nIreland\nto continue with the exploration work on IMC\u2019s North Wexford gold project.\nConclusion\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman stated: \u201cWe are pleased to see significant support from new and existing investors. With the price having recently reached an all-time high of\n$2,000\nper troy ounce, this is an auspicious time for gold and, in particular, for IMC with its exciting gold projects in\nSouth East Ireland\n. The Company will move to accelerate progress at the spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow\nand will provide independently-verified updates as they become available.\u201d\nEamon P.

Exploration Target in West Avoca estimated at 3,500-4,000 oz gold. Sampling planned to upgrade West Avoca Exploration Target to Inferred Resource. Inferred Resource of 19,800 oz gold previously reported for East Avoca.\nIntroduction\nIMC Exploration Group Plc (IMC), the\nLondon\n-listed gold and base metals explorer in\nIreland\n, is pleased to report the following update based upon a reassessment of tonnages contained in the West Avoca spoil heaps.\nIMC commissioned Trove Metal Ltd (Trove) to review the tonnages contained in the mineralized spoils of the West Avoca Exploration Target as described by CSA Global (CSA) in the 2019 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) report on the Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\n(reported 11th September 2019). The 2020 Trove report considers the West Avoca Exploration Target in isolation. This is in addition to the CSA MRE report for East Avoca (Inferred Resource of 19,800oz gold).\nTrove has entered into an agreement with IMC to establish an environmental clean-up operation to remove metals from the existing mine waste at the Avoca site.\nIMC plans to carry out further sampling on the West Avoca Exploration Target in 2020 to allow an Inferred Resource to be calculated at West Avoca*.\nThe 2020 Trove Report\nThe 2020 Trove report reassessed and recalculated the likely tonnes contained in five defined areas of West Avoca, four of which are represented by surface spoils (S1-4) and one area of backfilled spoils (U1).\nThe CSA Exploration Target tonnage estimate for the West Avoca spoils specified a range from 130,000 to 180,000 tonnes. The 2020 Trove report, with areas and topography of the spoil heaps better defined through detailed assessment of lidar measurements, has calculated that 385,042 tonnes are present. The depth measurements of the spoils are based on conservative estimates of the vertical extent of each stockpile and range from\n2.0m\nto\n4.7m\n. A tonnage factor of 1.6 was used.\nStockpile\nArea (m2)\nVolume (m3)\nTonnes\nS1\n6,483\n30,800\n49,280\nS2\n5,008\n20,031\n32,049\nS3\n4,279\n17,116\n27,386\nS4\n19,918\n59,754\n95,606\nU1\n56,475\n112,950\n180,721\nTotal\n92,163\n240,652\n385,042\nTable 1. Updated tonnage estimates for West Avoca spoils\n(Trove Metal Ltd).\nMinimal grab sampling and analyses have been undertaken on four of the five areas at West Avoca. The results are tabulated below.\nStockpile\nSample ID\nAu g/t\nAg g/t\nS1\nWA 02\n0.51\n4.2\nS2\nWA 01\n0.33\n3.5\nS3\nWA 04\n0.35\n8.0\nS4\nWA 03\n0.27\n6.9\nU1\nNot Sampled\nTable 2. Grab sampling at West Avoca (Trove Metal Ltd).\nCSA provide a grade range of 0.3 \u2013 0.6 g/t Au for the West Avoca spoil heaps Exploration Target. Using the lower estimate of 0.3 g/t Au (which is also the grade of the JORC-compliant CSA MRE in East Avoca) an Exploration Target in the region of 3,500-4,000 oz Au is reasonable for West Avoca using the updated tonnage estimate in the 2020 Trove report.\nThese re-estimated values for the number of tonnes likely to be present (and associated gold content) will benefit from more detailed exploration, specifically detailed sampling at regular lateral and vertical intervals to firm-up the Exploration Target into an Inferred Resource.\n*As an Exploration Target under the JORC (2012) code the estimates for West Avoca contained in the Trove report cannot be included as a resource as the potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, and that there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource.\nThe CSA MRE\nIn\nSeptember 2019\n, IMC published an MRE on its Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\nspoils and tailings project located in\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n. The JORC-compliant MRE report shows, inter alia, significant grades of extracted and crushed gold (1,871,000t at 0.3g/t Au), copper (1,871,000t at 0.14% Cu) and lead (1,871,000t at 0.42% Pb) in the spoil heaps on the East Avoca part of the site.\nMineralogical testing is ongoing, and it is also anticipated that this will confirm that a sizeable quantity of gold and metals will be recoverable at low cost, given that the material has already been extracted and crushed. IMC, Trove and CSA believe there are reasonable prospects for the eventual economic extraction of the Mineral Resources.\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulti"

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nFINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 1 st JULY 2024 TO 30 th JUNE 2025\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\"IMC\" or the \"Company\")\nChairman's Statement\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nfor the year ended 30 June 2025\nThe Directors of IMC Exploration Group plc (\"IMC\" or the \"Company\") are pleased to present the final financial results for IMC for the twelve months to 30th June 2025.\nThis has been a year when further progress has been made on a number of projects and there have been two major post balance sheet developments of note.\nArmand Pinarbasi, former Managing Partner Grant Thornton Armenia, has been appointed to the Company's Board as an Executive Director with immediate effect and he has also been appointed as Chief Executive Officer of IMC's Armenian mining subsidiary, ASSAT LLC. In addition,\nLum\u00edr Va\u0161t\u00edk\n, a long-term partner in the Company's shareholder Mineral Ventures Invest s.r.o (\"MVI\") will become the Deputy Director of ASSAT LLC.\nThe conversion into ordinary shares in the Company of all loans provided by MVI to IMC up to the date of completion of the reverse take-over on 31 October 2023. The amount loaned up to 31 October 2023 by MVI totalled \u20ac702,286 (equivalent to \u00a3613,350) and is being converted on the basis of an IMC share price of 0.75p into 81,780,029 new ordinary shares in the Company.\nArmand has been providing assistance with our developments in Armenia and is currently in discussions with the Armenian Stock Exchange with regard to moving forward IMC's application for a dual listing on that exchange. We are delighted to welcome Armand to the management team where Armand will also take on, at IMC Board level, the role of business development, not only in Armenia, but in the South Caucasus countries and in Eastern Europe where a number of opportunities are opening and especially for those companies with a proven eco-mining solution. Prior to joining IMC, Armand served as Group CEO of SoftConstruct, a multinational technology group with 6,000+ employees. Before that, Armand spent more than 20 years at Grant Thornton, holding senior leadership roles including Managing Partner of Grant Thornton Armenia, Partner at Grant Thornton in France, where he also served as Managing Partner Grant Thornton PACA region (Nice, Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur) for nine years, and Executive Director for Network Member Relations at Grant Thornton International.\nThe conversion of \u20ac702,286 of debt to equity strengthens the balance sheet, reducing interest costs, improving the debt-to-equity ratio and financial stability, and is in keeping with IMC's strategy to grow the company and make it attractive to new investors as we prepare for a dual listing on the Armenian Stock Exchange.\nIRISH OPERATIONS\nSummary:\nIMC, considering the significant increasing price of an Oz of gold and silver from $1,226 and $14.5 per Oz respectively, when IMC completed its 2018 JORC compliant inferred Mineral Resource Estimate, to the end June 2025 values of $3,264 and $36 respectively, and given the very encouraging results from the drilling on the Wexford licence PL2551 along with the up to three potential projects to be associated with IMC's two Avoca licences, it was decided that IMC should focus its investment in the Avoca licences PL 3850 and PL 3849 and the Wexford PL2551, and accordingly IMC gave up licences 1199 and 1200.\nThe Avoca Project - PL 3850 and PL 3849\nIMC undertook further works on Avoca. These were carried out by Trove Metal and inspection was carried out by the relevant Government department. This resulted in a mid-estimated increase (+650,000 tons) in the tonnage of spoils and tailings from 1,871,000 to 2,521,000.\nAs I write, and based on the Grade-tonnage estimate for the waste heaps at Avoca table\n(Page 6 CSA Global Report N\no\nR369.2018)\nof the MRE plus the increased tonnage the following table sets out the gross value of the metals contained in the waste heaps made up of spoils and tailings -\nA number of important events favourable to progression of our Avoca project have also taken place as follows:\n\u00b7\n29 November 2024 - a new Irish Government was elected.\nThis new government is very enthusiastic about development of Ireland's mineral resources.\n\u00b7\nThe European Union have passed a Nature Restoration Law requiring member countries to restore 30% of damaged habitats.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nHALF-YEARLY FINANCIAL REPORT\nFOR THE PERIOD 1st\nJULY 2024\nTO 31st\nDECEMBER 2024\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nThe Directors of IMC are pleased to present the Company\u2019s unaudited, consolidated, half-yearly financial report for the six-month period ended\n31 December 2024\n.\nSince my last report the environment for exploration and mining companies has improved greatly.\nNew EU rules have come in to effect including the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) that requires member states to put in place projects that enable both the extraction and processing of such critical metals as copper, lithium and cobalt that are used in clean energy and digital systems.\nThe Institute of Geologists of\nIreland\nhave stated that meeting the CRMA objectives will include revisiting closed mines and mine waste facilities.\nThis is particularly relevant to IMC as IMC is currently working on plans to process its spoils and tailings in Avoca, there being over \u00a380m in metals\nin this waste material sitting above ground, based on calculations from the inferred metal resources, as set out in the IMC MRE completed by CSA Global. IMC\u2019s previously completed Mineral Resource Estimate in this regard identified additional exploration targets on the Avoca PL3850 including at Connary. IMC has recently completed further excavations related to its spoils and tailings at the Connary location with the objective of adding to its current MRE estimate. As soon as the results are available and the relevant geological report is completed IMC will announce its results.\nFurthermore, and as stated in my last report, we are reviewing the potential to re-open the old Avoca copper mine, given the significant increase in the price of copper and given the designation of copper as a critical raw material. We are also pleased to note the appointment of Minister for Climate Environment and Energy, Darragh O\u2019Brien, who is keen to advance Irelands exploration and mining industries especially relating to CRM\u2019s.\nLocated to the northeast of the historical Avoca Mine (PL3850), regional sampling and logging of drill core from PL3849 has indicated significant regional prospectivity for Cu and Au on the Licence. The Caledonide range of southeast\nIreland\nfeatures an Ordovician volcano-sedimentary sequence hosting VMS mineralization and ironstones interpreted as having formed from hydrothermal exhalative activity. Understanding their spatial relationships, bulk geochemistry and mineralogy can aid in the detection of concealed deposits.\nFor that reason, IMC has sent a total of 20 samples with mineralization from its 3 drill holes at Kilmacurra for petrographic characterization and metallurgical analysis to a number of laboratories, including iCRAG, and for isotope analysis at NordSim in\nStockholm\n. Similar analysis has also been commissioned on 20 samples of spoils from the decommissioned\nBallard Iron Mine\nthat also fall within IMC\u2019s PL3849.\nAgain, when the relevant reports are completed, the results will be published.\nI am pleased to report that following a recent visit to\nArmenia\n, IMC can report progress in a number of areas.\nIMC\u2019s presentation to a number of Armenian Government officials in regard to future mining projects, including remediation of toxic waste sites, and investment into the related local communities was well received.\nIMC also met with the EU Ambassador to\nArmenia\n,\nVassilis Maragos\n, and the Czech Ambassador\nPetr Piruncik\n. Mr. Piruncik is happy to be encouraging to IMC\u2019s interests in\nArmenia\ngiven that IMC\u2019s major shareholder after completion of the recent RTO is Czech.\nIMC also had a very positive meeting with the CEO of the Armenian Securities Exchange (AMX),\nHayk Yeganyan\n. The AMX would be pleased to have IMC as a dual listed entity on their exchange and as I mentioned in my last report IMC is working with its\nGrant Thornton\nteam in\nArmenia\nto bring that about.\nIn relation to the future processing of IMC\u2019s ore held by IMC\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary Assat, we have made some progress at last.\nUp to now, the situation was challenging since the only possibility to refine ore was through the Ararat Zavod \u2013 GPM Gold plant, where Assat previously refined about 33,000 tons of ore and produced 46.2kg of gold. However, since GPM Gold belongs to Russian owners \u2013 the imposed sanctions and politi",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nFINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 1st\nJULY 2023\nTO 30th\nJUNE 2024\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nfor the year ended\n30 June 2024\nThe Directors of IMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) are pleased to present the final financial results for IMC for the twelve months to\n30th June 2024\n.\nThe year to end\nJune 2024\nhas been very important and exciting for IMC and its shareholders culminating in approval of the acquisition of MVI Ireland s.r.o., the owner of Assat LLC that owns the Karaberd Mine, a gold mine located in\nLori Marz\n, northern\nArmenia\n. This acquisition, as approved at the EGM which took place on\n26th October 2023\n, will be transformative for IMC. The Company is no longer just a minerals exploration company but a mining company as well.\nThe acquisition of the Karaberd Mine for which an extension of licence has been applied for to be followed by an application to extend the mining licence area and the construction of a metals extraction facility, for which a virtual model has been prepared(link:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02lA0Fdyg58\n) and for which planning application documents have also been prepared along with the scheduling of the related public meeting, means a busy number of months ahead for the Company in\nArmenia\n.\nThe production facility which will be owned by associates of IMC\u2019s major investor Mineral Ventures Invest spol. s.r.o. (\u201cMVI\u201d) will, when completed, be leased by IMC with an option to purchase, and will serve the existing strategic direction of IMC, while expanding the geographic scope of its operations. Indeed, the importance of such a production facility is further emphasised by the fact that due to a lack of ore processing facilities in\nArmenia\nover the last year, (both GPM Ararat and Masis plant closed for upgrades and the Arjut plant just started production of their own ore in\nMarch 2024\n), Assat LLC, IMC\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary through its subsidiary MVI Ireland s.r.o. that operates the Karaberd mine, has stock piled c. 18,000 tons of ore grading on average 1.8gt \u2013 2.00gt with c. 800 tons of that grading on average 22g/t waiting to be processed.\nThe successful acquisition of MVI Ireland s.r.o. has also led to a strengthening of the IMC Board with the addition of two new directors namely\nVahagn Marukhyan\n, appointed as Group CFO, who is based in\nYerevan, Armenia\n, where for 14 years he previously held senior positions at Ernst & Young latterly as a head of the Strategy and Transactions practice and\nGagik Gevorgyan\nwho is a leading Armenian geologist with over 45 years of experience in mining and quarrying.\nGagik has previously served as Director of Central Geological Expedition in\nArmenia\nand Chief Geologist to a number of mining companies in\nArmenia\n.\nGlenn Millar\none of the founding members of the Company retired from the Board and we wish him well in his retirement and thank him for all his valuable contributions over the years.\nIMC has continued to develop relationships in\nArmenia\nat national and local level and has developed a pipeline of other prospective projects, including prospective Au, Cu and Ag projects, which IMC hopes to finalise in the next number of months.\nIn that regard, as part of the Framework Agreement concluded between IMC and MVI, and announced on\n15th April 2021\n, there was provided a clause that enabled MVI to increase its shareholding from 51% up to 59.17% subject to introducing into the Company projects that would increase the IMC market capitalisation up to \u00a3200m. One such project relates to the Ferro Group LLC (\u201dFG\u201d) South Eastern VLAD deposit within the Tukhmanuk ore field of the Aragatsotn region in\nArmenia\n.\nAMC Consultants (\nPerth, Australia\n) have been contracted by MVI to carry out a\n1,000m\ndrill program and should the results prove an economic resource exists then MVI have the option to acquire a 60% stake in the FG which would be on-boarded to IMC.\nArmenia\nas a country, is on solid track of economic expansion, with the GDP growth still around 8% in 2023 and strong inflow of Foreign Direct Investment to the country.\nThe Armenian dram (AMD) continues to be the strongest currency in the world.\nStrengthening against the Euro by about 50% since\nDec 2000\n(640 to 420 as of\nJune 2024\n) and 28% against the",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nHALF-YEARLY FINANCIAL REPORT\nFOR THE PERIOD 1st\nJULY 2023\nTO 31st\nDECEMBER 2023\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nThe Directors of IMC are pleased to present the Company\u2019s unaudited, consolidated, half-yearly financial report for the six-month period ended\n31 December 2023\n.\nThe six months under review have been very significant for IMC and its shareholders, with the successful completion, in\nOctober 2023\n, of the acquisition of MVI Ireland s.r.o. (\u201cMVI\u201d), the 100% owner of the Armenian company, Assat LLC, which owns and operates the Karaberd Mine, an operating gold mine located in\nLori Marz\n,\nNorthern Armenia\n.\nThe acquisition of MVI constituted a reverse takeover under the Listing Rules and as required by the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s updated rule on a minimum required market capitalisation of \u00a330m for a company undertaking such a transaction, we were pleased that international consultants Alvarez and Marsal conducted a valuation of MVI, in accordance with the International Valuation Standards (IVS, 2020), that demonstrated a value in excess of the required threshold of \u00a330m.\nSince the completion of the acquisition of MVI on\n1 November 2023\nwe have been delighted by the performance at the Karaberd mine and the extraction of ore continues, including a sale of ore in\nDecember 2023\nfor a consideration of \u20ac1,500,000.\nWe believe there is great potential in\nArmenia\n, both with the Karaberd mine and more widely.\nWe are continuing to review other projects in\nArmenia\n, and all at IMC believe that operating in\nArmenia\nwill provide significant future growth opportunities.\nI am also pleased that following our acquisition of MVI we have, post period end, strengthened the IMC Board with a new CFO,\nVahagn Marukhyan\n, who has significant experience with Ernst & Young in\nArmenia\n, and a geologist,\nGagik Gevorgyan\n, who has worked as chief geologist in\nArmenia\nwith a number of mining companies and who has a tremendous knowledge of projects in\nArmenia\nthat are likely to form part of the IMC pipeline of projects going forward.\nIn\nIreland\n, IMC has a mineral-rich supply of spoils and tailings with a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) on its Avoca spoils and tailings.\nBased on the Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate there are circa. 20,000 oz gold, 600,000oz silver, 2,600 tonnes copper and 7,800 tonnes lead in these spoils and tailings heaps, which are in crushed rock sitting above ground.\nAt current commodity metal prices, this represents a total gross value of \u00a371,346,400.\nIMC has the intention to advance the Avoca opportunity as an eco-remediation project, aligning closely with the goals outlined by both the Irish government and the objectives of the European Union.\nTo progress this opportunity, at IMC\u2019s invitation, China National Geological & Mining Corporation (\u201cCGM\u201d), who have experience working global projects and especially have experience in eco-based extraction of metals and the remediation of mining sites, recently visited our Avoca site to assess how further progress should be made.\nI am pleased to say that following this visit we have completed and signed a Memorandum of Understanding for Cooperation with CGM and I look forward to the completion of a project plan to maximise the potential of our Avoca site given the gross value of metals sitting in the spoils and tailings and also given that the\nEuropean Union has passed a Nature Restoration Law requiring the restoration of up to 20% of lands and sea by 2030.\nWe believe that this will also give impetus to our proposed remediation of the 155-acre Avoca mine site.\nWe are also reviewing the potential for further copper extraction on our Avoca licence given the significant increase in copper prices since mining stopped in Avoca in 1982.\nAlso in\nIreland\n, I am very encouraged by the recent drilling results from IMC\u2019s North Wexford Gold Project which confirms\ninterpretation of two structural zones, up to 20 metre (\u201cm\u201d) wide, associated with gold (\u201cAu\u201d) mineralization.\nAn historic drillhole intercepted\n1.5m\ngrading 354g/t Au, interpreted as part of an upper, near surface zone of mineralization and a lower zone of\n2m\ngrading 1.4g/t Au. The new drillhole extends these zones of mineralization by\n150m\nto the northeast and intersected grades of\n1m\ngrading 5.8g/t Au in the upper zone and\n1m\ngrading 1.1g/t A",

Wexford, Ireland\nIMC Exploration Group plc (IMC), the\nLondon\nlisted exploration company based in\nIreland\n, is pleased to announce assay results from a drillhole at its Boley project on PL 2551,\nCo. Wexford, Ireland\n.\nHighlights\nNew drillhole 24-2551-04 confirms interpretation of two structural zones, up to 20 metre (\u201cm\u201d) wide, associated with gold (\u201cAu\u201d) mineralization.\nHistoric drillhole intercepted\n1.5m\ngrading 354g/t Au, interpreted as part of an upper, near surface zone of mineralization and a lower zone of\n2m\ngrading 1.4g/t Au.\nNew drillhole 24-2551-01 extends these zones of mineralization by\n150m\nto the northeast and intersected grades of\n1m\ngrading 5.8g/t Au in the upper zone and\n1m\ngrading 1.1g/t Au in the lower zone.\nBoth the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth.\nGeological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present.\nIMC identified an area of extensive anomalous gold values in panned concentrates and in 2012 first drilled the Boley target.\nThis drillhole intersected two zones of gold mineralization with the upper zone associated with a bonanza grade quartz boulder with visible gold which assayed 354g/t Au over a\n1.5m\ninterval.\nThe lower zone contained values of\n2m\ngrading 1.4g/t Au.\nDrillhole 24-2551-01 was designed to test the interpreted strike extent of the two zones of gold mineralization\n150m\nto the northeast.\nThe drillhole intersected both mineralized zones and returned values of\n1m\ngrading 5.8g/t Au from 90.5 \u2013\n91.5m\nin the upper zone and\n1m\ngrading 1.1g/t Au from 139.5 \u2013\n140.5m\nin the lower zone.\nBackground gold values are present throughout both zones, which are interpreted as shear zones, and are considered prospective for orogenic style gold mineralization.\nThe drillhole reached a depth of\n172.5m\n.\nThe mineralization is present in wide zones of quartz-veined sediments (\n6m\nand\n20m\nwide respectively) of which the upper zone is interpreted as the probable host of the 354g/t Au bonanza grade boulder.\nGeological analysis suggests that there may be several parallel structures in the immediate area, yet untested, which are open along strike and to depth.\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Executive Chairman of IMC, commented:\n\u201cDetailed geological analysis of the Boley prospect following up on the bonanza grade quartz boulder drilled in earlier exploration programmes has enhanced the prospectivity of the area.\nThe recent drillhole has reinforced this interpretation and future work will continue to evaluate the shear zones at Boley to determine the source of the bonanza grade boulder. I look forward to providing further updates in due course, as appropriate.\u201d\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulting geologist and a Competent Person as described in the JORC 2012 reporting code.\nThe Directors of IMC, after due and careful enquiry, accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nEamon P.

ON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE (\"RIS\"), THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nFINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 1ST\nJULY 2022\nTO 30TH\nJUNE 2023\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nChairman\u2019s Statement for the year ended\n30 June 2023\nThe Directors of IMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) are pleased to present the audited financial results for IMC for the twelve months to 30\nth\nJune 2023\n.\nThe financial statements which follow are extracted from, but do not constitute, the audited annual financial report of the Company for the above period.\nThe unedited full text of the annual financial report is being submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be available at:\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\n, as well as on the Company\u2019s website\nhttps://www.imcexploration.com\n.\nThe year to end\nJune 2023\nhas been very important and exciting for IMC and its shareholders as have the subsequent few months, culminating in approval of the acquisition of MVI Ireland s.r.o., the owner of Assat LLC that owns the Karaberd Mine, an operating gold mine located in\nLori Marz\n, northern\nArmenia\n. This acquisition, as approved at the EGM which took place on 26\nth\nOctober 2023\n, will be transformative for IMC. The Company will no longer be just a minerals exploration company but a mining company as well.\nThe acquisition of the Karaberd Mine and the completion of a metals extraction facility, to be leased by IMC with an option to purchase, will serve the existing strategic direction of IMC, while expanding the geographic scope of its operations.\nAlthough Covid-19 and the completion of re-structuring requirements related to Assat LLC delayed the acquisition, IMC during that period continued to develop relationships in\nArmenia\nat national and local level and has developed a pipeline of other prospective projects which IMC hopes will come to fruition in the coming year.\nIMC continues with its gold and copper exploration programmes in\nSouth East Ireland\n. Copper is an important part of the green energy transition.\nIt is considered to be the most cost-effective conductive material.\nThe critical role copper will play in achieving the\nParis\nclimate goals cannot be overstated. IMC will be part of this new green transition and is in the enviable position of having the Avoca copper mine on its licence area.\nPrevious\nproduction from the Avoca Mine is estimated to have totalled 16Mt grading c. 0.6% Cu from banded, vein and disseminated sulphides hosted by the upper Ordovician Duncannon Group. The total in situ copper resource at Avoca is believed to have exceeded\n100Mt\nat 0.2% Cu (Sheppard, 2007).\nIn addition, IMC has a mineral-rich supply of spoils and tailings with a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) showing amongst other minerals,\n2.6k\ntonnes copper contained in the\n1.87m\ntonnes spoils and tailings that are above surface.\nGold is widely considered to be an alternative universal currency.\nIMC holds six prospecting licences in the southeast of\nIreland\nthat are highly prospective for gold mineralization.\nThree of these licences are within, or cover the strike extent of, the Avoca volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) mineralized belt in\nCo. Wicklow\n, an area having highly anomalous gold (Au) values in bedrock, soils and stream sediments.\nIMC has established an Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate of c. 20,000 ounces of gold and 600,000 oz\u2019s of silver on part of the spoils and tailings from the historic East Avoca Mine.\nIMC continues its exploration programme in conjunction with our collaboration partners\nTrinity College Dublin\nand are presently carrying out geological work on the ground in\nCo. Wicklow\n.\nFurthermore, the Irish government previously commissioned a feasibility study in regard to remediation of the Avoca spoils and tailings site which extends to c. 155 acres, and the European Commission also considers remediation of such sites to be a priority.\nIn that regard, and arising from meetings IMC has had with the China National Geological Mining Corporation (\u201cCGM\u201d) who have significant experience in remediation of such sites, IMC commissioned a drone survey of the Avoca site, and intends to put together a project to both extract metals from the spoils and tailings and to remediate the site.\nIMC\u2019s North Wexford gold project consists of three properties.\nTwo of these are prospective for gold and VMS mineralization, and an adjacent property is prospective for orogenic gold mineralization.\nThere is no doubt that this is an exciting time for IMC, particularly as our shareholders have ",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nIMC Reports Results from Further Three Drillholes at West Avoca\nDrillhole 21-3850-02 intercepted a\n4m\nwide zone grading 5.6% zinc and 2.1% lead (7.7% combined zinc + lead) between 143.5 and\n147.5m\n. Two further zones of massive and semi-massive sulphide mineralisation were intersected between\n252m\n(\n3.4m\nwide) and\n273m\n(\n2.5m\nwide). Drillhole 21-3850-03 encountered two zones of semi-massive sulphide (23.0\n-39.7m\nand 202.75 -\n211.7m\n). The lower zone assayed\n8.95m\nat 0.5% copper (including\n1.0m\ngrading 1.6% copper and\n0.95m\ngrading 1.2% copper). Associated with, but slightly deeper than, the lower zone is a\n7.05m\nsection grading 0.23 g/t gold. Drillhole 21-3850-04 encountered massive sulphide mineralisation from 172.8-\n187.0m\n. The\n3m\ninterval between 181.0-\n184.0m\ngraded 2.2% zinc + lead. Gold grades of up to 0.23 g/t over\n1m\nare present. Copper grades include 1.5% copper over a\n0.5m\ninterval and 0.3% copper over a\n4.0m\ninterval. Other zones of well-developed pyrite mineralisation occur throughout the sequence drilled. This drill programme, in conjunction with historical drill records, has confirmed Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Au mineralization over a minimum\nc.\n1000m\nstrike to the southwest from the mapped underground workings.\nIMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d), the\nLondon\n-listed exploration company based in\nIreland\n, is pleased to announce assay results from its second, third and fourth drillholes from a\n1,100m\ndrilling programme at its West Avoca property on PL 3850,\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n.\nThe drill programme focused on exploring the unmined, south-western extension of the Avoca Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag-Au deposit. Mineralisation has now been successfully traced over a strike length of\n300m\nbetween the first and fourth holes of this programme. Furthermore, historical drilling\n700m\nto the southwest of 21-3850-04 encountered\n3.0m\ngrading 0.7% Cu indicating that the mineralising system remains open. This represents a minimum strike length of\nc.\n1000m\n, most of which remains to be drill tested.\nDrillholes 21-3850-02 and -03 were drilled on the same section and represented a\n50m\nnorth-easterly step out from the previously reported 21-3850-01. The mineralised section in 21-3850-02 from 143.5-\n147.5m\n(\n4.0m\ngrading 7.7% zinc + lead) is interpreted as the along-strike and up-dip projection of the\n18.7m\nintercept grading 6.5% zinc + lead in 21-3850-01 (reported on 26th\nOctober 2021\n).\nDrillhole 21-3850-03 tested\n150m\ndowndip from the intercept in 21-3850-02 and encountered copper mineralisation suggestive of either metal variation along strike within the system or possible faulting to juxtapose the zinc-lead mineralised horizon with the deeper copper horizon. The section from 202.75-\n211.70m\ngraded\n8.95m\nat 0.5% copper. The\n7.05m\nbetween\n210.75m\n-\n217.8m\nanalysed 0.23g/t Au. From\n252m\n, drilling difficulties were encountered and the drill hole was not able to test the projected deepest copper horizon.\nDrillhole 21-3850-04 tested the mineralisation\nc.\n300m\nalong strike to the south=west of 21-3850-03. Extensive zones of sulphide mineralisation were encountered with the best zinc grades from 181.0-\n184.0m\n(\n3m\ngrading 2.2% zinc + lead) and copper grades from 206.0 \u2013\n210.0m\n(\n4m\ngrading 0.3% copper). A section from 240.3-\n240.8m\nassayed 1.5% copper. Grades of up to 0.23 g/t gold over a\n1m\ninterval are present.\nMinimal drilling has taken place to the south-west of 21-3850-04 but all indications are that the Avoca mineralising system remains open to the south-west.\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman, commented,\n\u2018The substantial amount of massive sulphide mineralisation encountered in these three drillholes, allied with historical drilling, support the interpretation that there is a minimum strike length of\n1,000m\nof exploration potential to the south-west of the mapped underground workings at West Avoca.\nGrades of up to 1.5% copper and 7.7% lead + zinc mineralisation encountered to the south-west of the old workings provide optimism that continuity of mineralisation and further economic grade intersections can be targeted in the West Avoca area.\nIMC will drill test and evaluate the\n700m\nunexplored section to the south-west of drillhole 21-3850-04 and further appraise the reported historical intercept of\n3m\ngrading 0.7% Cu to prove up the along-strike extent of the mineralising system.\nThis ",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nRESULTS FOR THE PERIOD 1st\nJULY 2021\nTO 31st\nDECEMBER 2021\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nThe Directors of IMC are pleased to present the Company\u2019s unaudited, consolidated, interim\u00a0financial results for the first six-month period of the current financial year to 31st\nDecember 2021\n.\nThe half-year under review was an extremely busy and positive time for the Company, with the drill programme in West Avoca commencing during this period. A drilling programme was undertaken to assess the extent and continuity of Cu,\u00a0Au, Pb, Zn mineralisation along strike from the historic Avoca mine. Historical mineralised intercepts in the West Avoca area include\n10m\ngrading 1.1% Cu and\n9m\ngrading 10.3% Zn and 4.8% Pb.\nIMC achieved exceptionally good intersects of\n18.7m\nof zinc, lead and silver mineralisation at West Avoca. We encountered four zones of massive and semi-massive sulphide mineralisation at depths between\n159m\nand\n206m\n. When aggregated over an\n18.7m\ninterval, the upper three zones assayed 6.5% zinc and lead and included\n2.8m\ngrading 12.6% zinc and lead and\n2.2m\ngrading 70g/t silver. Further drilling has both encountered massive and semi-massive sulphide mineralisation.\nThe Board of IMC is delighted that we have intersected\n18.7m\nof zinc, lead and silver mineralisation at West Avoca. Furthermore, it has confirmed the geological interpretation and emphasises the validity in reassessing and drill-testing historical deposits where significant mineralisation remains.\nThe Avoca Mine is estimated to have contained 16 million tonnes of 0.6% copper which was exported as a concentrate that contained \u2018payable grades of gold and silver\u2019 (Williams et al., 1986). In addition, in situ zinc and lead mineralisation is present at West Avoca over a minimum strike length of c.\n300m\n.\nFurther progress continues on our spoils\u2019 and tailings\u2019 project in\nCo. Wicklow\n, where we have established an Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate. Our successful collaboration with\nTrinity College Dublin, Ireland\ncontinues and we would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their valuable contributions.\nIMC previously announced that it had conditionally agreed to acquire MVI Ireland s.r.o., the 100% owner of the Assat company in\nArmenia\nwhich is the holder of the mining licence for the Karaberd gold mine located in\nLori Marz\n, northern\nArmenia\n. The conditional agreement remains in place and we expect to complete the acquisition during the coming period.\nThis is a propitious time for gold, silver, copper and zinc with the high commodity prices presently prevailing. The Directors look forward to reporting further results from the West Avoca drilling programme and on progress towards completion of the MVI Ireland s.r.o. acquisition.\nEamon O\u2019Brien,Executive Chairman,\nDublin\n, 28th\nFebruary 2022\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the period 31st\nJuly 2021\nto 31st\nDecember 2021\nContinuing Operations\nDec\u201921\nJun\u201921\nAdministrative expenses\n(57,586)\n(294,996)\nOperating Loss for the period\n(57,586)\n(294,996)\nFinance Income\n-\n-\nAmount written off Intangible Assets\n-\n(43,484)\nAmount written off investment\n-\n-\n__________\n__________\nLoss for period before tax\n(57,586)\n(338,480)\nIncome tax expenses\n-\n2,047\n_________\n_________\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(57,586)\n(336,433)\n=========\n=========\nLoss attributable to:\nEquity holders of the Company\n(57,586)\n(336,433)\n=========\n=========\nTotal Comprehensive Loss attributable to:\nEquity holders of the Company\n(57,586)\n(336,433)\n=========\n=========\nEarnings per share\nFrom continuing operations\nBasic and Diluted loss per share (cent)\n0.0\n0.1\nAll activities derived from continuing operations.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n.\nFINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 1ST\nJULY 2020\nTO 30TH\nJUNE 2021\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nChairman\u2019s Statement for the Year ended\n30 June 2021\nThe Directors of IMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) are pleased to present the audited financial results for IMC for the twelve months to 30th June 2021. The consolidated financial statements appearing below (which do not form the full statutory Report and Accounts of the Company) are taken from the Directors\u2019 Report and Financial Statements for the year ended\n30 June 2021\nposted to shareholders, a copy of which will be available from IMC\u2019s website at\nhttps://www.imcexploration.com/\n.\nThe last year has been a very eventful time for IMC, both on the corporate and exploration fronts. Further work on our spoils and tailings\u2019 project has been carried out. Additional trial pits were excavated proving greater depths than expected at West Avoca and indicating the presence of a larger tonnage of spoils and tailings than had originally been estimated in the CSA Global Report (2019). The gold assays from these trial pits combined with the expected increase in tonnage indicates the existing gold Exploration Target at West Avoca will represent further potential. Significantly elevated copper, lead and silver grades are also present.\nIMC will commission an update of the existing West Avoca Exploration Target with the objective of upgrading it to an Inferred Resource. This will complement the JORC-compliant CSA Global commissioned IMC Mineral Resource Estimate (\u2018MRE\u2019) on East Avoca where an inferred resource of ca. 20,000 gold oz. was reported.\nFurther, gold mineralisation was confirmed in appraisal drilling at North Wexford. Zones of gold mineralisation were present throughout rhyolites. During appraisal drilling on its North Wexford gold project, IMC intersected a\n47m\nmineralised acid volcanic horizon (mainly rhyolites) at depths up to\n50m\ndeeper than historical drilling. Gold mineralisation occurred over five closely-spaced intervals (ranging from 0.9 \u2013\n1.4m\nwide) with a maximum grade of 0.4 g/t Au over a\n1m\ninterval.\nThese grades are in line with those reported previously from historic drill hole GQ1, 0.5 g/t Au over\n18.6m\n. The alteration associated with the rhyolites is extensive and indicative of a strong mineralising system that is prospective for both gold and base metals. Rocks intersected also confirmed base metal potential.\nThe drilling results from our North Wexford licence reinforces the highly prospective geology of IMC\u2019s licences in this area and supports IMC\u2019s strategy of understanding the gold mineralisation with the objective of establishing a gold resource.\nWith copper prices recently reaching an all-time high, climate change initiatives to the fore and copper a vital component to drive the green economy, IMC will be part of this new, green future with its copper project in Avoca. IMC\u2019s Avoca licence area in\nCo. Wicklow\ncontains the historic Avoca copper mine. This mine is estimated to have contained 16 million tonnes of 0.6% copper which was exported as a concentrate that contained \u201dpayable grades of gold and silver\u201d (Williams et al., 1986). In addition,\nin situ\nzinc and lead mineralisation is present at West Avoca over a minimum strike length of\nca.\n300m.\nWhen this mine ceased operations in 1982, (owing mainly to the low price of copper prevailing at that time) significant amounts of ore were left in place. IMC has reassessed historical records along strike to the south-west from the Avoca mine, and interprets there to be a 1.2 km minimum strike length that has either been only partially tested or else has specific targets remaining to be drill tested.\nAt the north-eastern end of the 1.2 km strike length outlined by IMC, historical drilling encountered\n13.3m\ngrading 3.7% Zn, 1.8% Pb and\n5.3m\ngrading 1.9% Cu. At the south-western end, historical assays include\n5.8m\ngrading 0.5% Cu with\n0.9m\ngrading 0.5 g/t Au. Widely-spaced drillholes within the 1.2km strike extent have assayed\n10m\ngrading 1.1% Cu and\n9.0m\ngrading 10.25% Zn and 4.78% Pb. Gold grades of up to 0.4 g/t Au over\n4.5m\nhave been recorded and represent a highly positive \u2018credit\u2019 when taken in consideration with the high copper and zinc grades.\nIMC is currently drilling in West Avoca adjoining the historic Avoca Copper mine.

Wicklow\nIMC Intersects Zinc, Lead and Copper Mineralisation in First Drillhole at West Avoca\nThe initial drillhole, 21-3850-01, has encountered four zones of massive and semi-massive sulphide. Over\n75m\nof drill core is being split for assay. Three further drill holes are planned to assess the extent and continuity of Cu, Au, Zn, Pb mineralisation along strike from the historic Avoca mine. Historical mineralised intercepts in the West Avoca area include\n10m\ngrading 1.1% Cu and\n9m\ngrading 10.3% Zn and 4.8% Pb. IMC plans that the drill programme will allow an independent resource calculation to be undertaken. in addition to that already in place for the spoils\u2019 and tailings\u2019 project.\nIMC Exploration Group plc (IMC), the\nLondon\n-listed exploration company based in\nIreland\n, is pleased to announce the completion of its first drillhole in a\n1,000m\ndrilling programme at its West Avoca property on PL 3850,\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n.\nDrill hole 21-3850-01 has extended the down dip extent of mineralisation and has encountered zinc-lead and copper-gold mineralization as interpreted.\nA total of four massive and semi-massive sulphide zones were encountered between depths of\n159m\nand\n226m\nrepresenting individual heavily mineralised intervals of 1.85, 5.3, 5.0 and\n4.9m\nrespectively. The upper three zones are zinc dominant and the lower zone copper dominant. Over\n75m\nof drill core has been split and sent to ALS Laboratories in\nCo. Galway\nfor analyses.\nDrill hole 21-3850-01 represents a down dip step out of\n40m\nfrom the nearest historical drillhole which assayed\n9m\ngrading 10.3% Zn and 4.8% Pb. The (upper) zinc-lead mineralized horizon now has an extrapolated minimum dip extent of\n75m\n(supported by three drillholes) and remains open both up and down dip and along strike to the southwest.\nMany previous drillholes in this part of West Avoca had not drilled deep enough to test presence of a copper-gold zone underlying the zinc-lead zone. The\n4.9m\n(lower) copper zone intersected in 21-3850-01 confirms the copper potential of the West Avoca area.\nBackground\nThe Avoca Mine is estimated to have contained 16 million tonnes of 0.6% copper which was exported as a concentrate that contained \u2018payable grades of gold and silver\u2019 (Williams et al., 1986). In addition,\nin situ\nzinc and lead mineralisation is present at West Avoca over a minimum strike length of\nc.\n300m\n.\nWhen the Avoca mine ceased operation in 1982 (owing mainly to the low price of copper prevailing at that time) significant amounts of ore were left in place. With the copper price recently at an all-time high, IMC has reassessed historical records along strike to the southwest from the Avoca mine, and interprets there to be a 1.2 km minimum strike length that has either been only partially tested or else has specific targets remaining to be drill tested.\nAt the north-eastern end of the 1.2 km strike length outlined by IMC, historical drilling encountered\n13.3m\ngrading 3.7% Zn 1.8% Pb and\n5.3m\ngrading 1.9% Cu. At the southwestern end, historical assays include\n5.8m\ngrading 0.5% Cu with\n0.9m\ngrading 0.5 g/t Au. Widely-spaced drillholes within the 1.2km strike extent have assayed\n10m\ngrading 1.1% Cu and\n9.0m\ngrading 10.25% Zn and 4.78% Pb. Gold grades of up to 0.4 g/t Au over\n4.5m\nhave been recorded and represent a highly positive \u2018credit\u2019 when taken in consideration with the high copper and zinc grades.\nIn the West Avoca area, zinc-lead mineralisation overlies copper-gold mineralisation. Much of the historical drilling has not tested the deeper (\nc.\n200m\ndepth) copper-gold mineralisation. This programme is planned to test the down dip extent of the zinc-lead mineralisation and assess the mostly untested underlying copper-gold mineralisation.\nIMC has reported JORC-compliant figures of\nc.\n20,000 ozs of gold,\n2.6k\ntonnes of copper and\n7.8k\ntonnes of lead from mine spoils and tailings to the northeast of the planned drilling (8th\nSeptember 2020\n).\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman, commented:\n\u2018The first drill hole in the\n1,000m\ndrill programme has validated and extended zones of mineralisation encountered in historical exploration which tested part of the unmined zones of mineralisation.

With the copper price recently at an all-time high, IMC has reassessed historical records along strike to the southwest from the Avoca mine, and interprets there is a 1.2km minimum strike length that has either been only partially tested or else has specific targets remaining to be drill tested.\nAt the north-eastern end of the 1.2km strike length outlined by IMC, historical drilling encountered\n13.3m\ngrading 3.7% Zn 1.8% Pb and\n5.3m\ngrading 1.9% Cu. At the south-western end, historical assays include\n5.8m\ngrading 0.5% Cu with\n0.9m\ngrading 0.5 g/t Au. Widely spaced drillholes within the 1.2km strike extent have assayed\n10m\ngrading 1.1% Cu and\n9.0m\ngrading 10.25% Zn and 4.78% Pb. Gold grades of up to 0.4 g/t Au over\n4.5m\nhave been recorded and represent a highly positive \u2018credit\u2019 when taken in consideration with the high copper and zinc grades.\nIn the West Avoca area, zinc-lead mineralization overlies copper-gold mineralization. Much of the historical drilling has not tested the deeper (\nc.\n200m\ndepth) copper-gold mineralization. This programme is planned to test the down dip extent of the zinc-lead mineralization and assess the mostly untested underlying copper-gold mineralization.\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman, commented: \u2018This drill programme is designed to validate and extend zones of mineralization encountered in historical exploration which left unmined zones of mineralization. The substantive historical intercepts and strike length identified, allied with this planned drilling, will allow IMC to move towards a bedrock resource calculation to complement existing JORC-compliant spoils and tailings calculations. With copper prices recently reaching an all-time high, climate change initiatives to the fore and copper a vital component to drive the green economy, IMC will be part of this new green future with its copper project in Avoca.\u2019\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulting geologist and a Competent Person as described in the JORC 2012 reporting code.\n2) Further to Announcement of 15th\nApril 2021\nre.

On 7th\nSeptember 2020\n, I was able to announce that the Company had raised \u00a3267,500 before transaction expenses by means of a placing of 26,750.000 new ordinary shares.\nWith our spoils and tailings project in\nCo. Wicklow\n, our on-going collaboration with\nTrinity College Dublin, Ireland\nand our appraisal drilling on our North Wexford Gold Project, we continue to make significant progress.\nTrial pits were excavated proving greater depths and densities than expected at West Avoca, indicating the presence of a larger tonnage of spoils and tailings than had originally been estimated in the CSA Global Report of 2019. The gold assays from the trial pits, combined with the expected increase in tonnage, imply that the existing gold Exploration Target at West Avoca is likely to have been underestimated. Significantly elevated copper, lead and silver grades are also present.\nWe continue to work closely with our collaborative partners,\nTrinity College Dublin\n, on a number of developments including clarifying and understanding the paragenesis of gold at IMC\u2019s Avoca VMS deposit.\nThe last six months have been extremely productive and positive for IMC and we are confident that the balance of the current financial year will bring further progress for the benefit of shareholders.\nPost- Balance Sheet Developments\nThe preliminary drilling information from our recent drilling on our North Wexford Gold Project, updates on which were issued to the market on 28th January and 23rd\nFebruary 2021\n, reinforces the highly prospective geology and supports IMC\u2019s strategy of understanding the gold mineralisation with the objective of establishing another gold resource. In addition, IMC is commissioning an update of the existing West Avoca Exploration Target with the objective of upgrading this to an Inferred Resource.\nI look forward to being able to report further news on our spoils and tailings project at Avoca,\nCo.

Gold mineralisation occurs over five closely-spaced intervals (ranging from 0.9 \u2013\n1.4m\nwide) with a maximum grade of 0.4 g/t Au over a\n1m\ninterval.\nThese grades are in line with those reported previously from historic drill hole GQ1 (reported 19th\nNovember 2020\n; 0.5 g/t Au over\n18.6m\n). The alteration associated with the rhyolites is extensive and indicative of a strong mineralising system that is prospective for both gold and base metals.\nThe acid volcanic package tested by both GQ1 and 20-1200-01 is one of three similar geological horizons that traverse PL 1200. Historical geochemical sampling has proved elevated gold values spatially associated with all three horizons. In total, there is a strike length of\ncirca\n9km of highly prospective rock types on the licence. Furthermore, IMC operates both the adjoining licence to the southeast (PL 1199), which has the strike continuation of the same geology as PL 1200, and the highly prospective licence to the northwest (PL 2551), where IMC reported gold grades of 354 g/t Au over a\n1.5m\nwidth in drilling at Boley.\nChairman\nEamon O\u2019Brien\ncommented, \u201cIMC\u2019s drilling information from PL 1200 confirms the mineralisation potential of the North Wexford area as indicated in IMC\u2019s 28th\nJanuary 2021\nannouncement.

Wicklow, Ireland\nHighlights\nTrial pits were excavated proving greater depths than expected at West Avoca, indicating the presence of a larger tonnage of spoils and tailings than was originally estimated in the CSA Global Report (2019).\nThe gold assays from the trial pits combined with the expected increase in tonnage implies the existing gold Exploration Target at West Avoca is likely to represent an underestimate. Significantly elevated copper, lead and silver grades are also present.\nFurthermore, IMC will commission an update of the existing West Avoca Exploration Target with the objective of upgrading it to an Inferred Resource.\nIMC Exploration Group Plc (IMC), the\nLondon\n-listed gold explorer in\nIreland\n, is pleased to report initial results based upon recent further exploration work carried out on the West Avoca spoil and tailing heaps.\nAfter a series of trial pits excavated across the Ballymurtagh spoil heaps in West Avoca, potential additional tonnage has been discovered as depths of spoil were greater than had previously been estimated.\nOne sample taken vertically across a metre interval within a spoil heap returned grades of 1.14 g/t Au and 0.27% Cu. This reinforces the potential for significantly elevated gold grades to occur within the spoil heaps.\nIn addition to the spoil heap tonnage, other trial pits also discovered a larger area of mine tailings contained within the north lode pit than had previously been calculated. These tailings also contain significant grades of gold and copper.\nIMC will immediately commission studies on the West Avoca Exploration Target with the objective of allowing upgrading to an Inferred Resource category.\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulting geologist and a Competent Person as described in the JORC 2012 reporting code.\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman of IMC, commented, \u201c\nThis is an important result. With the existing Exploration Target in West Avoca planned to be upgraded to an Inferred Resource, this will complement the JORC compliant CSA Global Mineral Resource Estimate on East Avoca where an Inferred Resource of circa 20,000 oz gold was previously reported. IMC will immediately commence the process of upgrading and expanding the 2019 MRE to include these encouraging results in accordance with the JORC Code (2012).\u201d\nDublin\n, 10th\u00a0December 2020\nThe foregoing announcement has been issued after due and careful enquiry and the Directors of IMC take responsibility for the content.\nREGULATORY ANNOUNCEMENT ENDS.\nEnquiries\n:\nKeith, Bayley, Rogers & Co.

Historical work had encountered an intercepted grade of 0.5 g/t Au over\n18.6m\n, as was announced on 13th\nOctober 2020\nunder the headline \u201cDrilling Report; New Appraisal Programme in N. Wexford\u201d informing the market of the\npermitting of appraisal drilling\non the North Wexford licence area. IMC targeted its appraisal drilling to intersect the mineralised zone at greater depth than the historical drilling and encountered disseminated and vein pyrite mineralisation and alteration indicative of a strong mineralising system. Logging and sampling of the core are ongoing. This new data confirms and expands on that outlined previously, and can be reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012).\nTwelve trial pits were excavated at West Avoca and sampling is now complete.

ON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VIA A REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE (\"RIS\"), THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nFINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 1ST\nJULY 2019\nTO 30TH\nJUNE 2020\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nChairman\u2019s Statement for the year ended 30th\nJune 2020\nThe Directors of IMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) are pleased to present the audited financial results for IMC for the twelve months to 30th June 2020. The consolidated financial statements appearing below (which do not form the full statutory Report and Accounts of the Company) are taken from the Directors\u2019 Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30th\nJune 2020\nposted to shareholders, a copy of which is available from IMC\u2019s website at\nhttps://www.imcexploration.com/\n.\nDuring the year the CSA Global commissioned IMC Mineral Resource Estimate (\u2018MRE\u2019) on our Avoca spoils and tailings project located in\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\nwas published. This JORC-compliant MRE report shows, inter alia, significant grades of extracted and crushed gold (1,871,000t at 0.3g/t Au), copper (1,871,000t at 0.14% Cu) and lead (1,871,000t at 0.42% Pb) in the spoil heaps on the East Avoca section of the site.\nThis MRE for our spoils and tailings project is significant, with the gold estimate alone at circa 20,000oz. Furthermore, the Company has recently identified exploration targets at West Avoca where there is further potential to increase this estimate by up to 4,000oz gold within the Avoca area. This additional work has commenced.\nIMC is also pleased to report there have been major developments in its North Wexford Gold Project which gives us immediate capacity and scope to accelerate our exploration programme here. An initial review of historical exploration on the recently acquired PL 1200 in\nCo. Wexford\nis progressing, and is part of a group of three licences held by IMC that are underlain by the mineralized rhyolitic volcanic rocks of South East Leinster.\nSome years ago, RioFinEx drilled a gold-in-soil anomaly on PL 1200 and proved gold mineralisation hosted by highly altered rocks at a depth of\n30m\n.\u00a0Groove sampling of the drill core proved an intercepted grade of 0.5 g/t Au over\n18.6m\n(weighted average over 3 to\n3.6m\nintervals). Half core sampling of part of the groove sampled interval assayed\n15m\nat 0.2 g/t Au (weighted average of\n1.5m\nintervals). Although all the pertinent data is available for examination and extrapolation, IMC intends to drill further in this area in order to confirm and expand on the data available to the Company in accordance with the JORC Code (2012).\nThis aligns with IMC\u2019s strategy of establishing a gold resource on its three North Wexford prospecting licences. The additional licences in Wexford, along with the high gold grades already encountered on parts of the adjoining IMC licence PL 2551, gives the company the ability to action its exploration and geological work in this area.\nDuring the year IMC entered into a collaboration with the Raw Materials Research Group at\nTrinity College Dublin\n. IMC\u2019s Board believes access to this world-class micro-analytical facility is a tremendous advantage for IMC and its Avoca properties. We are now working with them on petrographic and microanalytical work on samples from IMC drill-holes targeting the gold-rich Kilmacoo zone. This strategic partnership has the potential significantly to enhance the gold resource at Avoca.\nOur strategy is clear. We are focused on upgrading our spoils and tailings project at Avoca; gaining maximum advantage from our collaboration with\nTrinity College\n; and bringing our resources on our North Wexford gold project licence area to JORC-compliant standards.\nAs you are no doubt aware the price of gold has recently reached an all-time high of over\n$2,000\nper oz.\u00a0This, and the exciting developments outlined above, represent an unprecedented time for gold and, in turn, your Company.\nEamon O\u2019Brien,Chairman\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Incomefor the year ended 30th\nJune 2020\nContinuing Operations\n2020 (\u20ac)\n2019 (\u20ac)\nAdministrative expenses\n(251,947)\n(366,816)\nOperating Loss for the period\n(251,947)\n(366,816)\nFinance Income\n-\n-\nAmount written off Intangible Assets\nAmount written off investment\n-\n-\n__________\n__________\nLoss for period before tax\n(251,947)\n(366,816)\nIncome tax expenses\n-\n(2,047)\n_________\n_________\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(251,947)\n(368,863)\n=========\n=========\nLoss attributable to:\nEquity holders of the Company\n(251,947)\n(368,863)\n===",

Groove sampling of the drill core at that time proved an intercepted grade of 0.5 g/t Au over\n18.6m\n(weighted average over 3 to\n3.6m\nintervals and included intervals of\n3m\ngrading 0.8 g/t Au and\n3.6m\ngrading 0.7 g/t Au). Half core sampling of part of the groove sampled interval assayed\n15m\nat 0.2 g/t Au (weighted average of\n1.5m\nintervals).\nAlthough all the pertinent data is available for examination, IMC has determined that the overall data set is not JORC compliant. IMC therefore intends to drill further in this area in order to confirm and expand on the data available to the Company in accordance with the JORC Code (2012).\nThe geological setting, gold grades and alteration within the rhyolite host rocks in PL 1200 are comparable with other copper-gold deposits associated with the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. Specifically, there are geological similarities with the Avoca deposits to the North East and the Parys Mountain deposit on Anglesey.\nIMC continues to assess the historical records available for PL 1200 and has concluded from geochemical and geophysical data that other areas within PL 1200 remain to be drill tested.\nIMC recently acquired licenses PL 1200 and PL 1199, adjacent to PL 2551. Previously in PL 2551, IMC drilled a \u201cbonanza grade\u201d gold anomaly at Boley with a\n1.5m\ninterval grading 354 g/t Au and a\n13.5m\ninterval averaging 3.5 g/t Au (applying 20 g/t top cut). Further notable drill intercepts in PL 2551 include\n0.72m\ngrading 10 g/t Au;\n1.3m\ngrading 3.8 g/t Au;\n1.2m\ngrading 8.3 g/t Au and\n5m\ngrading 2.4 g/t Au. IMC believes that the two new licences will significantly enhance the Company\u2019s North Wexford gold project.\nChairman\nEamon O\u2019Brien\ncommented, \u2018IMC has a strategic interest in the volcanic rocks of South East Leinster and our assessment of historical information in PL 1200, which had only one shallow hole drilled in the past 34 years, proves that quality exploration targets remain to be tested. This is consistent with IMC\u2019s strategy to establish a significant gold resource. The additional licences in\nIreland\n, along with the high gold grades already encountered on parts of the adjoining IMC licence PL 2551, give the Company the immediate capacity to accelerate its exploration programme in this area.\u2019\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulting geologist and a Competent Person as described in the JORC 2012 reporting code.\nEamon P. O\u2019Brien,Executive Chairman,\nDublin\n, 17th\nSeptember 2020\nThe Directors of IMC, after due and careful enquiry, accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nREGULATORY ANNOUNCEMENT ENDS.\nContact Details:\nKeith, Bayley, Rogers & Co.

Exploration Target in West Avoca estimated at 3,500-4,000 oz gold. Sampling planned to upgrade West Avoca Exploration Target to Inferred Resource. Inferred Resource of 19,800 oz gold previously reported for East Avoca.\nIntroduction\nIMC Exploration Group Plc (IMC), the\nLondon\n-listed gold and base metals explorer in\nIreland\n, is pleased to report the following update based upon a reassessment of tonnages contained in the West Avoca spoil heaps.\nIMC commissioned Trove Metal Ltd (Trove) to review the tonnages contained in the mineralized spoils of the West Avoca Exploration Target as described by CSA Global (CSA) in the 2019 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) report on the Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\n(reported 11th September 2019). The 2020 Trove report considers the West Avoca Exploration Target in isolation. This is in addition to the CSA MRE report for East Avoca (Inferred Resource of 19,800oz gold).\nTrove has entered into an agreement with IMC to establish an environmental clean-up operation to remove metals from the existing mine waste at the Avoca site.\nIMC plans to carry out further sampling on the West Avoca Exploration Target in 2020 to allow an Inferred Resource to be calculated at West Avoca*.\nThe 2020 Trove Report\nThe 2020 Trove report reassessed and recalculated the likely tonnes contained in five defined areas of West Avoca, four of which are represented by surface spoils (S1-4) and one area of backfilled spoils (U1).\nThe CSA Exploration Target tonnage estimate for the West Avoca spoils specified a range from 130,000 to 180,000 tonnes. The 2020 Trove report, with areas and topography of the spoil heaps better defined through detailed assessment of lidar measurements, has calculated that 385,042 tonnes are present. The depth measurements of the spoils are based on conservative estimates of the vertical extent of each stockpile and range from\n2.0m\nto\n4.7m\n. A tonnage factor of 1.6 was used.\nStockpile\nArea (m2)\nVolume (m3)\nTonnes\nS1\n6,483\n30,800\n49,280\nS2\n5,008\n20,031\n32,049\nS3\n4,279\n17,116\n27,386\nS4\n19,918\n59,754\n95,606\nU1\n56,475\n112,950\n180,721\nTotal\n92,163\n240,652\n385,042\nTable 1.

The results are tabulated below.\nStockpile\nSample ID\nAu g/t\nAg g/t\nS1\nWA 02\n0.51\n4.2\nS2\nWA 01\n0.33\n3.5\nS3\nWA 04\n0.35\n8.0\nS4\nWA 03\n0.27\n6.9\nU1\nNot Sampled\nTable 2. Grab sampling at West Avoca (Trove Metal Ltd).\nCSA provide a grade range of 0.3 \u2013 0.6 g/t Au for the West Avoca spoil heaps Exploration Target. Using the lower estimate of 0.3 g/t Au (which is also the grade of the JORC-compliant CSA MRE in East Avoca) an Exploration Target in the region of 3,500-4,000 oz Au is reasonable for West Avoca using the updated tonnage estimate in the 2020 Trove report.\nThese re-estimated values for the number of tonnes likely to be present (and associated gold content) will benefit from more detailed exploration, specifically detailed sampling at regular lateral and vertical intervals to firm-up the Exploration Target into an Inferred Resource.\n*As an Exploration Target under the JORC (2012) code the estimates for West Avoca contained in the Trove report cannot be included as a resource as the potential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, and that there has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource.\nThe CSA MRE\nIn\nSeptember 2019\n, IMC published an MRE on its Avoca Historic Mine Site Project,\nIreland\nspoils and tailings project located in\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n. The JORC-compliant MRE report shows, inter alia, significant grades of extracted and crushed gold (1,871,000t at 0.3g/t Au), copper (1,871,000t at 0.14% Cu) and lead (1,871,000t at 0.42% Pb) in the spoil heaps on the East Avoca part of the site.\nMineralogical testing is ongoing, and it is also anticipated that this will confirm that a sizeable quantity of gold and metals will be recoverable at low cost, given that the material has already been extracted and crushed. IMC, Trove and CSA believe there are reasonable prospects for the eventual economic extraction of the Mineral Resources.\nThis release has been approved by EurGeol Professor Garth Earls PGeo, FSEG, who is an independent consulti",

ON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT\nVIA\nA REGULATORY INFORMATION SERVICE (\"RIS\"), THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nIMC Exploration Group plc (\u201cIMC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nPlacing of Shares\nPlacing of New and Treasury Shares\nThe Board of IMC is pleased to announce that the Company has raised \u00a3267,500 (two hundred and sixty-seven thousand\nfive hundred pounds Sterling\n) before expenses by way of an oversubscribed placing (the \u201cPlacing\u201d) of 26,750,000 (twenty six million seven hundred and fifty thousand) new ordinary shares of \u20ac0.001 each (\"Shares\") in the Company at a price of 1p per Share (one penny Sterling) for cash (the \u201cPlacing Shares\u201d), conditional only upon admission of the new Placing Shares to the Official List of the FCA and to trading on the regulated market of the London Stock Exchange (\u201cAdmission\u201d) of the new Placing Shares. Alongside each Placing Share will be issued a warrant to subscribe for one further Share at a price of 2 p (\ntwo pence\nSterling) per Share, exercisable for one year from the date of issue (the \u201cWarrants\u201d). No application shall be made for admission to any list or to trading on any market (regulated or otherwise) of the Warrants.\nFurther to the announcement made by IMC on\n5th August 2019\n, 3,250,000 (three million two hundred and fifty thousand) existing IMC shares were returned to the Company and had been held temporarily as treasury shares by IMC, pending re-sale for cash. These 3,250,000 shares, which had been allotted but for which no consideration had been received by the Company, have now been placed on the same terms as the Placing Shares, resulting in IMC\u2019s receiving a further \u00a332,500 (thirty-two thousand\nfive hundred pounds Sterling\n) before expenses.\nIncrease in Voting Rights Outstanding\nThe total number of voting rights in issue following the allotment of the Placing Shares shall be 311,495,991 (previously, 284,745,991). This new total is the denominator which shareholders should use to determine whether they are obliged to notify IMC of an interest in (or of a change to a notifiable interest in) voting rights. Application is being made for Admission for 26,750,000 Placing Shares.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will be applied for general working capital purposes but, in particular, for the further advancement of IMC\u2019s exploration and geological work on its spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow, Ireland\n, and to extend the significant progress already made on IMC\u2019s collaboration with\nTrinity College Dublin\n. Further, IMC will work closely with the Geological Survey of\nIreland\nto continue with the exploration work on IMC\u2019s North Wexford gold project.\nConclusion\nEamon O\u2019Brien, Chairman stated: \u201cWe are pleased to see significant support from new and existing investors. With the price having recently reached an all-time high of\n$2,000\nper troy ounce, this is an auspicious time for gold and, in particular, for IMC with its exciting gold projects in\nSouth East Ireland\n. The Company will move to accelerate progress at the spoils and tailings project in Avoca,\nCo. Wicklow\nand will provide independently-verified updates as they become available.\u201d\nEamon P.

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

Overall is as expected and does tidy up the open question for processing the ore ahead of the Armenian plant being built with that other non-Russian refinery.  I expect this year to be another where the company is building up it's foundations, hopefully the updated MRE in Ireland, dual listing and refinery contract to process more of the ore.  All whilst the POG has increased by $300 since the last update. All very positive",

This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast.

There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

So \u00a3150m, by 10, is give or take, \u00a315m of revenue coming in per year from the gold sales (ignoring AISC etc...) On that alone, that's annual revenue of 3x todays MCap!! Then throw in that the company will build and own a refinery in Armenia as well as the tailings on the surface in Ireland, Avoca mine potential. .... Still think this is undervalued IMO :)",

Notable drill intercepts at PL 2551 of 0.72m @ 10g/t Au; 1.3m @ 3.81 g/t Au; 1.2m @8.3 g/t Au and 5m @ 2.4 g/t Au.  IMC believes that the two new licences should significantly enhance the Company\u2019s North Wexford gold project. In our February 2018 Competent Person\u2019s report, the author, SLR, stated that in their opinion IMC\u2019s work has significantly upgraded the gold potential of the licence.

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

Overall is as expected and does tidy up the open question for processing the ore ahead of the Armenian plant being built with that other non-Russian refinery.  I expect this year to be another where the company is building up it's foundations, hopefully the updated MRE in Ireland, dual listing and refinery contract to process more of the ore.  All whilst the POG has increased by $300 since the last update. All very positive",

This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast.

There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

I expect this year to be another where the company is building up it's foundations, hopefully the updated MRE in Ireland, dual listing and refinery contract to process more of the ore.

This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast. This company is a textbook John Kaiser's bottom fish play.",

The sanctions did cause a ripple, but then at the same time the price of gold took off for when the ore is now being processed... There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer. At least at that point we'll start to be able to figure out an AISC too",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

Notable drill intercepts at PL 2551 of 0.72m @ 10g/t Au; 1.3m @ 3.81 g/t Au; 1.2m @8.3 g/t Au and 5m @ 2.4 g/t Au.  IMC believes that the two new licences should significantly enhance the Company\u2019s North Wexford gold project. In our February 2018 Competent Person\u2019s report, the author, SLR, stated that in their opinion IMC\u2019s work has significantly upgraded the gold potential of the licence. It is considered that there is strong support for the presence of a zone of major gold mineralization trending NE to ENE through the townlands of Boley, Ballygarret and Kilmichael.",

Last week, he increased his holding to 11%. Now, the suspense begins. Why did Dr. Cooley increase his stake at the last minute? Clearly, there's a plan to be executed here by him and others he's currently working with. \u2b50 Dr. Graham Cooley holds appointments at 2 active companies. The combined cash at bank value for all businesses where Graham holds a current appointment equals \u00a32m, with a combined total current assets value of \u00a35m. \u2b50 Interesting Facts: Dr. Graham Cooley successfully led ITM Power as Chief Executive Officer from 2009 to 2022. ITM Power was the first hydrogen-related company to be listed on the London Stock Market. \u2b50 Graham's Legacy: Graham joined the company in 2009 following a career in the power and technology sectors where he developed a number of novel technologies and oversaw multi-million-pound fundraising rounds. As CEO of ITM Power, he has broken the company into new markets \u2013 including Japan and North America \u2013 forged ground-breaking industrial partnerships, and overseen equity fundraisers of almost \u00a3500 million. The company has rapidly evolved and, in 2021, opened the world\u2019s largest electrolyser manufacturing facility.",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

The sanctions did cause a ripple, but then at the same time the price of gold took off for when the ore is now being processed... There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer. At least at that point we'll start to be able to figure out an AISC too",

It's not by chance if MVI has just convert their debt into equity. They know the repricing is imminent. This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast. This company is a textbook John Kaiser's bottom fish play.",

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company\n(\"IMC\" or the \"Company\")\nIMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company announces the successful renewal of its mining licence to Assat LLC, IMC's 100% owned subsidiary, for the Karaberd Mine, located in Lori Marz province, Republic of Armenia,\nIMC is delighted to announce the renewal of its mining licence to Assat LLC, IMC's 100% owned subsidiary, for the Karaberd Mine, located in Lori Marz province Republic of Armenia.\nThe licence has been renewed for a period of 9 (nine) years until 1\nst\nJanuary 2035.\nThe renewed licence provides for underground extraction of 30,000 tons of ore per annum and a requirement to submit a reserve revaluation report to the authorized body two years after receiving the right to use the subsoil, which should also include the reserves available in the open pit.\nUnder the renewed Licence Assat LLC has a right to extract up to 1,274 kg of gold and 2,310 kg of silver.\nThe renewal was awarded by the Minister for Territorial Administration and Infrastructures of the Republic of Armenia by way of amendments to the original licence\nNO.\nt\nU@-29/366.\nThe extended tenure of the licence to 2035 secures the long-term future of the mine and enables the systematic extraction of the ore that will be processed to extract Gold and Silver.\nChairman, Eamon O'Brien commented\n\"I am extremely pleased and happy for IMC, for our shareholders,\nincluding\nour major shareholder Mineral Ventures Invest s.r.o. and its CEO David Marasek who have provided steadfast support to IMC since the Karaberd mine acquisition, for our new Assat LLC CEO, Armand Pinarbasi, who along with our staff and corporate, legal and geological advisers achieved this major milestone.\nAfter IMC first achieved its full listing on the main market of the LSE, its first target acquisition was to acquire the Karaberd mine and while we have had lengthy and varied issues to navigate along the way, as explained in previous announcements, the renewal of the Karaberd mine licence could not have come at a better time when Gold and Silver have hit record prices per Oz having recently surpassed $5,000 Au and $100 Ag respectively.\nThe renewal that went through a very rigorous regulatory assessment, including through the Armenian Minister for Environment and four public hearings, also confirms the Company's good standing with the Armenian regulatory authorities\".\nOther Information\nAt this time, it is also worth noting that the Competent Persons Report update for the minerals deposit, dated 26th June 2023 for the Karaberd mine, as prepared by AMC Consultants of Perth, Australia for the purposes of assessing the approval by IMC shareholders of the Karaberd mine related acquisition, in October 2023, was set out as follows:\nMineral Resource Estimate Table showing Indicated and Inferred\nProduction\nASSAT LLC is currently finalising agreements in relation to ore enrichment and production of concentrate from its ore and then further processing of that concentrate to final 999 gold and silver products.\nUpdates will be provided on the finalisation of these agreements.\nArmenian Stock Exchange Dual Listing\nArmand Pinarbasi, the new IMC Board business development director\n(\nhttps://www.imcexploration.com/corporate/board-of-directors\n), commented\n\"following the successful renewal of the Karaberd Mining licence, and with the advantage of a current strong Gold and Silver price, IMC is now well placed to progress this added listing. This listing will enhance local liquidity and further strengthen the Company's standing within the Armenian capital markets\".\nEamon P. O'Brien,\nExecutive Chairman,\nDublin, 26th January 2026\nThe Directors of IMC Exploration Group Public Limited Company, after due and careful enquiry, accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nREGULATORY ANNOUNCEMENT ENDS.\nEnquiries\nIMC Exploration Group plc\nEamon O'Brien\neamon.obrien@imcexploration.com\n+353 87 6183024\nKathryn Byrne+353 85 233 6033\nKeith, Bayley, Rogers & Co.

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

So \u00a3150m, by 10, is give or take, \u00a315m of revenue coming in per year from the gold sales (ignoring AISC etc...) On that alone, that's annual revenue of 3x todays MCap!! Then throw in that the company will build and own a refinery in Armenia as well as the tailings on the surface in Ireland, Avoca mine potential. .... Still think this is undervalued IMO :)",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer. At least at that point we'll start to be able to figure out an AISC too",

This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast.

As far as I am aware, mine wise they are still digging and storing the ore, so at the moment likely working with capital on delayed income from that. Details are in the last half year report RNS.",

Overall is as expected and does tidy up the open question for processing the ore ahead of the Armenian plant being built with that other non-Russian refinery.  I expect this year to be another where the company is building up it's foundations, hopefully the updated MRE in Ireland, dual listing and refinery contract to process more of the ore.  All whilst the POG has increased by $300 since the last update. All very positive",

The reason is the extension of the mine being released and the muted reaction as well as the previous annual/half year report, where we can see the production starting and things coming together...  Check out what the share price did at those dates. (Hint, stayed stable). So I think that this is a very overdue correction.

Especially the tailings, which would have a super low AISC per tonne as they're on the surface.",

I'm hoping for there to be continued positive news as well as the anticipation of a dual listing in Armenia. I feel it will take the latter for a breakout because a dual listing can still only access the same shares as here... And I don't think there are many shares outside LTH hands",

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

So \u00a3150m, by 10, is give or take, \u00a315m of revenue coming in per year from the gold sales (ignoring AISC etc...) On that alone, that's annual revenue of 3x todays MCap!! Then throw in that the company will build and own a refinery in Armenia as well as the tailings on the surface in Ireland, Avoca mine potential. .... Still think this is undervalued IMO :)",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer.

This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast.

As far as I am aware, mine wise they are still digging and storing the ore, so at the moment likely working with capital on delayed income from that. Details are in the last half year report RNS.",

I expect this year to be another where the company is building up it's foundations, hopefully the updated MRE in Ireland, dual listing and refinery contract to process more of the ore.  All whilst the POG has increased by $300 since the last update. All very positive",

          "content": "Going through former IMC company Announcements it is clear that the company went through a rigorous valuation assessment when having its RTO, which related to the acquisition of the Karaberd mine, approved for the LSE listing. Among other requirements the LSE rule for approval that applied was a valuation of \u00a330m.  If you read through the Prospectus provided at the time for the RTO, 28th October 2023,  a valuation for MVI, the takeover target, was given as a mid-point valuation of \u00a342m being between \u00a335m and \u00a349m based on various criteria. This valuation was provided by worldwide Independent Consultants Alvarez and Marsal who had access to JORC compliant Karaberd Mineral Resource Estimate (circa 60% Indicated 40% Inferred) prepared by Australian Geological Consultants AMC. On the date of approval of the RTO Gold Price was $2,007 Oz and Silver was $23 Oz. The Valuation prepared by Alvarez & Marsal did not include the Irish assets. IMC has a JORC compliant MRE for its assets and the impact of increased Gold, Silver and other metals prices on the valuation for its reserves in its above ground spoils and tailings is significant as can be seen from the Table in the annual report per the link below. https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/IMC/annual-financial-report/17304821 No doubt the Announcement of the renewal of the licence for another 9 years has been a major boost to the company's prospects, but so also has been the substantial increase in the Gold and Silver prices since the approval of the RTO in October 2023 when the IMC share raded at 3.00p. For that reason, I believe it is not surprising that IMC has recently secured the services of Armand Pinarbasi whose CV is impressive to say the least: https://www.imcexploration.com/corporate/board-of-directors IMO the IMC share price rise is the product of all of the above and as a future producer of Gold and Silver it is going to be a very interesting stock to watch and trade especially if it broadens its liquidy base with a dual listing on the Armenian Stock Exchange.",

This is also the region a number of holders may have just gotten out of the negative from a few years ago when the take over of the mine occurred. Still quite undervalued considering even just a 10% pricing of the metals at Karaberd alone...  Then on top of that the Eco refinery, which will help reduce the company reliance on mining and take in ore from other sites, and all the other opportunities in Ireland. I believe they had a team ready to start activities towards processing the tailings and spoils in Ireland. I think this is all getting this company into a great cash positive position to expand! And the fact the company has the prudence to run a lean ship, demonstrated over the last years, when things are delayed is great.  Bring on times when there's more free cash flow!",

Now for the Karaberd mine : The future processing plant will be able to process 100 000t/year. 30 000t/year are allowed to be extracted underground at an average grade of 4.7g/t So that's 70 000y/year left at open pit at an average grade of 1g/t 30000*4.7+70000*1 = 211 kg of gold/year 211kg is 7450 oz 7450 oz * 5000 usd = 37M of gross profits I'm not even counting the silver BTW, i'll let you do the math.. So even if we consider a conservative net profit of 20M/year (half of the gross and not even counting the silver), and a conservative PE of 5, that's still a 100M mcap company... And again, i'm not even counting the other assets... For those who can't understand why the parabolic move happened so fast, well because the marketcap was absolutely ridiculous, like literally a mcap of a near bankrupt company even though in reality, it's only the beginning of a future cash cow. Remember that MVI (the main shareholder which executed the RTO of the company) has bonuses in the contract (free shares) if the company reach  100Mcap for like 60 days, and again another bonus if IMC reaches a mcap of 200M for 60days + So you can bet they perfectly knows what they own.. The company is also owned at 90%+ by insiders! Even during the 2023 run, no insiders ever sold, and the CEO even bought the top.. That's why the liquidity is so thin and the upside movement so explosive, because the free float is tiny.",

They have $ Millions in rock stockpiled at surface. then their are their Irish assets. Listed on Main board of London Stock exchange. Also duel listed on Armenian Stock exchange which is 50% owned by Poland's stock exchange. (Think I got that right). IMO I think they may be also looking at more Acquisitions in future. Anyway still doing my own research about the company. Yes they could be more proactive on talking to investors on video about direction-news of company. Maybe they need a investor communications director that can do regular videos on Armenian mine and Irish etc Assets also any future news and acquisitions every 2 months or when any big company news comes out. Keeping the present and future investors engaged & up to date, is very important.",

Essentially, this stock just is not really watched by the market.  The reason is the extension of the mine being released and the muted reaction as well as the previous annual/half year report, where we can see the production starting and things coming together...

I feel it will take the latter for a breakout because a dual listing can still only access the same shares as here... And I don't think there are many shares outside LTH hands",

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

The sanctions did cause a ripple, but then at the same time the price of gold took off for when the ore is now being processed... There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer. At least at that point we'll start to be able to figure out an AISC too",

It's not by chance if MVI has just convert their debt into equity. They know the repricing is imminent. This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast.

Overall is as expected and does tidy up the open question for processing the ore ahead of the Armenian plant being built with that other non-Russian refinery.  I expect this year to be another where the company is building up it's foundations, hopefully the updated MRE in Ireland, dual listing and refinery contract to process more of the ore.  All whilst the POG has increased by $300 since the last update. All very positive",

          "content": "Going through former IMC company Announcements it is clear that the company went through a rigorous valuation assessment when having its RTO, which related to the acquisition of the Karaberd mine, approved for the LSE listing. Among other requirements the LSE rule for approval that applied was a valuation of \u00a330m.  If you read through the Prospectus provided at the time for the RTO, 28th October 2023,  a valuation for MVI, the takeover target, was given as a mid-point valuation of \u00a342m being between \u00a335m and \u00a349m based on various criteria. This valuation was provided by worldwide Independent Consultants Alvarez and Marsal who had access to JORC compliant Karaberd Mineral Resource Estimate (circa 60% Indicated 40% Inferred) prepared by Australian Geological Consultants AMC. On the date of approval of the RTO Gold Price was $2,007 Oz and Silver was $23 Oz. The Valuation prepared by Alvarez & Marsal did not include the Irish assets. IMC has a JORC compliant MRE for its assets and the impact of increased Gold, Silver and other metals prices on the valuation for its reserves in its above ground spoils and tailings is significant as can be seen from the Table in the annual report per the link below. https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/IMC/annual-financial-report/17304821 No doubt the Announcement of the renewal of the licence for another 9 years has been a major boost to the company's prospects, but so also has been the substantial increase in the Gold and Silver prices since the approval of the RTO in October 2023 when the IMC share raded at 3.00p. For that reason, I believe it is not surprising that IMC has recently secured the services of Armand Pinarbasi whose CV is impressive to say the least: https://www.imcexploration.com/corporate/board-of-directors IMO the IMC share price rise is the product of all of the above and as a future producer of Gold and Silver it is going to be a very interesting stock to watch and trade especially if it broadens its liquidy base with a dual listing on the Armenian Stock Exchange.",

Then on top of that the Eco refinery, which will help reduce the company reliance on mining and take in ore from other sites, and all the other opportunities in Ireland. I believe they had a team ready to start activities towards processing the tailings and spoils in Ireland. I think this is all getting this company into a great cash positive position to expand! And the fact the company has the prudence to run a lean ship, demonstrated over the last years, when things are delayed is great.  Bring on times when there's more free cash flow!",

          "content": "You are both wrong about the potential numbers, let me do some quick math : Current gold price : 5000 usd/oz and it will continue to goes up in the near future thanks to the de-dollarization around the world + the negative real interest rates (inflation being obviously way higher than reported in the western world). Now for the Karaberd mine : The future processing plant will be able to process 100 000t/year. 30 000t/year are allowed to be extracted underground at an average grade of 4.7g/t So that's 70 000y/year left at open pit at an average grade of 1g/t 30000*4.7+70000*1 = 211 kg of gold/year 211kg is 7450 oz 7450 oz * 5000 usd = 37M of gross profits I'm not even counting the silver BTW, i'll let you do the math.. So even if we consider a conservative net profit of 20M/year (half of the gross and not even counting the silver), and a conservative PE of 5, that's still a 100M mcap company... And again, i'm not even counting the other assets... For those who can't understand why the parabolic move happened so fast, well because the marketcap was absolutely ridiculous, like literally a mcap of a near bankrupt company even though in reality, it's only the beginning of a future cash cow. Remember that MVI (the main shareholder which executed the RTO of the company) has bonuses in the contract (free shares) if the company reach  100Mcap for like 60 days, and again another bonus if IMC reaches a mcap of 200M for 60days + So you can bet they perfectly knows what they own.. The company is also owned at 90%+ by insiders! Even during the 2023 run, no insiders ever sold, and the CEO even bought the top.. That's why the liquidity is so thin and the upside movement so explosive, because the free float is tiny.",

They have $ Millions in rock stockpiled at surface. then their are their Irish assets. Listed on Main board of London Stock exchange. Also duel listed on Armenian Stock exchange which is 50% owned by Poland's stock exchange. (Think I got that right). IMO I think they may be also looking at more Acquisitions in future. Anyway still doing my own research about the company. Yes they could be more proactive on talking to investors on video about direction-news of company. Maybe they need a investor communications director that can do regular videos on Armenian mine and Irish etc Assets also any future news and acquisitions every 2 months or when any big company news comes out. Keeping the present and future investors engaged & up to date, is very important.",

Check out what the share price did at those dates. (Hint, stayed stable). So I think that this is a very overdue correction.

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

The sanctions did cause a ripple, but then at the same time the price of gold took off for when the ore is now being processed... There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer. At least at that point we'll start to be able to figure out an AISC too",

I mean this company has a 86% insider ownership with deep connection into the Armenian political system and own a 1B already producing gold mine. It's not by chance if MVI has just convert their debt into equity. They know the repricing is imminent. This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast. This company is a textbook John Kaiser's bottom fish play.",

          "content": "Going through former IMC company Announcements it is clear that the company went through a rigorous valuation assessment when having its RTO, which related to the acquisition of the Karaberd mine, approved for the LSE listing. Among other requirements the LSE rule for approval that applied was a valuation of \u00a330m.  If you read through the Prospectus provided at the time for the RTO, 28th October 2023,  a valuation for MVI, the takeover target, was given as a mid-point valuation of \u00a342m being between \u00a335m and \u00a349m based on various criteria. This valuation was provided by worldwide Independent Consultants Alvarez and Marsal who had access to JORC compliant Karaberd Mineral Resource Estimate (circa 60% Indicated 40% Inferred) prepared by Australian Geological Consultants AMC. On the date of approval of the RTO Gold Price was $2,007 Oz and Silver was $23 Oz. The Valuation prepared by Alvarez & Marsal did not include the Irish assets. IMC has a JORC compliant MRE for its assets and the impact of increased Gold, Silver and other metals prices on the valuation for its reserves in its above ground spoils and tailings is significant as can be seen from the Table in the annual report per the link below. https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/IMC/annual-financial-report/17304821 No doubt the Announcement of the renewal of the licence for another 9 years has been a major boost to the company's prospects, but so also has been the substantial increase in the Gold and Silver prices since the approval of the RTO in October 2023 when the IMC share raded at 3.00p. For that reason, I believe it is not surprising that IMC has recently secured the services of Armand Pinarbasi whose CV is impressive to say the least: https://www.imcexploration.com/corporate/board-of-directors IMO the IMC share price rise is the product of all of the above and as a future producer of Gold and Silver it is going to be a very interesting stock to watch and trade especially if it broadens its liquidy base with a dual listing on the Armenian Stock Exchange.",

This is also the region a number of holders may have just gotten out of the negative from a few years ago when the take over of the mine occurred. Still quite undervalued considering even just a 10% pricing of the metals at Karaberd alone...  Then on top of that the Eco refinery, which will help reduce the company reliance on mining and take in ore from other sites, and all the other opportunities in Ireland. I believe they had a team ready to start activities towards processing the tailings and spoils in Ireland. I think this is all getting this company into a great cash positive position to expand! And the fact the company has the prudence to run a lean ship, demonstrated over the last years, when things are delayed is great.  Bring on times when there's more free cash flow!",

          "content": "You are both wrong about the potential numbers, let me do some quick math : Current gold price : 5000 usd/oz and it will continue to goes up in the near future thanks to the de-dollarization around the world + the negative real interest rates (inflation being obviously way higher than reported in the western world). Now for the Karaberd mine : The future processing plant will be able to process 100 000t/year. 30 000t/year are allowed to be extracted underground at an average grade of 4.7g/t So that's 70 000y/year left at open pit at an average grade of 1g/t 30000*4.7+70000*1 = 211 kg of gold/year 211kg is 7450 oz 7450 oz * 5000 usd = 37M of gross profits I'm not even counting the silver BTW, i'll let you do the math.. So even if we consider a conservative net profit of 20M/year (half of the gross and not even counting the silver), and a conservative PE of 5, that's still a 100M mcap company... And again, i'm not even counting the other assets... For those who can't understand why the parabolic move happened so fast, well because the marketcap was absolutely ridiculous, like literally a mcap of a near bankrupt company even though in reality, it's only the beginning of a future cash cow. Remember that MVI (the main shareholder which executed the RTO of the company) has bonuses in the contract (free shares) if the company reach  100Mcap for like 60 days, and again another bonus if IMC reaches a mcap of 200M for 60days + So you can bet they perfectly knows what they own.. The company is also owned at 90%+ by insiders! Even during the 2023 run, no insiders ever sold, and the CEO even bought the top.. That's why the liquidity is so thin and the upside movement so explosive, because the free float is tiny.",

I am glade they got the mining license for their producing mine in Armenia in the last week. I invested this afternoon. They have $ Millions in rock stockpiled at surface. then their are their Irish assets. Listed on Main board of London Stock exchange. Also duel listed on Armenian Stock exchange which is 50% owned by Poland's stock exchange. (Think I got that right). IMO I think they may be also looking at more Acquisitions in future. Anyway still doing my own research about the company. Yes they could be more proactive on talking to investors on video about direction-news of company. Maybe they need a investor communications director that can do regular videos on Armenian mine and Irish etc Assets also any future news and acquisitions every 2 months or when any big company news comes out. Keeping the present and future investors engaged & up to date, is very important.",

Check out what the share price did at those dates. (Hint, stayed stable). So I think that this is a very overdue correction.

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

The sanctions did cause a ripple, but then at the same time the price of gold took off for when the ore is now being processed... There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer. At least at that point we'll start to be able to figure out an AISC too",

I mean this company has a 86% insider ownership with deep connection into the Armenian political system and own a 1B already producing gold mine. It's not by chance if MVI has just convert their debt into equity. They know the repricing is imminent. This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast. This company is a textbook John Kaiser's bottom fish play.",

          "content": "Going through former IMC company Announcements it is clear that the company went through a rigorous valuation assessment when having its RTO, which related to the acquisition of the Karaberd mine, approved for the LSE listing. Among other requirements the LSE rule for approval that applied was a valuation of \u00a330m.  If you read through the Prospectus provided at the time for the RTO, 28th October 2023,  a valuation for MVI, the takeover target, was given as a mid-point valuation of \u00a342m being between \u00a335m and \u00a349m based on various criteria. This valuation was provided by worldwide Independent Consultants Alvarez and Marsal who had access to JORC compliant Karaberd Mineral Resource Estimate (circa 60% Indicated 40% Inferred) prepared by Australian Geological Consultants AMC. On the date of approval of the RTO Gold Price was $2,007 Oz and Silver was $23 Oz. The Valuation prepared by Alvarez & Marsal did not include the Irish assets. IMC has a JORC compliant MRE for its assets and the impact of increased Gold, Silver and other metals prices on the valuation for its reserves in its above ground spoils and tailings is significant as can be seen from the Table in the annual report per the link below. https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/IMC/annual-financial-report/17304821 No doubt the Announcement of the renewal of the licence for another 9 years has been a major boost to the company's prospects, but so also has been the substantial increase in the Gold and Silver prices since the approval of the RTO in October 2023 when the IMC share raded at 3.00p. For that reason, I believe it is not surprising that IMC has recently secured the services of Armand Pinarbasi whose CV is impressive to say the least: https://www.imcexploration.com/corporate/board-of-directors IMO the IMC share price rise is the product of all of the above and as a future producer of Gold and Silver it is going to be a very interesting stock to watch and trade especially if it broadens its liquidy base with a dual listing on the Armenian Stock Exchange.",

This is also the region a number of holders may have just gotten out of the negative from a few years ago when the take over of the mine occurred. Still quite undervalued considering even just a 10% pricing of the metals at Karaberd alone...  Then on top of that the Eco refinery, which will help reduce the company reliance on mining and take in ore from other sites, and all the other opportunities in Ireland. I believe they had a team ready to start activities towards processing the tailings and spoils in Ireland. I think this is all getting this company into a great cash positive position to expand! And the fact the company has the prudence to run a lean ship, demonstrated over the last years, when things are delayed is great.  Bring on times when there's more free cash flow!",

          "content": "You are both wrong about the potential numbers, let me do some quick math : Current gold price : 5000 usd/oz and it will continue to goes up in the near future thanks to the de-dollarization around the world + the negative real interest rates (inflation being obviously way higher than reported in the western world). Now for the Karaberd mine : The future processing plant will be able to process 100 000t/year. 30 000t/year are allowed to be extracted underground at an average grade of 4.7g/t So that's 70 000y/year left at open pit at an average grade of 1g/t 30000*4.7+70000*1 = 211 kg of gold/year 211kg is 7450 oz 7450 oz * 5000 usd = 37M of gross profits I'm not even counting the silver BTW, i'll let you do the math.. So even if we consider a conservative net profit of 20M/year (half of the gross and not even counting the silver), and a conservative PE of 5, that's still a 100M mcap company... And again, i'm not even counting the other assets... For those who can't understand why the parabolic move happened so fast, well because the marketcap was absolutely ridiculous, like literally a mcap of a near bankrupt company even though in reality, it's only the beginning of a future cash cow. Remember that MVI (the main shareholder which executed the RTO of the company) has bonuses in the contract (free shares) if the company reach  100Mcap for like 60 days, and again another bonus if IMC reaches a mcap of 200M for 60days + So you can bet they perfectly knows what they own.. The company is also owned at 90%+ by insiders! Even during the 2023 run, no insiders ever sold, and the CEO even bought the top.. That's why the liquidity is so thin and the upside movement so explosive, because the free float is tiny.",

They have $ Millions in rock stockpiled at surface. then their are their Irish assets. Listed on Main board of London Stock exchange. Also duel listed on Armenian Stock exchange which is 50% owned by Poland's stock exchange. (Think I got that right). IMO I think they may be also looking at more Acquisitions in future. Anyway still doing my own research about the company. Yes they could be more proactive on talking to investors on video about direction-news of company. Maybe they need a investor communications director that can do regular videos on Armenian mine and Irish etc Assets also any future news and acquisitions every 2 months or when any big company news comes out. Keeping the present and future investors engaged & up to date, is very important.",

Check out what the share price did at those dates. (Hint, stayed stable). So I think that this is a very overdue correction.

The Avoca spoils (on current metal prices) were reported to be worth \u00a371,346,400 (RNS'd) against the current Mcap of just \u00a36.5m but it is the Wexford project that I am most interested in given the previous bonanza gold grade but also the recent reported gold grades. IMC say in the RNS dated 21 March 2024 that \"Both the upper and lower zones are open along strike and to depth. Geological interpretation suggests more structural zones are present\". Taking into account the gold price currently and the POTENTIAL for further price increases in the coming years (if gold goes up of course), then lower grades are going to be more commercially viable to mine IMO. There is copper (Avoca spoils) aswell as gold, silver and lead and the copper price has increased at a progressive rate over the last few years. Copper use is very widespread in various industries. News flow is fairly limited on this share but with further positive news flow and trading volume then this may support an increase in the SP from current levels - dependent on buying pressure etc.  I note that as recent as Nov 2023 the SP was over 2p. DYOR though and have a good read of the last annual/half year reports & updates.",

The RNS states they have already started processing the stockpiled ore at Karaberd, of which there is a very reasonable amount. Just sounds like they're timing it to empty the stockpiled ore off to a refinery before additional ore is piled on top and before their Masis refinery could accommodate the higher monthly input. So, compared to 2019, where there was a presentation showing the company with just Avoca and other Irish interests, Mcap \u00a35m. 2025, Mcap \u00a35m, beyond the 2019 point, it owns an operational mine with 240000oz Gold, has always planned to find further 200k-300koz mines to expand and help in Armenia, has plans for a refinery in country (eco friendly approach), is likely going to use the revenue from the Armenia mine to fund the new refinery and anything in Ireland (limited debt requirements).  So, mitigating the risk of single mine collapse, being a refiner as well, multiple jurisdictions, focusing on spoils and tailings (shovel and crusher) to work with governments to clear land. In top of that, the likely currency debasement since 2019.  Ie, \u00a31 from 2019 is not worth \u00a31 today, but less... Therefore the \u00a35m Mcap from 2019 would need to be higher today to accommodate. From a pure value perspective, this is undervalued and if over time they do manage to do this, the potential return here looks alright.... I wonder if this is just missed because retail investors are looking for small caps on the AIM market, whereas this is on the Main market as well.  In NO way thinking this should be in AIM... Not one bit!!! .... But just a thought.",

The sanctions did cause a ripple, but then at the same time the price of gold took off for when the ore is now being processed... There are plenty of miners on AIM and I think that until next year when we have the higher grade from the underground being sold and the sale income from what is being crushed now, this is likely to remain in the background....  Judging by a single trade today. But looking at the stock from a value perspective, the Mcap from the tailings in Avoca alone make it seem wrong ... A crusher and some big shovels could get it going... It's been quite the wait for this to get to this point.  I feel the board changes should line up the dual listing for some success and hopefully it won't be too much longer and we'll book some profits as a producer. At least at that point we'll start to be able to figure out an AISC too",

I mean this company has a 86% insider ownership with deep connection into the Armenian political system and own a 1B already producing gold mine. It's not by chance if MVI has just convert their debt into equity. They know the repricing is imminent. This RNS is absolutely outstanding, they announced they already restarted the ore processing (and start extracting again) and cash flow will start to flow like it was supposed to do in October 2023. The Russian-owned plant sanctioned was just bad luck (Even the CEO bought the top) but now everything is on track again. This company has a 5M mcap, worth less than the stockpile they are starting to process right now.. And the mine is worth... a billion (250k oz in gold). The underground mining activities will start in April 2026, again perfection. Absolutely crazy. And i'm only talking about Armenia. Not even counting the potential in Ireland. Top management and execution, just almost non-existent communication which doesn't help the company getting a proper valuation, but a sharp repricing will happen soon and fast. This company is a textbook John Kaiser's bottom fish play.",
