Any offer, if made, will be made solely by certain offer documentation which will contain the full terms and conditions of any offer, including details of how it may be accepted.The release, distribution or publication of this announcement in whole or in part, directly or indirectly in, into or from jurisdictions outside the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0may be restricted by law and therefore persons into whose possession this announcement comes should inform themselves about, and observe, such restrictions. Any failure to comply with the restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities law of any such jurisdiction.\nDisclosure requirements of the Code\nUnder Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) of the Code applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.\nUnder Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8 of the Code. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) of the Code applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Code.\nOpening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4 of the Code).\nDetails of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Takeover Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panel's Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.\nRule 26.1 Disclosure\nIn accordance with Rule 26.1 of the Code, a copy of this announcement will be available on FCM's website (www.firstclassmetalsplc.com) by no later than 12 noon (London\u00a0time) on the business day following the date of this announcement.

In particular, the Hemlo 'camp' near Marathon, Ontario is a proven world class address for gold exploration, featuring the Hemlo gold deposit operated by Barrick Mining (>23M oz gold produced), with the past producing Geco and Winston Lake base metal deposits also situated in the region.\nFCM currently holds 100% ownership of seven claim blocks covering over 250km\u00b2 in northwest Ontario. A further three blocks are under option and cover an additional 30km2.FCM is focussed on exploring for gold but has base metals and critical metals mineralisation. FCM is maintaining a joint venture with GT Resources on the West Pickle Lake Property a drill-proven ultra-high-grade Ni-Cu project.\nThe flagship properties, North Hemlo and Sunbeam, are gold focussed. North Hemlo has a significant discovery in the Dead Otter trend which is a discontinuous 3.5km gold anomalous trend with a 19.6g/t Au peak grab sample. This sampling being the highest known assay from a grab sample ever recorded on the North Limb of Hemlo.\nIn October 2022 FCM completed the option to purchase the historical high-grade past-producing Sunbeam gold mine near Atikokan, Ontario, ~15 km southeast of Agnico Eagle's Hammond Reef gold deposit (3.3 Moz of open pit probable gold reserves).\nFCM acquired the Zigzag Project near Armstrong, Ontario in March 2023. The property features Li-Ta-bearing pegmatites in the same belt as Green Technology Metals' Seymour Lake Project, which contains a Mineral Resource estimate of 9.9 Mt @ 1.04% Li2O. Zigzag was successfully drilled prior to Christmas 2023 and results have now been released.\nThe Kerrs Gold property, acquired under option by First Class Metals in April 2024, is located in northeastern Ontario within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most prolific gold-producing regions. The project holds a historical inferred resource of approximately 386,000 ounces of gold, underscoring its potential as a meaningful addition to FCM's expanding gold portfolio. Kerrs Gold complements the Company's exploration strategy and provides exposure to a well-established mining district. FCM is currently reviewing plans to advance the project and further unlock its value.\nThe significant potential of the properties for precious, base and battery metals relates to 'nearology', since all properties lie in the same districts as known deposits (Hemlo, Hammond Reef, Seymour Lake), and either contain known showings, geochemical or geophysical anomalies, or favourable structures along strike from known showings (e.g. the Esa project, with an inferred Hemlo-style shear along strike from known gold occurrences).\nFor further information see the Company's presentation on the web site:\nfirstclassmetalsplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFIRST CLASS METALS PLC\n13 January 2026\nFCM Secures Options over Two Ontario REE Properties\nFirst Class Metals PLC (\"First Class Metals\", \"FCM\"\nor the\n\"Company\")\nthe UK listed company focused on the discovery of economic metal deposits across its exploration properties in Ontario, Canada, is pleased to announce the successful completion of an option to purchase two properties with highly anomalous Rare Earth Elements\n(\"REE\")\nsamples.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFCM expands its exploration portfolio to include\nRare Earth Elements complementing\nits core gold exploration strategy in Ontario\n\u00b7\nThe option terms for both properties are\nhighly favourable in year one,\nallowing FCM to assess REE potential with limited upfront financial exposure.\n\u00b7\nThe two optioned properties, Block H (~18km\u00b2) and Block F (~33km\u00b2), are located within one of the\nmost anomalous REE regions\nidentified in the Ontario province-wide lake sediment geochemical database.\n\u00b7\nInitial exploration planned for Spring 2026 will focus on ground-truthing historic anomalies, validating assays, and refining geological controls on mineralisation.\n\u00b7\nBoth blocks are believed to lie within the traditional territory of Lac des Mille Lacs First Nation, with whom FCM already maintains a constructive working relationship.\n\u00b7\nThe Company intends to rename Block H and Block F via an\nonline poll\n, enhancing stakeholder engagement and market visibility.\n\u00b7\nGlobal REE supply remains\nhighly concentrated\n, with China dominating both production and downstream processing, driving Western governments to prioritise\nsecure, allied-source supply chains\n.\n\u00b7\nThorium-associated REE systems are increasingly attracting attention due to their potential to host\nlight and heavy REE assemblages\n, which are essential for high-value permanent magnet applications.\nMarc J. Sale CEO First Class Metals commented:\n\"\nGold remains the cornerstone of FCM's exploration strategy and continues to underpin our approach to value accretion to FCM's Ontario properties. However, against a backdrop of accelerating global demand for Rare Earth Elements, and a clear strategic shift by allied governments towards securing critical minerals, the opportunity presented by these two properties is particularly compelling. Their geochemical and geographic location allows FCM to gain meaningful exposure to this evolving sector while maintaining our gold-focused exploration strategy and Ontario focus.\"\nOption Terms\nFirst Class Metals has entered into option agreements to acquire a\n100% interest\nin both Block F and Block H (each subject to a production royalty). The options are structured over a three-year period and provide the Company with the ability to evaluate the properties with limited upfront financial commitment.\nBlock F\nTo exercise the option over Block F, the Company must make\ntotal cash payments of CAD $73,500\nand issue\nCAD $60,000 in ordinary shares\nof the Company (\"Shares\") to the optionors over three years. Cash payments comprise CAD $9,500 payable within 30 working days of signing the agreement (the \"Effective Date\"), CAD $10,000 payable on the first anniversary of the Effective Date, CAD $16,000 on the second anniversary, and CAD $38,000 on the third anniversary.

Any failure to comply with the restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities law of any such jurisdiction.\nDisclosure requirements of the Code\nUnder Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s).

In particular, the Hemlo 'camp' near Marathon, Ontario is a proven world class address for gold exploration, featuring the Hemlo gold deposit operated by Barrick Mining (>23M oz gold produced), with the past producing Geco and Winston Lake base metal deposits also situated in the region.\nFCM currently holds 100% ownership of seven claim blocks covering over 250km\u00b2 in northwest Ontario. A further three blocks are under option and cover an additional 30km2.FCM is focussed on exploring for gold but has base metals and critical metals mineralisation. FCM is maintaining a joint venture with GT Resources on the West Pickle Lake Property a drill-proven ultra-high-grade Ni-Cu project.\nThe flagship properties, North Hemlo and Sunbeam, are gold focussed. North Hemlo has a significant discovery in the Dead Otter trend which is a discontinuous 3.5km gold anomalous trend with a 19.6g/t Au peak grab sample. This sampling being the highest known assay from a grab sample ever recorded on the North Limb of Hemlo.\nIn October 2022 FCM completed the option to purchase the historical high-grade past-producing Sunbeam gold mine near Atikokan, Ontario, ~15 km southeast of Agnico Eagle's Hammond Reef gold deposit (3.3 Moz of open pit probable gold reserves).\nFCM acquired the Zigzag Project near Armstrong, Ontario in March 2023. The property features Li-Ta-bearing pegmatites in the same belt as Green Technology Metals' Seymour Lake Project, which contains a Mineral Resource estimate of 9.9 Mt @ 1.04% Li2O. Zigzag was successfully drilled prior to Christmas 2023 and results have now been released.\nThe Kerrs Gold property, acquired under option by First Class Metals in April 2024, is located in northeastern Ontario within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most prolific gold-producing regions. The project holds a historical inferred resource of approximately 386,000 ounces of gold, underscoring its potential as a meaningful addition to FCM's expanding gold portfolio. Kerrs Gold complements the Company's exploration strategy and provides exposure to a well-established mining district. FCM is currently reviewing plans to advance the project and further unlock its value.\nThe significant potential of the properties for precious, base and battery metals relates to 'nearology', since all properties lie in the same districts as known deposits (Hemlo, Hammond Reef, Seymour Lake), and either contain known showings, geochemical or geophysical anomalies, or favourable structures along strike from known showings (e.g. the Esa project, with an inferred Hemlo-style shear along strike from known gold occurrences).\nFor further information see the Company's presentation on the web site:\nfirstclassmetalsplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

A\nvideo\nof a representative cut core section displaying\nmultiple deformed structures, contact, clasts veining and sulphide mineralisation\nis available via the link below.\nhttps://firstclassmetalsplc.com/link/yOO9ky\nMarc J. Sale CEO First Class Metals commented:\n\"To date, the maiden drill programme on the Dead Otter trend has been both technically and logistically successful, particularly given the inclement as well as challenging weather conditions. The Emerald Geological Services team has executed the plan efficiently, and early indications from the core are encouraging.\nWhile assays will ultimately determine the significance of these intervals, the geological features observed to date reinforce our confidence in the Dead Otter trend as a compelling gold target within the North Hemlo Project. We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year and to completing the balance of the programme before the Christmas break.\"\nLocation & Strategic Context\nThe North Hemlo Project is situated within the world-class Hemlo Greenstone Belt, a district that has produced more than 23 million ounces of gold since discovery. In early December 2025, Barrick Gold Corporation completed the sale of its Hemlo Mine to Hemlo Mining Corporation (\"\nHMC\n\") in a transaction valued at up to\nUS$1.09 billion\n. That transaction signaled a renewed and focused investment into the Hemlo district and reflects continued interest in evaluating the region's exploration potential. First Class Metals' Dead Otter trend lies contiguous with HMC's regional exploration holdings.\nFigure 1\nshowing the Dead Otter trend with locations of the initial 6 drillholes which are logged and sampled.

These areas represent key focal points of gold anomalism and structural complexity along the trend.\nFigure 2\nshowing a section of uncut core from the Dead Otter trend displaying sulphides which could indicate potential mineralisation.\nFigure 3\nshowing cut core displaying quartz veining and course pyrite.\nA second target area, including the site of the\n2.3 g/t Au sample\nand the interpreted granite contact, has also been tested with two additional holes.\nEmerald Geological Services ('\nEGS\n') continue to oversee and manage all drill-site geological operations, including core logging, sampling, and photography at their Manitouwadge facility.\nThe drilling contract minimum of 700m drilling will be surpassed at the completion of the programme.\nGiven the seasonal volume of samples being processed across the region, combined with the Christmas-New Year period, assay turnaround times are difficult to estimate accurately at this stage.\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance ('ESG')\nFCM takes its ESG responsibilities seriously and this attitude is ",

Sale CEO First Class Metals Commented:\n\"The initiation of drilling on the Dead Otter trend as a result of securing funding is not only an exciting exploration stage for FCM and an enhancement of the potential of the North Hemlo block, but it is a significant event in the development of FCM as an exploration company. I anticipate that the VLF survey will add significant exploration upside to not only the Dead Otter trend but the whole property block including the OnGold claims\"\nFigure 1\nshowing the Dead otter trend with VLF grids and significant grab samples\nDrilling Programme Details\nThe securing of the recent CLN funding has allowed FCM to commit to drilling and accordingly it has signed a contract with Rugged Aviation Inc ('Rugged'), a\nhighly experienced\ndiamond drilling company with years of experience drilling the archaean rocks of northwest Ontario. Rugged has drilled substantial metreage within the Hemlo camp and is well placed to support FCM's technical objectives.\n\u00b7\nThe contract is for a minimum of 700m of NQ diameter drilling.\n\u00b7\nFCM anticipates exceeding this minimum drill requirement as drilling progresses along the Dead Otter trend, including:\no\nThe\n'19 grammer'\n(19.6g/t Au)\nhigh grade\nsample site.\no\nThe '\nDead Otter Showing'\no\nUp to two additional targets along strike.\nThe drill rig arrived on site on 16 November 2025 and coring is commencing immediately.\nInitial holes will target both the location of the 19.6 g/t sample and areas of\nhighly deformed (\"messed up\") rocks\nmapped by Prof. Mary Louise Hill, Professor Emerita, Lakehead University.\nFigure 2\nshowing the track mounted Rugged Aviation drill rig onsite at the '19 grammer'\nSite Operations and Sample Handling\nEmerald Geological Services are overseeing the on-site activities, including:\n\u00b7\nCore handling and transfer to the secure Manitouwadge facility.\n\u00b7\nLogging, photographing, and sample mark-up.\n\u00b7\nCore cutting and sampling.\n\u00b7\nBagging, tagging and shipment to Act Labs, Thunder Bay for gold, silver, and base metal assays\nGiven the seasonal volume of samples being processed across the region, combined with the Christmas/New Year period, assay turnaround times are difficult to estimate accurately at this stage.\nFigure 3\nshowing the drilling machinery at work.\nVLF Survey Interpretation\nThe initial review of the VLF survey data has indicated encouraging trends on all grids surveyed. The data is still with the company for final processing and interpretation, whilst this process is taking longer than expected FCM believes it will provide significant exploration targets for next season's field work not only along the Dead Otter trend but property wide, including the extension of Dotted Lake and the OnGold claims.\nInvestor Hub - Onsite Video\nA video update from\nMarc Sale, CEO\n, filmed on site as drilling operations commenced, is now available on the\nFCM InvestorHub\nhttps://firstclassmetalsplc.com/link/y1B8le\nENDS\nQualified Person\nThe technical disclosures contained in this announcement have been drafted in line with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum standards and guidelines and approved by Marc J.

The conversion price will be 80% of the lowest five-day VWAP prior to any conversion notice.\nConversion of the Convertible Loan Note is mandatory at maturity, though the Company retains the option to redeem any outstanding balance of the CLN at 125% of nominal value. A 2% commitment fee will be offset against the drawdown at the time of funding.\nAs part of the funding arrangement, the Investor will also have the option to purchase \u00a3250,000 in warrants in First Class Metals PLC (\"Warrants\"). The Warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to 120% of the Company's closing market price on 11 November 2025, being 3.18 pence per share based on a closing price of 2.65 pence. A total of 7,861,635 Warrants will be issued.

The drilling programme aims to capitalise on the remaining seasonal window before ground conditions deteriorate with the onset of winter.\nCorporate Update\nThe Company is pleased to report that negotiations regarding the potential asset sale are advancing, with due diligence complete and commercial terms agreed. The funding secured through this Convertible Loan Note is intended to bridge the timing gap between ongoing operations and the anticipated closing of this transaction.\nNext Steps\nFunds from the Convertible Loan Note are expected to be received shortly, allowing mobilisation of drill crew. The Company will update shareholders on operational progress and on developments regarding the asset sale in due course.\nJames Knowles, Executive Chairman commented:\n\"This agreement with the Investor provides FCM with the immediate flexibility to advance exploration at North Hemlo, where the planned drilling campaign represents a pivotal and exciting phase for the Company.

In particular, the Hemlo 'camp' near Marathon, Ontario is a proven world class address for gold exploration, featuring the Hemlo gold deposit operated by Barrick Mining (>23M oz gold produced), with the past producing Geco and Winston Lake base metal deposits also situated in the region.\nFCM currently holds 100% ownership of seven claim blocks covering over 250km\u00b2 in northwest Ontario. A further three blocks are under option and cover an additional 30km2.FCM is focussed on exploring for gold but has base metals and critical metals mineralisation. FCM is maintaining a joint venture with GT Resources on the West Pickle Lake Property a drill-proven ultra-high-grade Ni-Cu project.\nThe flagship properties, North Hemlo and Sunbeam, are gold focussed. North Hemlo has a significant discovery in the Dead Otter trend which is a discontinuous 3.5km gold anomalous trend with a 19.6g/t Au peak grab sample. This sampling being the highest known assay from a grab sample ever recorded on the North Limb of Hemlo.\nIn October 2022 FCM completed the option to purchase the historical high-grade past-producing Sunbeam gold mine near Atikokan, Ontario, ~15 km southeast of Agnico Eagle's Hammond Reef gold deposit (3.3 Moz of open pit probable gold reserves).\nFCM acquired the Zigzag Project near Armstrong, Ontario in March 2023. The property features Li-Ta-bearing pegmatites in the same belt as Green Technology Metals' Seymour Lake Project, which contains a Mineral Resource estimate of 9.9 Mt @ 1.04% Li2O. Zigzag was successfully drilled prior to Christmas 2023 and results have now been released.\nThe Kerrs Gold property, acquired under option by First Class Metals in April 2024, is located in northeastern Ontario within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most prolific gold-producing regions. The project holds a historical inferred resource of approximately 386,000 ounces of gold, underscoring its potential as a meaningful addition to FCM's expanding gold portfolio. Kerrs Gold complements the Company's exploration strategy and provides exposure to a well-established mining district. FCM is currently reviewing plans to advance the project and further unlock its value.\nThe significant potential of the properties for precious, base and battery metals relates to 'nearology', since all properties lie in the same districts as known deposits (Hemlo, Hammond Reef, Seymour Lake), and either contain known showings, geochemical or geophysical anomalies, or favourable structures along strike from known showings (e.g. the Esa project, with an inferred Hemlo-style shear along strike from known gold occurrences).\nFor further information see the Company's presentation on the web site:\nfirstclassmetalsplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Our exploration efforts in Ontario, Canada, have advanced materially, particularly at the flagship Sunbeam and North Hemlo Properties. We have also taken important steps in corporate governance, funding strategy, and portfolio management to position the Company for sustainable growth.\nThe early part of the year saw the Board focus on completing the strategic investment from 79th GRP Limited (\"79th GRP\") that had been announced in December 2024. The first stage of this investment was completed on 25 February 2025 following the passing of the necessary resolutions at a General Meeting of the Company and the publication of an FCA approved prospectus. This also saw David Webster appointed as a director and Non-Executive Chairman. Immediately following this, the media reported that allegations had been made by the City of London Police concerning 79th GRP and as result the second stage of the investment did not proceed and Mr Webster resigned from the Board. 79th GRP subsequently appointed administrators.\nDespite the second stage of a planned strategic investment not proceeding, the Board moved swiftly to secure the Company's financial flexibility through alternative funding arrangements. This decisive action has allowed us to maintain momentum across our exploration programmes without disruption. Encouragingly, we have received strong interest from a range of potential partners - both equity and non-equity, reflecting continued market recognition of the quality, scale, and strategic positioning of our asset portfolio.\nAt Board level, my return as Executive Chairman has provided continuity of leadership and sharpened our strategic focus. We have reinforced our governance framework and operational discipline to ensure that the Company remains agile in both its technical execution and its corporate decision-making.\nWith a robust project pipeline, a clear technical roadmap, and a well-capitalised plan for the months ahead, we have entered the second half of the year with renewed energy. Our focus is on delivering tangible progress at our priority projects, advancing towards defined value milestones, and ensuring that First Class Metals continues to strengthen its standing as one of the most active and ambitious exploration companies in Ontario.\nJames Knowles\nExecutive Chairman\nOperational Review\nSunbeam Project\nWork at Sunbeam during the first half of 2025 has centred on the winter exploration programme and the ramp-up of the current field season. Winter lake sediment sampling was undertaken across both the original property and the recently staked extension ground, marking the first systematic geochemical coverage of these new areas. Reference samples were also collected around the historic Sunbeam, Roy, and Pettigrew developments to benchmark anomalism levels.\nPreliminary results have highlighted several new gold-anomalous catchments within the extension ground, extending the known mineralised footprint and providing fresh targets for follow-up. Importantly, the winter fieldwork was complemented by the input of Professor Mary Louise Hill, whose on-site structural observations at Roy have sharpened our understanding of the controls on mineralisation. This insight is now being integrated with soil geochemistry, geophysics, and LiDAR interpretation to further refine drill targeting.\nThe late-2024 orientation soil survey, which revealed cohesive gold anomalies, most notably around the Roy zone, is now being expanded into a wider grid, focussed on a section of the Roy lineament. This larger survey aims to identify additional zones along the Roy structure, prioritising those with the strongest gold-in-soil responses for drilling consideration.\nThis systematic approach, combining Professor Hill's structura",

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFIRST CLASS METALS PLC\nStrategic MOU with Valereum Plc to Explore Tokenised Funding for Mineral Projects\nFirst Class Metals PLC (\"First Class Metals\" or the \"Company\"), the UK-listed exploration company focused on the discovery of economic metal deposits across its strategic footprint in Ontario, Canada, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") with Valereum Plc (\"Valereum\"), a market-leading digital asset infrastructure group listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange (AQSE: VLRM).\nThe MOU sets out a framework for both parties to\nevaluate\nthe potential for applying regulated tokenisation to fund mineral exploration and development projects within First Class Metals' asset portfolio.\nPioneering a Modern Approach to Project-Level Funding\nThis strategic collaboration combines First Class Metals' exploration expertise and project pipeline with Valereum's innovative, regulated digital asset infrastructure to evaluate the development of a tokenised investment model for mineral exploration projects.\nThe initiative aims to create a digital pathway for project-level funding that:\n\u00b7\nEnables project-level funding through SPV participation, preserving shareholder value on a non-dilutive basis for the Company's shareholders.\n\u00b7\nFacilitating market access to global investors with direct participation into high-potential mineral resource projects.\n\u00b7\nUtilises existing regulated legal structures to issue fully compliant tokens with KYC/AML fulfilment.\n\u00b7\nSupports ESG-aligned, responsible investment structures.\n\u00b7\nAligns with global investment trends, including the rapid expansion of the Real-World Asset (\"RWA\") tokenisation market, forecast to exceed US$16 trillion by 2030\n[1]\n.\nThe parties believe this represents the first serious attempt by a UK-listed resource company to apply regulated tokenisation to the mineral exploration sector - a development that could fundamentally transform how early-stage mineral exploration projects are financed and advanced.\nSpecific project selection remains under review, with further announcements to follow once assets are formally identified. It is emphasised that the MOU is\nnon-binding and exploratory in nature\n, and there is no certainty that any transaction, investment, or tokenisation event will ultimately occur.\nBy exploring the application of regulated tokenisation to mineral projects, First Class Metals and Valereum are evaluating how such models could enhance investor access, support non-dilutive capital formation, and align with the increasing emphasis on ESG-aligned financing in the resource sector.\nIt is emphasised that the Company remains committed to its fundamental identity as a mineral resource exploration company.\nJames Knowles, Chairman of First Class Metals, commented:\n\"This collaboration represents a bold, forward-thinking approach to unlocking the value of our highly prospective portfolio while preserving shareholder value at the PLC level. By partnering with Valereum, a recognised innovator in regulated digital assets, we are positioning First Class Metals at the forefront of responsible, modern exploration finance. This has the potential to reshape how mineral projects like ours are funded, developed, and ultimately delivered.\"\nPete Sekhon, Valereum Business Development commented:\n\"I have known James for a number of years, and when this opportunity presented itself, it made so much sense on many levels. We are excited about exploring what can be done together. This collaboration represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of both mining and blockchain. Bringing together Valereum's expertise in digital assets with FCM's high-quality exploration portfolio in Canada opens the door to a new era of capital markets access for mining. Tokenisation offers a route to unlock the value of in-ground resources in a regulated and accessible way.\"\nFor Further Information:\nEngage with us by asking questions, watching video summaries, and seeing what other shareholders have to say.\nNavigate to our Interactive Investor hub here\n:\nhttps://fcm-l.investorhub.com/link/MP7o0P\nFor further information, please contact:\nJames Knowles, Executive Chair & Managing Director\nEmail:\nJamesK@Firstclassmetalsplc.com\nTel: 07488 362641\nMarc J Sale, CEO\nEmail:\nMarcS@Firstclassmetalsplc.com\nTel: 07711 093532\nNovum Securities Limited (Financial Adviser)\nDavid Coffman\nWebsite:\nwww.novumsecurities",

Sale CEO First Class Metals Commented:\n\"The Winter work programme was an operational success and the results it has produced are exceptional, generating robust exploration targets on the two main properties - North Hemlo and Sunbeam. We remain encouraged with the potential of the Roy structure at Sunbeam after the property visit with a renowned structural geologist, potentially a eureka moment!\n\"\nWinter work programme:\nNorth Hemlo Exploration VLF survey:\n\u00b7\nVLF survey at 5 distinct locations.\n\u00b7\n7 grab samples from 'H' lake structure.\n\u00b7\nVLF survey over the Dead Otter trend initiated, three grab samples to date.\n\u00b7\nStructural review\nof the Dead Otter trend planned.\nFive areas were subjected to VLF gridded survey, the largest being H lake' where 7 grab samples were also collected. The survey areas also included the 103ppb lake sediment sample on the OnGold property\nFigure 1\nshows the locations of the Winter programme VLF 'grids' at North Hemlo, excepting the Dead Otter grid(s).\nThe VLF survey is still being reprocessed but the initial findings show strong conductors at 'H lake' and Rogers lake (north). Rogers lake was the 'focus' of several anomalous lake sediment samples from a previous winter programme.\nIt is anticipated that once all the data has been processed there will be a number of robust targets warranting follow up 'ground truthing' / prospecting, see Figure 2 for an example of the initial VLF identified conductors\nFigure 2\nshowing VLF identified conductors under the lake with anomalous gold results from lake sediment samples\nThe initial readings from the OnGold area are also most encouraging with obvious conductors being identified. This is especially significant as an exploration target as this lake contained a very high gold value in the lake sediment, (103ppb) one of the highest in the Hemlo camp as was previously reported by Bruce MacLachlan of Emerald Geological services.\nThe fact that all requirements have now been met under the Option agreement with OnGold has resulted in the 'OnGold claims' now being transferred to First Class Metals Canada Inc (\"FCMC\") 100%, making the combined North Hemlo property block 81km2 (not including the West Pickle Lake JV with GT Resources).\nThe VLF survey over the Dead Otter trend was initiated in late May. The survey had been annexed from the winter work programme because of the depth of snow making access difficult in conjunction with the topography. The map below shows ",

The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFIRST CLASS METALS PLC\n05 JUNE 2025\nCorporate Update, LOI Announcement and Fundraising\nFirst Class Metals PLC (LSE: FCM) is pleased to announce that it has signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") in relation to a potential disposal of one of its properties. The proposed transaction, if completed, would be material to the Company and reflects the growing third-party interest in the Company's highly prospective portfolio.\nThe proposed consideration is entirely cash, and the prospective purchaser is currently undertaking detailed due diligence with the intention to move to binding documentation as soon as possible. Whilst there can be no certainty at this stage that a transaction will complete, the Board is encouraged by the progress to date.\nThe Company is also pleased to confirm that it has successfully raised gross proceeds of \u00a3520,000 through the issue of 26,000,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1p each at a price of 2p per share, representing a discount of approximately 7% to the closing mid-market price of 2.15p on 4 June 2025, being the last trading day prior to this announcement. This comprises a placing of 25,000,000 new ordinary shares raising \u00a3500,000 via Clear Capital Markets Limited (\"CCM\"), the Company's placing agent, with the shares placed with institutional and high net worth investors, and a private subscription of \u00a320,000 by Non-Executive Director Marc Bamber for 1,000,000 new ordinary shares.\nThe proceeds will strengthen the Company's working capital position and enable further exploration work across its portfolio. This includes targeted programmes in the early part of the summer focused on refining and defining key targets, which are expected to lead to more invasive fieldwork and drilling in the latter part of the season.\nDirector Participation in the Fundraising\nAs part of the fundraising, the Company confirms that Marc Bamber, Non-Executive Director, has subscribed for 1,000,000 new ordinary shares at a price of 2p per share for a total consideration of \u00a320,000. Following this subscription, Marc Bamber will be interested in 1,375,000 ordinary shares.\nMarc Sale, CEO of First Class Metals, commented:\n\"This potential transaction is not only a strong endorsement of the underlying value in our portfolio, but also as it's a significant cash deal has the probability to be transformational for the Company. We are confident this is a pivotal moment for First Class Metals as we move decisively to unlock that value for shareholders.\"\nJames Knowles, Chairman of First Class Metals, added:\n\"Following the withdrawal of the second stage investment from 79TH GRP earlier this year, it was important for the Board to act decisively. This fundraise provides the financial flexibility to advance our exploration strategy over the coming months, with early summer work aimed at generating meaningful results.\nTotal Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") for admission of the 26,000,000 new ordinary shares to the Equity Shares (transition) category of the Official List, and to the London Stock Exchange for admission to trading on the Main Market for listed securities (together, \"Admission\"). Admission is expected to occur on or around 12 June 2025.\nFollowing Admission, the Company's issued share capital will consist of 217,741,361 ordinary shares of 0.1p each, each with one voting right. The Company does not hold any shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 217,741,361.

Throughout 2024, we advanced our portfolio of exploration projects in Ontario with encouraging results and took deliberate steps to strengthen the Company's long-term outlook. This year was marked by the development of existing key projects, new partnerships, and active portfolio refinement, all underpinned by a cautiously optimistic approach in a favourable market for our commodities.\nOperational Highlights and Project Development:\nFCM's exploration activities in 2024 yielded substantial developments across our key properties. At our flagship\nNorth Hemlo (Dead Otter)\nproject, we built on the gold discovery announced in the previous year and increased our understanding of the\nDead Otter gold trend.\nFollow-up work, including stripping and channel sampling along this trend provided a greater geological understanding. These results have reinforced our confidence that Dead Otter represents a\nhigh-profile gold target\nwith considerable upside. Similarly, at the\nSunbeam Gold Project,\nour work programmes delivered positive outcomes. In early 2024 we reported values up to 18.8 g/t Au fro",

In particular, the Hemlo 'camp' near Marathon, Ontario is a proven world class address for gold exploration, featuring the Hemlo gold deposit operated by Barrick Gold (>23M oz gold produced), with the past producing Geco and Winston Lake base metal deposits also situated in the region.\nFCM currently holds 100% ownership of seven claim blocks covering over 180km\u00b2 along a 150km strike of the Hemlo-Schreiber-Dayohessarah greenstone belt, exploring for gold, base metals, and rare earth element mineralization. In addition, FCM is carrying out a joint venture with Palladium One on the West Pickle Lake Property in the region, a drill-proven ultra-high-grade Ni-Cu project.\nThe flagship property North Hemlo had a high-definition low level magnetic Heli-borne survey flown in April 2022, this was followed with ground prospecting which ultimately defined the 'Dead Otter Trend' which is a discontinuous 4.5km gold anomalous trend with a 19.6g/t Au peak grab sample. This sampling being the highest known assay ever recorded on the North Limb of Hemlo.\nIn October 2022 FCM completed the option to purchase the historical high-grade past-producing Sunbeam gold mine near Atikokan, Ontario, ~15 km southeast of Agnico Eagle's Hammond Reef gold deposit (3.3 Moz of open pit probable gold reserves).\nFCM acquired the Zigzag Project near Armstrong, Ontario in March 2023. The property features Li-Ta-bearing pegmatites in the same belt as Green Technology Metals' Seymour Lake Project, which contains a Mineral Resource estimate of 9.9 Mt @ 1.04% Li2O. Zigzag was drilled prior to Christmas 2023 and results have now been released.\nThe significant potential of the properties for precious, base and battery metals relates to 'nearology', since all properties lie in the same districts as known deposits (Hemlo, Hammond Reef, Seymour Lake), and either contain known showings, geochemical or geophysical anomalies, or favourable structures along strike from known showings (e.g. the Esa project, with an inferred Hemlo-style shear along strike from known gold occurrences).\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFIRST CLASS METALS PLC\n20 January 2025\nExploration Progress 2024 Season\nFirst Class Metals PLC (\"First Class Metals\" \"FCM\"\nor the\n\"Company\")\nthe UK listed company focused on the discovery of economic metal deposits across its exploration properties in Ontario, Canada is pleased to provide an exploration update for the work conducted in 2024 field season.\nExploration Programme Highlights\n\u00b7\nGold (Au) results from the stripping channel samples, combined with the completion of the soil sampling programme at North Hemlo, have increased the potential width of gold anomalism along the\nDead Otter trend (DOT) to approximately 30m\n, reinforcing its significance along its\n>3km strike length\n. Notably, high-grade grab samples include\n19.6 g/t Au and 13.6 g/t Au\n.\n\u00b7\nA review of historical drill core from the Sunbeam property, including TerraX (former claim owner) core,\nsupports the gold anomalism in the host porphyry theory\nas reported in the 1 February 2024 RNS.\nhttps://firstclassmetalsplc.com/announcements/6183576\nThe analysis highlights a\nsignificant 10m+ alteration halo\nsurrounding high-grade intersections, expanding the target zone. Notable historical drill results include\nHole 57751, which returned 19.4 g/t Au over 0.63m from 5.33m and 15.17 g/t Au over 1.37m from 21.44m\n.\n\u00b7\nPatterson Grant Watson (PGW) has been commissioned to interpret the\nmagnetic geophysical survey\nflown in\nlate summer 2024\nat the\nKerrs Gold Project\n. The interpretation aims to develop drill targets for the potential expansion of the\nhistorical NI 43-101 resource\n, which currently stands at\n7.04 Mt at 1.71 g/t Au for 386,467 oz Au (Inferred, using a 0.5 g/t cut-off grade).\n\u00b7\nBuilding on the success of the 2024 exploration program, a winter work program announced on 23 December 2024 has commenced, featuring lake sediment sampling at the\nNorth Hemlo\nand\nthe extended Sunbeam property\n, along with a\nVery Low Frequency (\nVLF)\nsurvey at North Hemlo, aimed at identifying / refining exploration targets and unlocking further potential.\n\u00b7\nGT Resources (TSXV: GT1) has applied for exploration permits over their Tyko block, which includes the\nWest Pickle Lake JV\n, a high-grade nickel sulphide discovery.\nMarc J. Sale CEO First Class Metals Commented:\n\"The 2024 field season was very much a year of consolidation for FCM in which we advanced both North Hemlo and Sunbeam as well as acquiring the Kerrs gold project. The potential of both the former is still considered significant and work conducted forms a firm basis for further work. The advance of North Hemlo and Sunbeam will be the focus of this year's field work.\nWith assured funding secured from the Seventy\nNinth Group and an enhanced understanding of the geology at our flagship properties, FCM is poised to launch a comprehensive and targeted exploration programme on these key assets in 2025. This robust foundation also enables us to advance satellite projects like Esa and Kerrs, driving our growth and unlocking their full potential\"\nNorth Hemlo Exploration geochemistry update:\n\u00b7\nSoil sampling at North Hemlo has increased the potential width of the gold anomalism of the Dead Otter trend.\n\u00b7\nStrong support from pathfinder elements, particularly molybdenum, similar to that found at the\nBarrick Hemlo Gold Mine\n, highlighting the expanding potential of the trend.\n\u00b7\nStructural review\nof the Dead Otter trend planned.\n\u00b7\nWinter field work - Lake sediment sampling and\nVery Low Frequency (VLF)\nsurvey over targets in North Hemlo initiated\n\u00b7\nGT Resources (TSXV: GT1) has applied for exploration permits over their Tyko block, which includes the\nWest Pickle Lake JV\n, a high-grade nickel sulphide discovery.\nExploration of the Dead Otter trend was the focus of activities in 2024 on the North Hemlo block of claims. Work included the stripping at three locations (one area subsequently extended) soil sampling in the vicinity of the three stripped areas as well a further prospecting around the 2.3ppm Au sample (a stripped locality).\nGold\nassay\nresults from the channel samples, as well as the base metal values, including additional channels cut at the Dead Otter and 19 grammer showing, have all been received. It is encouraging that most samples are anomalous to highly anomalous in gold, though no values exceeded one ppm (1 g/t). Given the high grades in previous grab samples (see figure 1) and the fact that the Photon assay results validated those grabs it furt",

What the Core Looks Like The core is dark, fine-grained, and strongly banded, with: Well-developed foliation (the streaky, planar fabric running along the core) Alternating light and dark bands Some brittle fracturing but no obvious thick quartz veining Patchy silica flooding and lighter bleached sections Thin red pencil lines marking meterage, not mineralization This is very typical of Hemlo-style host rocks, which are famously highly deformed, silicified, and sericite\u2013rich volcanic and sedimentary units. What Rock Type This Most Likely Is The core strongly resembles: Hemlo Sericite\u2013Silica Schist (the classic Hemlo host lithology) Characterised by: Dark grey to black colour Strong planar foliation Silica flooding Often pyrite-bearing (though it may be very fine and not visible in a photo) At Hemlo, gold occurs almost entirely within sericite\u2013silica altered schists, not big quartz veins. So this type of rock is considered favourable host rock. What the Textures Mean 1. Strong Foliation / Banding Indicates: High degree of deformation Shear zone or structural corridor Exactly the environments where Hemlo-style gold deposits form 2. Bleached or Light Bands These light zones represent: Silicification Sericite alteration Both are key alteration signatures at the Hemlo deposit. 3. Dark Massive Zones Likely: More mafic volcanics or sediment-derived units Less altered but still within the deformation zone 4. Fractured Core Normal for competent silica-rich rocks; not an indicator of mineralization by itself. Is There Visible Gold or Sulphide in the Photo? No visible gold or obvious coarse sulphides appear in this image. That is not surprising \u2014 Hemlo gold is notoriously \u201cinvisible\u201d, locked within extremely fine-grained sulphide or alteration minerals. Even high-grade Hemlo ore often shows: No quartz veining No visible gold Very fine pyrite or arsenopyrite only detectable under a microscope So lack of visible sulphides \u2260 lack of gold potential. Does This Look Like Good Core? For North Hemlo? Yes \u2014 it is promising host rock. Why: Strong deformation Silica\u2013sericite alteration Classic Hemlo-style stratigraphy Hemlo mineralization does not require quartz veins or obvious sulphides This is the type of rock you want to see before assays come back. What This Core Suggests About FCM\u2019s Target This interval appears to lie in: A deformation zone Within altered volcanic/sedimentary units similar to those at the Hemlo deposit Potentially in the right structural",

That\u2019s a rise of over 100 per cent in the last few months. Li shortfall now predicted for 2026 rather than 2028. Second Li trend confirmed and third suspected. ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can! Excitement definitely returning here.",

In the RNS (now 11 days ago) Fcm confirmed that the intention was to recommence drilling last week to complete the planned programme before Christmas. We know already that they were talking about \u2018surpassing\u2019 the planned meterage (700m). They should be pretty much finished in the next day or two if not already? Fcm confirmed that \u201c the geological features observed to date reinforce our confidence in the Dead Otter trend as a compelling gold target within the North Hemlo Project. We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year\u201d. So, whilst no assays yet (200 samples have already gone to Actlabs), the team are clearly liking what they see in the core. The terminology used suggests a pretty high degree of confidence in what the lab analysis might show. In addition, although this is a pilot or \u2018first pass\u2019 drill programme, I am especially pleased to see that they have the confidence to exceed the meterage before any assays are received confirming that they are positive for au. Again, this tends to reaffirm that high degree of confidence, as dd drilling at even near surface is a costly exercise especially in the relatively high risk world of a first or maiden drill programme on a project area. Can\u2019t wait for first results.",

A 10 hole average at best therefore would give us around 75 to 80 metres actual length for each, with true depth obviously less with  how much so depending on angle of entry (variously -70 to -45 ). A 80m hole at -70 entry for example would give true depth of X = 80 x sine 70 which is 80 x 0.9397 for 75.18 m. The same meterage of 80 but at -45 would give a shallower 55.57m.

Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

The similarities are striking\u2026.and the outcrop sample at surface returned 19.6 g/t!!!! This is a first pass (pilot) drill programme at North Hemlo and we may have struck gold!!!

A 75m hole at say 60 degrees angle of inclination would give true depth as 75 x Cosine 60. Cos 60 = 0.5, so true depth is 75 x 0. 5 so 37.5m. I have used 60 degrees from a visual on that drill image they showed us. It wasn\u2019t straight vertical at 90, nor did it appear at 45 degrees which would have been shallower for a 75m hole so I am guessing on 60 degrees. I doubt they would want to go shallower, and 700m limits total meterage so I reckon your 75 m actual length is about right. 10 holes would make it 750m so unless they have decided to extend campaign pre-assay, which I doubt, the drilling must be finished by tomorrow or perhaps Saturday.

MS seemed pretty happy about things at the conference last week so honestly can\u2019t wait for assays which I guess will be early new year as so close to Christmas now. Just got fot wait as they say hereabouts.",

External groups express surprise at the current undervaluation, given the scale of assets, ongoing work, and exploration progress. Share Price Context Two years ago, the share price was nearly 10\u00d7 higher, peaking around 1.8p, compared to today\u2019s level. Since then, the company has advanced multiple projects, making the current valuation appear disconnected from operational achievements. Operational Progress (Last Two Years) Zigzag \u2013 Successfully drilled, confirming lithium mineralisation. Lithium price environment appears to have bottomed and is beginning to strengthen, improving sector sentiment. Acquisition of KERRS, adding 386,000 compliant ounces to the company\u2019s resource base. Active drilling at North Hemlo underway. If there is a gold showing we prove the concept. Planned drilling at the Sunbeam area scheduled next. Strategic Positioning & Neighbouring Activity At North Hemlo, First Class Metals directly borders Hemlo Mining Corporation, which acquired Hemlo from Barrick. Both Hemlo Mining Corporation and Barrick have shown interest, with Barrick having visited the property multiple times. At Sunbeam the company is positioned between two active areas. First Class Metals is fully surrounded by active claims, highlighting the strategic importance of its land package and the high prospectivity of the region. Value Upside & Outlook Combination of a compliant resource, ongoing drilling, upcoming programs, and increased neighbour activity creates a strong value catalyst pipeline. The company is positioned for significant upside as exploration progresses and market sentiment improves. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBt4gDR2BWk",

Veining & Silica Flooding \u2013 Strongly Hemlo-Like Hemlo deposits are famous for: * Thick quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multi-generation silica flooding * Transposed and sheared vein networks The FCM core exhibits: * Long, continuous, strongly developed quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multiple overprinting events, including late-stage brecciation * Sustained silica flooding over tens of metres These are hallmark structural and hydrothermal features of Hemlo-style mineralisation. Verdict: \u2714 *Veining architecture is directly comparable to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing vein systems.* --- # \ud83d\udd36 2. Presence of Coarse Sulphides \u2013 A Major Hemlo Analogy Hemlo gold is intimately associated with: * Pyrite (fine to coarse) * Molybdenite in streaks and blebs * Local chalcopyrite and sphalerite * Sulphide-rich selvages around quartz\u2013carbonate veins The updated information \u2014 coarse sulphides throughout the FCM interval \u2014 is highly significant. FCM core shows: * Thick coarse sulphide bands and clusters * Strong sulphide\u2013silica association * Sulphides concentrated along high-strain planes * Disseminated sulphides within altered host rocks This level and grain size of sulphidation is far more characteristic of productive zones within the Hemlo system than initially assumed. Verdict: \u2714 *Coarse sulphides dramatically increase the similarity to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing horizons.* \u2714 *This is no longer \u201cupper, weakly sulphidic Hemlo-style\u201d \u2014 this moves into the range of potentially fertile mineralised corridors.* --- # \ud83d\udd36 3. Structural Preparation \u2013 Classic Hemlo-Style Shear Zone Geology Hemlo gold occurs in polyphase ductile shear zones, producing: * Mylonitic fabrics * Sheared porphyry and basalt * Repeated deformation of silica veins The FCM core displays: * High-strain fabrics throughout the interval * Shear banding cutting major veins * Quartz\u2013carbonate lenses dragged into the foliation * Sulphides aligned along deformation planes These are textbook ingredients for Archean lode gold mineralisation and match Hemlo\u2019s structural style extremely well. Verdict: \u2714 *The deformation intensity and geometry are strikingly consistent with Hemlo's ore-hosting shear sequences.* --- # \ud83d\udd36 4. Alteration \u2013 Consistent With Hemlo\u2019s Hydrothermal Signature Typical Hemlo alteration includes: * Silica\u2013carbonate flooding * Sericite\u2013silica halos * Hematite streaking",

          "content": "I used GROK for this one----- Geological look at the drill core (north limb of Hemlo belt, ~15 km north of the Barrick Hemlo mine): The interval shows a genuine quartz-feldspar porphyry with clear quartz eyes and feldspar phenocrysts, sitting on a major shear zone on the north limb of the Hemlo greenstone belt. This setup is a strong geological analogue to the rocks that host gold at Hemlo. Quick comparison to Hemlo: Structural position \u2013 Hemlo sits on a major D2 shear on the north limb; this hole is on a parallel major shear but 15 km to the north. Host rock \u2013 Hemlo uses quartz-feldspar porphyry with quartz eyes; this interval shows the same rock type. Core appearance \u2013 Hemlo core is light grey, sheared, with quartz stockwork; this interval looks the same with shearing and quartz veining. Alteration \u2013 Hemlo shows silicification, potassic alteration, and pyrite; this interval shows similar silicification and quartz stockwork with fine pyrite expected. Mineralisation style \u2013 Hemlo gold is fine-grained in pyrite within sheared porphyry; the same style is expected here. Regional context \u2013 Hemlo has multiple showings along the north limb; this hole is further north but still within the broader Hemlo structural-stratigraphic framework. Why this matters: Quartz-feldspar porphyry with quartz eyes is the key Hemlo host and has produced over 27 Moz. Being in a parallel shear on the same limb means the geology is capable of hosting Hemlo-style gold. Hemlo gold is rarely visible; assays normally reveal it, and even 1\u20134 g/t over a few metres can be significant in this environment. Bottom line: This interval shows classic Hemlo-type host rocks and structures but in a northern structural segment about 15 km from the main mine. It is not the same corridor, but it shares the same recipe: sheared porphyry, quartz eyes, quartz stockwork, and a north-limb shear. Assays will determine the significance, but the geology suggests real potential for a Hemlo-style shoot in this northern position.",

Multiple deformed structures, sheared contacts, clasts, veining and coarse sulphides on a parallel shear 15 km from Hemlo all fit the broader Hemlo camp exploration model and are exactly the kinds of features companies look for when hunting \u201canother Hemlo\u201d along trend.[1][2] ## Why this looks encouraging - Being on a parallel shear close to a long\u2011lived, high\u2011grade camp like Barrick Hemlo immediately upgrades the geological risk profile; this is the right neighbourhood and the right structural setting.[3][1] - Strong deformation, veining and coarse sulphide mineralization together indicate a vigorous fluid system, which is a key ingredient in significant gold deposits in the Hemlo district.[4][1] - Other explorers north of Hemlo are actively drilling similar structural targets, and the market generally views any Hemlo\u2011style sulphidic shear intersections as high\u2011impact catalysts due to the camp\u2019s tier\u2011one pedigree.[2][5] Bullish framing - The combination of structure, veining and sulphides 15 km north of a world\u2011class mine can be credibly framed as a potential satellite or analogue system along the same mineralized corridor.[1][3] - Until assays are back, the geology alone already supports a speculative, discovery\u2011upside narrative: this is the kind of core that justifies follow\u2011up drilling, more aggressive step\u2011outs and heightened investor interest.[5][2] [1]( https://portergeo.com.au/database/mineinfo.php?mineid=mn088) [2]( https://www.rockyshoregold.com/files/rsg_2025q4_mda.pdf) [3]( https://prd-0420-geoontario-0000-blob-cge0eud7azhvfsf7.z01.azurefd.net/lrc-geology-documents/publication/OFR5977/OFR5977.pdf) [4]( https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/economicgeology/article-pdf/96/3/477/3494101/p0477-p0507.pdf) [5]( https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/FCM/drilling-commenced-at-north-hemlo/17331451)",

Veining & Silica Flooding \u2013 Strongly Hemlo-Like Hemlo deposits are famous for: * Thick quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multi-generation silica flooding * Transposed and sheared vein networks The FCM core exhibits: * Long, continuous, strongly developed quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multiple overprinting events, including late-stage brecciation * Sustained silica flooding over tens of metres These are hallmark structural and hydrothermal features of Hemlo-style mineralisation. Verdict: \u2714 *Veining architecture is directly comparable to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing vein systems.* --- #  2. Presence of Coarse Sulphides \u2013 A Major Hemlo Analogy Hemlo gold is intimately associated with: * Pyrite (fine to coarse) * Molybdenite in streaks and blebs * Local chalcopyrite and sphalerite * Sulphide-rich selvages around quartz\u2013carbonate veins The updated information \u2014 coarse sulphides throughout the FCM interval \u2014 is highly significant. FCM core shows: * Thick coarse sulphide bands and clusters * Strong sulphide\u2013silica association * Sulphides concentrated along high-strain planes * Disseminated sulphides within altered host rocks This level and grain size of sulphidation is far more characteristic of productive zones within the Hemlo system than initially assumed. Verdict: \u2714 *Coarse sulphides dramatically increase the similarity to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing horizons.* \u2714 *This is no longer \u201cupper, weakly sulphidic Hemlo-style\u201d \u2014 this moves into the range of potentially fertile mineralised corridors.* --- #  3. Structural Preparation \u2013 Classic Hemlo-Style Shear Zone Geology Hemlo gold occurs in polyphase ductile shear zones, producing: * Mylonitic fabrics * Sheared porphyry and basalt * Repeated deformation of silica veins The FCM core displays: * High-strain fabrics throughout the interval * Shear banding cutting major veins * Quartz\u2013carbonate lenses dragged into the foliation * Sulphides aligned along deformation planes These are textbook ingredients for Archean lode gold mineralisation and match Hemlo\u2019s structural style extremely well. Verdict: \u2714 *The deformation intensity and geometry are strikingly consistent with Hemlo's ore-hosting shear sequences.* --- #  4. Alteration \u2013 Consistent With Hemlo\u2019s Hydrothermal Signature Typical Hemlo alteration includes: * Silica\u2013carbonate flooding * Sericite\u2013silica halos * Hematite streaking in places * Feldspar destructive alteration FCM core shows * Pervasive silica\u2013carbonate alteration * Pale alteration envelopes around veins * Local sericitic textures * Strong correlati",

What the Core Looks Like The core is dark, fine-grained, and strongly banded, with: Well-developed foliation (the streaky, planar fabric running along the core) Alternating light and dark bands Some brittle fracturing but no obvious thick quartz veining Patchy silica flooding and lighter bleached sections Thin red pencil lines marking meterage, not mineralization This is very typical of Hemlo-style host rocks, which are famously highly deformed, silicified, and sericite\u2013rich volcanic and sedimentary units. What Rock Type This Most Likely Is The core strongly resembles: Hemlo Sericite\u2013Silica Schist (the classic Hemlo host lithology) Characterised by: Dark grey to black colour Strong planar foliation Silica flooding Often pyrite-bearing (though it may be very fine and not visible in a photo) At Hemlo, gold occurs almost entirely within sericite\u2013silica altered schists, not big quartz veins. So this type of rock is considered favourable host rock. What the Textures Mean 1. Strong Foliation / Banding Indicates: High degree of deformation Shear zone or structural corridor Exactly the environments where Hemlo-style gold deposits form 2. Bleached or Light Bands These light zones represent: Silicification Sericite alteration Both are key alteration signatures at the Hemlo deposit. 3. Dark Massive Zones Likely: More mafic volcanics or sediment-derived units Less altered but still within the deformation zone 4. Fractured Core Normal for competent silica-rich rocks; not an indicator of mineralization by itself. Is There Visible Gold or Sulphide in the Photo? No visible gold or obvious coarse sulphides appear in this image. That is not surprising \u2014 Hemlo gold is notoriously \u201cinvisible\u201d, locked within extremely fine-grained sulphide or alteration minerals. Even high-grade Hemlo ore often shows: No quartz veining No visible gold Very fine pyrite or arsenopyrite only detectable under a microscope So lack of visible sulphides \u2260 lack of gold potential. Does This Look Like Good Core? For North Hemlo? Yes \u2014 it is promising host rock. Why: Strong deformation Silica\u2013sericite alteration Classic Hemlo-style stratigraphy Hemlo mineralization does not require quartz veins or obvious sulphides This is the type of rock you want to see before assays come back. What This Core Suggests About FCM\u2019s Target This interval appears to lie in: A deformation zone Within altered volcanic/sedimentary units similar to those at the Hemlo deposit Potentially in the right structural",

That\u2019s a rise of over 100 per cent in the last few months. Li shortfall now predicted for 2026 rather than 2028. Second Li trend confirmed and third suspected. ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can! Excitement definitely returning here.",

In the RNS (now 11 days ago) Fcm confirmed that the intention was to recommence drilling last week to complete the planned programme before Christmas. We know already that they were talking about \u2018surpassing\u2019 the planned meterage (700m). They should be pretty much finished in the next day or two if not already? Fcm confirmed that \u201c the geological features observed to date reinforce our confidence in the Dead Otter trend as a compelling gold target within the North Hemlo Project. We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year\u201d. So, whilst no assays yet (200 samples have already gone to Actlabs), the team are clearly liking what they see in the core. The terminology used suggests a pretty high degree of confidence in what the lab analysis might show. In addition, although this is a pilot or \u2018first pass\u2019 drill programme, I am especially pleased to see that they have the confidence to exceed the meterage before any assays are received confirming that they are positive for au. Again, this tends to reaffirm that high degree of confidence, as dd drilling at even near surface is a costly exercise especially in the relatively high risk world of a first or maiden drill programme on a project area. Can\u2019t wait for first results.",

Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

Strong silica flooding / quartz-rich fabric The pale, translucent groundmass indicates a quartz-dominant interval\u2014likely a vein or a silica-altered zone. That alone is significant, as quartz veining is the primary host for orogenic gold in Archean terranes. 2. A distinct dark, rusty-brown mineralised band The darker zone with rusty-orange oxidation suggests the presence of sulphides (pyrite/pyrrhotite, possibly chalcopyrite). This rusty halo is exactly what you\u2019d expect where sulphides have weathered on a cut surface. Why this matters: sulphides mark fluid flow fluid flow is where gold precipitates in these systems 3. A clear structural fabric The angled band relative to the core axis implies the blade is cutting across a vein, shear, or foliation. Such structural contrasts often represent important fluid pathways. 4. Sharp, planar contact The clean boundary suggests this is a genuine structural or veined feature\u2014not random patchy alteration\u2014making it far more meaningful from an exploration standpoint. Overall Interpretation This small section of core appears to capture: Silica-rich veining or strong quartz flooding A sulphide-bearing interval now oxidised to rusty brown A well-defined structural feature This is precisely the style of material that matters in Archean greenstone-hosted gold systems.

People often make the mistake of thinking initial drilling is straightforward. Nothing could be further from the truth, and that is why a positive result would be so significant for us.

A 75m hole at say 60 degrees angle of inclination would give true depth as 75 x Cosine 60. Cos 60 = 0.5, so true depth is 75 x 0. 5 so 37.5m. I have used 60 degrees from a visual on that drill image they showed us. It wasn\u2019t straight vertical at 90, nor did it appear at 45 degrees which would have been shallower for a 75m hole so I am guessing on 60 degrees. I doubt they would want to go shallower, and 700m limits total meterage so I reckon your 75 m actual length is about right. 10 holes would make it 750m so unless they have decided to extend campaign pre-assay, which I doubt, the drilling must be finished by tomorrow or perhaps Saturday.

External groups express surprise at the current undervaluation, given the scale of assets, ongoing work, and exploration progress. Share Price Context Two years ago, the share price was nearly 10\u00d7 higher, peaking around 1.8p, compared to today\u2019s level. Since then, the company has advanced multiple projects, making the current valuation appear disconnected from operational achievements. Operational Progress (Last Two Years) Zigzag \u2013 Successfully drilled, confirming lithium mineralisation. Lithium price environment appears to have bottomed and is beginning to strengthen, improving sector sentiment. Acquisition of KERRS, adding 386,000 compliant ounces to the company\u2019s resource base. Active drilling at North Hemlo underway. If there is a gold showing we prove the concept. Planned drilling at the Sunbeam area scheduled next. Strategic Positioning & Neighbouring Activity At North Hemlo, First Class Metals directly borders Hemlo Mining Corporation, which acquired Hemlo from Barrick. Both Hemlo Mining Corporation and Barrick have shown interest, with Barrick having visited the property multiple times. At Sunbeam the company is positioned between two active areas. First Class Metals is fully surrounded by active claims, highlighting the strategic importance of its land package and the high prospectivity of the region. Value Upside & Outlook Combination of a compliant resource, ongoing drilling, upcoming programs, and increased neighbour activity creates a strong value catalyst pipeline. The company is positioned for significant upside as exploration progresses and market sentiment improves. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBt4gDR2BWk",

Veining & Silica Flooding \u2013 Strongly Hemlo-Like Hemlo deposits are famous for: * Thick quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multi-generation silica flooding * Transposed and sheared vein networks The FCM core exhibits: * Long, continuous, strongly developed quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multiple overprinting events, including late-stage brecciation * Sustained silica flooding over tens of metres These are hallmark structural and hydrothermal features of Hemlo-style mineralisation. Verdict: \u2714 *Veining architecture is directly comparable to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing vein systems.* --- # \ud83d\udd36 2. Presence of Coarse Sulphides \u2013 A Major Hemlo Analogy Hemlo gold is intimately associated with: * Pyrite (fine to coarse) * Molybdenite in streaks and blebs * Local chalcopyrite and sphalerite * Sulphide-rich selvages around quartz\u2013carbonate veins The updated information \u2014 coarse sulphides throughout the FCM interval \u2014 is highly significant. FCM core shows: * Thick coarse sulphide bands and clusters * Strong sulphide\u2013silica association * Sulphides concentrated along high-strain planes * Disseminated sulphides within altered host rocks This level and grain size of sulphidation is far more characteristic of productive zones within the Hemlo system than initially assumed. Verdict: \u2714 *Coarse sulphides dramatically increase the similarity to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing horizons.* \u2714 *This is no longer \u201cupper, weakly sulphidic Hemlo-style\u201d \u2014 this moves into the range of potentially fertile mineralised corridors.* --- # \ud83d\udd36 3. Structural Preparation \u2013 Classic Hemlo-Style Shear Zone Geology Hemlo gold occurs in polyphase ductile shear zones, producing: * Mylonitic fabrics * Sheared porphyry and basalt * Repeated deformation of silica veins The FCM core displays: * High-strain fabrics throughout the interval * Shear banding cutting major veins * Quartz\u2013carbonate lenses dragged into the foliation * Sulphides aligned along deformation planes These are textbook ingredients for Archean lode gold mineralisation and match Hemlo\u2019s structural style extremely well. Verdict: \u2714 *The deformation intensity and geometry are strikingly consistent with Hemlo's ore-hosting shear sequences.* --- # \ud83d\udd36 4. Alteration \u2013 Consistent With Hemlo\u2019s Hydrothermal Signature Typical Hemlo alteration includes: * Silica\u2013carbonate flooding * Sericite\u2013silica halos * Hematite streaking",

          "content": "I used GROK for this one----- Geological look at the drill core (north limb of Hemlo belt, ~15 km north of the Barrick Hemlo mine): The interval shows a genuine quartz-feldspar porphyry with clear quartz eyes and feldspar phenocrysts, sitting on a major shear zone on the north limb of the Hemlo greenstone belt. This setup is a strong geological analogue to the rocks that host gold at Hemlo. Quick comparison to Hemlo: Structural position \u2013 Hemlo sits on a major D2 shear on the north limb; this hole is on a parallel major shear but 15 km to the north. Host rock \u2013 Hemlo uses quartz-feldspar porphyry with quartz eyes; this interval shows the same rock type. Core appearance \u2013 Hemlo core is light grey, sheared, with quartz stockwork; this interval looks the same with shearing and quartz veining. Alteration \u2013 Hemlo shows silicification, potassic alteration, and pyrite; this interval shows similar silicification and quartz stockwork with fine pyrite expected. Mineralisation style \u2013 Hemlo gold is fine-grained in pyrite within sheared porphyry; the same style is expected here. Regional context \u2013 Hemlo has multiple showings along the north limb; this hole is further north but still within the broader Hemlo structural-stratigraphic framework. Why this matters: Quartz-feldspar porphyry with quartz eyes is the key Hemlo host and has produced over 27 Moz. Being in a parallel shear on the same limb means the geology is capable of hosting Hemlo-style gold. Hemlo gold is rarely visible; assays normally reveal it, and even 1\u20134 g/t over a few metres can be significant in this environment. Bottom line: This interval shows classic Hemlo-type host rocks and structures but in a northern structural segment about 15 km from the main mine. It is not the same corridor, but it shares the same recipe: sheared porphyry, quartz eyes, quartz stockwork, and a north-limb shear. Assays will determine the significance, but the geology suggests real potential for a Hemlo-style shoot in this northern position.",

          "content": "#  Independent-Style Comparison: FCM Core vs. Barrick Hemlo Core (Revised for Coarse Sulphides) If a geologist unfamiliar with First Class Metals were asked: > \u201cDoes this core look comparable to Hemlo core?\u201d \u2014here is the type of balanced but strongly positive assessment they could give: --- # 1. Veining & Silica Flooding \u2013 Strongly Hemlo-Like Hemlo deposits are famous for: * Thick quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multi-generation silica flooding * Transposed and sheared vein networks The FCM core exhibits: * Long, continuous, strongly developed quartz\u2013carbonate veins * Multiple overprinting events, including late-stage brecciation * Sustained silica flooding over tens of metres These are hallmark structural and hydrothermal features of Hemlo-style mineralisation. Verdict: \u2714 *Veining architecture is directly comparable to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing vein systems.* --- #  2. Presence of Coarse Sulphides \u2013 A Major Hemlo Analogy Hemlo gold is intimately associated with: * Pyrite (fine to coarse) * Molybdenite in streaks and blebs * Local chalcopyrite and sphalerite * Sulphide-rich selvages around quartz\u2013carbonate veins The updated information \u2014 coarse sulphides throughout the FCM interval \u2014 is highly significant. FCM core shows: * Thick coarse sulphide bands and clusters * Strong sulphide\u2013silica association * Sulphides concentrated along high-strain planes * Disseminated sulphides within altered host rocks This level and grain size of sulphidation is far more characteristic of productive zones within the Hemlo system than initially assumed. Verdict: \u2714 *Coarse sulphides dramatically increase the similarity to Hemlo\u2019s gold-bearing horizons.* \u2714 *This is no longer \u201cupper, weakly sulphidic Hemlo-style\u201d \u2014 this moves into the range of potentially fertile mineralised corridors.* --- #  3. Structural Preparation \u2013 Classic Hemlo-Style Shear Zone Geology Hemlo gold occurs in polyphase ductile shear zones, producing: * Mylonitic fabrics * Sheared porphyry and basalt * Repeated deformation of silica veins The FCM core displays: * High-strain fabrics throughout the interval * Shear banding cutting major veins * Quartz\u2013carbonate lenses dragged into the foliation * Sulphides aligned along deformation planes These are textbook ingredients for Archean lode gold mineralisation and match Hemlo\u2019s structural style extremely well. Verdict: \u2714 *The deformation intensity and geometry are strikingly consistent with Hemlo's ore-hosting shear sequences.* --- #  4. Alteration \u2013 Consistent With Hemlo\u2019s Hydrothermal Signature Typical Hemlo alteration includes: * Silica\u2013carbonate flooding * Sericite\u2013silica halos * Hematite streaking in places * Feldspar destructive alteration FCM core shows * Pervasive silica\u2013carbonate alteration * Pale alteration envelopes around veins * Local sericitic textures * Strong correlati",

What the Core Looks Like The core is dark, fine-grained, and strongly banded, with: Well-developed foliation (the streaky, planar fabric running along the core) Alternating light and dark bands Some brittle fracturing but no obvious thick quartz veining Patchy silica flooding and lighter bleached sections Thin red pencil lines marking meterage, not mineralization This is very typical of Hemlo-style host rocks, which are famously highly deformed, silicified, and sericite\u2013rich volcanic and sedimentary units. What Rock Type This Most Likely Is The core strongly resembles: Hemlo Sericite\u2013Silica Schist (the classic Hemlo host lithology) Characterised by: Dark grey to black colour Strong planar foliation Silica flooding Often pyrite-bearing (though it may be very fine and not visible in a photo) At Hemlo, gold occurs almost entirely within sericite\u2013silica altered schists, not big quartz veins. So this type of rock is considered favourable host rock. What the Textures Mean 1. Strong Foliation / Banding Indicates: High degree of deformation Shear zone or structural corridor Exactly the environments where Hemlo-style gold deposits form 2. Bleached or Light Bands These light zones represent: Silicification Sericite alteration Both are key alteration signatures at the Hemlo deposit. 3. Dark Massive Zones Likely: More mafic volcanics or sediment-derived units Less altered but still within the deformation zone 4. Fractured Core Normal for competent silica-rich rocks; not an indicator of mineralization by itself. Is There Visible Gold or Sulphide in the Photo? No visible gold or obvious coarse sulphides appear in this image. That is not surprising \u2014 Hemlo gold is notoriously \u201cinvisible\u201d, locked within extremely fine-grained sulphide or alteration minerals. Even high-grade Hemlo ore often shows: No quartz veining No visible gold Very fine pyrite or arsenopyrite only detectable under a microscope So lack of visible sulphides \u2260 lack of gold potential. Does This Look Like Good Core? For North Hemlo? Yes \u2014 it is promising host rock. Why: Strong deformation Silica\u2013sericite alteration Classic Hemlo-style stratigraphy Hemlo mineralization does not require quartz veins or obvious sulphides This is the type of rock you want to see before assays come back. What This Core Suggests About FCM\u2019s Target This interval appears to lie in: A deformation zone Within altered volcanic/sedimentary units similar to those at the Hemlo deposit Potentially in the right structural",

ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can! Excitement definitely returning here.",

          "content": "Interesting to see that new neighbours Hemlo Mining Corporation are continuing to bolster its Senior Leadership Team. Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

Programme highlights 10 diamond drill holes completed ~3km of strike tested along the Dead Otter trend Drilling exceeded contracted metres Visually prospective geology in every hole Deformation, quartz veining & sulphides consistent with a Hemlo-style gold system 300+ samples already dispatched for assay Location matters North Hemlo sits in the world-class Hemlo Greenstone Belt (>23Moz Au produced). With Barrick\u2019s US$1.09bn exit from Hemlo completed earlier this month, the district is firmly back in focus \u2014 and FCM\u2019s Dead Otter trend lies directly alongside the new operator\u2019s ground. Multiple gold styles remain in play, including: \u2022 Shear-hosted orogenic gold \u2022 Structurally controlled mineralisation at greenstone\u2013granite contacts Assays will determine grade, but geology underpins value \u2014 and the geological evidence supports continued confidence in the Dead Otter trend. #FCM https://firstclassmetalsplc.com/announcements/7318908 https://x.com/i/status/2003370543559397745",

As such, and as risk factors would come very much into play in a \u2018first pass\u2019, I would argue not more than between 50 to 100m. A 10 hole average at best therefore would give us around 75 to 80 metres actual length for each, with true depth obviously less with  how much so depending on angle of entry (variously -70 to -45 ). A 80m hole at -70 entry for example would give true depth of X = 80 x sine 70 which is 80 x 0.9397 for 75.18 m. The same meterage of 80 but at -45 would give a shallower 55.57m.

We know already that they were talking about \u2018surpassing\u2019 the planned meterage (700m). They should be pretty much finished in the next day or two if not already? Fcm confirmed that \u201c the geological features observed to date reinforce our confidence in the Dead Otter trend as a compelling gold target within the North Hemlo Project. We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year\u201d. So, whilst no assays yet (200 samples have already gone to Actlabs), the team are clearly liking what they see in the core. The terminology used suggests a pretty high degree of confidence in what the lab analysis might show. In addition, although this is a pilot or \u2018first pass\u2019 drill programme, I am especially pleased to see that they have the confidence to exceed the meterage before any assays are received confirming that they are positive for au. Again, this tends to reaffirm that high degree of confidence, as dd drilling at even near surface is a costly exercise especially in the relatively high risk world of a first or maiden drill programme on a project area.

That\u2019s a rise of over 100 per cent in the last few months. Li shortfall now predicted for 2026 rather than 2028. Second Li trend confirmed and third suspected. ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can!

Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

In particular, the Hemlo 'camp' near Marathon, Ontario is a proven world class address for gold exploration, featuring the Hemlo gold deposit operated by Barrick Mining (>23M oz gold produced), with the past producing Geco and Winston Lake base metal deposits also situated in the region.\nFCM currently holds 100% ownership of seven claim blocks covering over 250km\u00b2 in northwest Ontario. A further three blocks are under option and cover an additional 30km2.FCM is focussed on exploring for gold but has base metals and critical metals mineralisation. FCM is maintaining a joint venture with GT Resources on the West Pickle Lake Property a drill-proven ultra-high-grade Ni-Cu project.\nThe flagship properties, North Hemlo and Sunbeam, are gold focussed. North Hemlo has a significant discovery in the Dead Otter trend which is a discontinuous 3.5km gold anomalous trend with a 19.6g/t Au peak grab sample. This sampling being the highest known assay from a grab sample ever recorded on the North Limb of Hemlo.\nIn October 2022 FCM completed the option to purchase the historical high-grade past-producing Sunbeam gold mine near Atikokan, Ontario, ~15 km southeast of Agnico Eagle's Hammond Reef gold deposit (3.3 Moz of open pit probable gold reserves).\nFCM acquired the Zigzag Project near Armstrong, Ontario in March 2023. The property features Li-Ta-bearing pegmatites in the same belt as Green Technology Metals' Seymour Lake Project, which contains a Mineral Resource estimate of 9.9 Mt @ 1.04% Li2O. Zigzag was successfully drilled prior to Christmas 2023 and results have now been released.\nThe Kerrs Gold property, acquired under option by First Class Metals in April 2024, is located in northeastern Ontario within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most prolific gold-producing regions. The project holds a historical inferred resource of approximately 386,000 ounces of gold, underscoring its potential as a meaningful addition to FCM's expanding gold portfolio. Kerrs Gold complements the Company's exploration strategy and provides exposure to a well-established mining district. FCM is currently reviewing plans to advance the project and further unlock its value.\nThe significant potential of the properties for precious, base and battery metals relates to 'nearology', since all properties lie in the same districts as known deposits (Hemlo, Hammond Reef, Seymour Lake), and either contain known showings, geochemical or geophysical anomalies, or favourable structures along strike from known showings (e.g. the Esa project, with an inferred Hemlo-style shear along strike from known gold occurrences).\nFor further information see the Company's presentation on the web site:\nfirstclassmetalsplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFIRST CLASS METALS PLC\n30 January 2026\nFunding & Corporate Update\nFirst Class Metals PLC (\n\"First Class Metals\", \"FCM\"\nor the\n\"Company\"\n), the UK-listed exploration company advancing high-grade, district-scale gold opportunities in Ontario, Canada, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a new interest-free Convertible Loan Note Instrument (\n\"CLN\"\nor the\n\"Convertible Loan Notes\"\n) with an international investor (the\n\"Investor\"\n) for up to \u00a31,000,000.\nHighlights and Funding Overview\n\u00b7\nThe Company has secured funding in order to advance its maiden drill programme on the Sunbeam Property and general working capital requirements.\n\u00b7\nUnder the terms of the CLN, the Investor has agreed to subscribe for up to \u00a31.0 million interest-free convertible loan notes of \u00a31 each, to be issued in tranches, with a twelve-month maturity from the date of the instrument.\n\u00b7\nThe first tranche of \u00a3350,000 has been agreed and is expected to be drawn shortly, with further tranches available in accordance with the terms of the CLN.\n\u00b7\nThe Convertible Loan Notes are interest-free and are convertible at the option of the Investor at a price equal to 82% of the lowest daily VWAP over the five trading days immediately prior to the submission of a conversion notice. Conversion of any outstanding balance is mandatory at maturity, subject to statutory shareholding limits.\n\u00b7\nThe Company retains the right, prior to maturity, to redeem the Convertible Loan Notes at 125% of their nominal value.\n\u00b7\nA 2% commitment fee is payable in respect of each tranche and may be offset against the subscription proceeds at drawdown.\n\u00b7\nThe CLN additionally provides the Investor with warrants for each tranche equalling to 35% of the convertible loan notes comprising that tranche (with a maximum of 350,000 warrants for the 1,000,000 loan notes). The subscription price for each warrant is 120% of the closing price of an ordinary share on the business day immediately preceding the day of the subscription of the tranche. The warrants will be exercisable at any time within three years from the date of grant.\n\u00b7\nIn connection with the subscription of the first tranche, the Company will issue 4,803,922 warrants exercisable at 2.55 pence per share.\n\u00b7\nPayment of final CAD$ 100,000 due to the Kerrs Gold property option holders to be made in order to acquire a 100% ownership of the Property.\nUse of Proceeds & Corporate Update\nThe proceeds of the Convertible Loan Notes will be used to initiate a drill programme at the Company's Sunbeam Property in Ontario, Canada and provide for general working capital requirements.\nOperationally, the location of the initial drill targets at Sunbeam requires hard-frozen ground conditions to ensure safe and effective access. These conditions are now present during the Ontario winter season, enabling the Company to advance drilling. A drill programme is currently being designed, and the Company will provide further updates on rig mobilisation and programme timing.\nIn addition, the Company is accelerating the final cash consideration of CAD$100,000 payable to the option holders of the Kerrs Gold Property. Upon completion of this payment, First Class Metals will hold a 100% ownership interest in the Kerrs Gold Property, which hosts a historical resource of approximately 386,000 ounces of gold.\nJames Knowles, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"This funding agreement is a deliberate and strategic step to ensure First Class Metals is fully capitalised to act decisively at a critical point in our operational calendar. The ability to advance programmes at the right time is fundamental to maximising value in an exploration-led business. Given the well-publicised move higher in gold prices to new all-time highs in the last few months, we believe now is the time to progress our portfolio on multiple fronts.\nAt the same time, the Company is completing the final steps to secure full ownership of the Kerrs Gold Property, a substantial gold asset with a defined 386,000-ounce gold resource. The Company felt this to be a prudent step considering market factors and ensuring the Company has the flexibility to make quick decisions in relation to the Property.\"\nFor Further Information:\nEngage with us by asking questions, watching video summaries, and seeing what other shareholders have to say.\nNavigate to our Interactive Investor hub here\n:\nhttps://firstclassmetalsplc.com\nFor further information, p",

New \u00a31,000,000 Convertible Loan Note (CLN) Facility** FCM has secured an interest\u2011free CLN agreement with an international investor, providing up to **\u00a31m** in staged tranches. **Key terms:** - **Interest\u2011free** (unusual and favourable on the surface). - **First tranche: \u00a3350,000**, expected to be drawn shortly. - **Conversion price:** - 82% of the **lowest daily VWAP** over the **5 days** before conversion. - This is a *variable\u2011price convertible* \u2014 often called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d structure if mismanaged. - **Mandatory conversion at maturity** (12 months), unless redeemed earlier. - **Company buy\u2011back option:** - FCM can redeem notes at **125%** of nominal value before maturity. - **Commitment fee:** 2% per tranche. - **Warrants:** - 35% of each tranche value. - Up to **350,000 warrants** total. - Strike price = 120% of the closing price before each tranche. - 3\u2011year life. - **First tranche warrants:** - **4,803,922 warrants @ 2.55p**. 2. Use of Proceeds** - Fund **maiden drill programme** at the **Sunbeam Property** (Ontario). - Provide **general working capital**. - Pay the final **CAD$100,000** to secure **100% ownership** of the **Kerrs Gold Property** (386,000 oz historical resource). 3. Operational Update** - Winter conditions now allow access to drill targets at Sunbeam. - Drill programme design underway; mobilisation updates to follow. - Kerrs Gold final payment will complete full ownership. --- \ud83d\udcca **What This Means for Shareholders** *\u2714 Positive Aspects** - Funding secured without traditional interest costs. - Enables drilling at a strategically important time (high gold prices). - Full ownership of Kerrs Gold strengthens the asset base. - Warrants priced at a premium (120%) \u2014 better than discounted warrants. *\u26a0 Dilution & Risk Considerations** This CLN is **highly dilutive** if converted: - Conversion at **82% of the lowest VWAP** is a *discounted variable\u2011price mechanism*. - If the share price weakens, conversion creates more shares \u2192 more dilution \u2192 further price pressure. - The 4.8m warrants at 2.55p add additional potential dilution. This structure is common for small-cap explorers but requires careful management to avoid a downward spiral.",

A 80m hole at -70 entry for example would give true depth of X = 80 x sine 70 which is 80 x 0.9397 for 75.18 m. The same meterage of 80 but at -45 would give a shallower 55.57m.

In the RNS (now 11 days ago) Fcm confirmed that the intention was to recommence drilling last week to complete the planned programme before Christmas. We know already that they were talking about \u2018surpassing\u2019 the planned meterage (700m). They should be pretty much finished in the next day or two if not already? Fcm confirmed that \u201c the geological features observed to date reinforce our confidence in the Dead Otter trend as a compelling gold target within the North Hemlo Project. We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year\u201d. So, whilst no assays yet (200 samples have already gone to Actlabs), the team are clearly liking what they see in the core. The terminology used suggests a pretty high degree of confidence in what the lab analysis might show. In addition, although this is a pilot or \u2018first pass\u2019 drill programme, I am especially pleased to see that they have the confidence to exceed the meterage before any assays are received confirming that they are positive for au. Again, this tends to reaffirm that high degree of confidence, as dd drilling at even near surface is a costly exercise especially in the relatively high risk world of a first or maiden drill programme on a project area. Can\u2019t wait for first results.",

That\u2019s a rise of over 100 per cent in the last few months. Li shortfall now predicted for 2026 rather than 2028. Second Li trend confirmed and third suspected. ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can! Excitement definitely returning here.",

          "content": "Interesting to see that new neighbours Hemlo Mining Corporation are continuing to bolster its Senior Leadership Team. Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

Multiple gold styles remain in play, including: \u2022 Shear-hosted orogenic gold \u2022 Structurally controlled mineralisation at greenstone\u2013granite contacts Assays will determine grade, but geology underpins value \u2014 and the geological evidence supports continued confidence in the Dead Otter trend. #FCM https://firstclassmetalsplc.com/announcements/7318908 https://x.com/i/status/2003370543559397745",

Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.\nUnder Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8 of the Code. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) of the Code applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. If two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Code.\nOpening Position Disclosures mus",

New \u00a31,000,000 Convertible Loan Note (CLN) Facility** FCM has secured an interest\u2011free CLN agreement with an international investor, providing up to **\u00a31m** in staged tranches. **Key terms:** - **Interest\u2011free** (unusual and favourable on the surface). - **First tranche: \u00a3350,000**, expected to be drawn shortly. - **Conversion price:** - 82% of the **lowest daily VWAP** over the **5 days** before conversion. - This is a *variable\u2011price convertible* \u2014 often called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d structure if mismanaged. - **Mandatory conversion at maturity** (12 months), unless redeemed earlier. - **Company buy\u2011back option:** - FCM can redeem notes at **125%** of nominal value before maturity. - **Commitment fee:** 2% per tranche. - **Warrants:** - 35% of each tranche value. - Up to **350,000 warrants** total. - Strike price = 120% of the closing price before each tranche. - 3\u2011year life. - **First tranche warrants:** - **4,803,922 warrants @ 2.55p**. 2. Use of Proceeds** - Fund **maiden drill programme** at the **Sunbeam Property** (Ontario). - Provide **general working capital**. - Pay the final **CAD$100,000** to secure **100% ownership** of the **Kerrs Gold Property** (386,000 oz historical resource). 3. Operational Update** - Winter conditions now allow access to drill targets at Sunbeam. - Drill programme design underway; mobilisation updates to follow. - Kerrs Gold final payment will complete full ownership. --- \ud83d\udcca **What This Means for Shareholders** *\u2714 Positive Aspects** - Funding secured without traditional interest costs. - Enables drilling at a strategically important time (high gold prices). - Full ownership of Kerrs Gold strengthens the asset base. - Warrants priced at a premium (120%) \u2014 better than discounted warrants. *\u26a0 Dilution & Risk Considerations** This CLN is **highly dilutive** if converted: - Conversion at **82% of the lowest VWAP** is a *discounted variable\u2011price mechanism*. - If the share price weakens, conversion creates more shares \u2192 more dilution \u2192 further price pressure. - The 4.8m warrants at 2.55p add additional potential dilution. This structure is common for small-cap explorers but requires careful management to avoid a downward spiral.",

New \u00a31,000,000 Convertible Loan Note (CLN) Facility** FCM has secured an interest\u2011free CLN agreement with an international investor, providing up to **\u00a31m** in staged tranches. **Key terms:** - **Interest\u2011free** (unusual and favourable on the surface). - **First tranche: \u00a3350,000**, expected to be drawn shortly. - **Conversion price:** - 82% of the **lowest daily VWAP** over the **5 days** before conversion. - This is a *variable\u2011price convertible* \u2014 often called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d structure if mismanaged. - **Mandatory conversion at maturity** (12 months), unless redeemed earlier. - **Company buy\u2011back option:** - FCM can redeem notes at **125%** of nominal value before maturity. - **Commitment fee:** 2% per tranche. - **Warrants:** - 35% of each tranche value. - Up to **350,000 warrants** total. - Strike price = 120% of the closing price before each tranche. - 3\u2011year life. - **First tranche warrants:** - **4,803,922 warrants @ 2.55p**. 2. Use of Proceeds** - Fund **maiden drill programme** at the **Sunbeam Property** (Ontario). - Provide **general working capital**. - Pay the final **CAD$100,000** to secure **100% ownership** of the **Kerrs Gold Property** (386,000 oz historical resource). 3. Operational Update** - Winter conditions now allow access to drill targets at Sunbeam. - Drill programme design underway; mobilisation updates to follow. - Kerrs Gold final payment will complete full ownership. --- \ud83d\udcca **What This Means for Shareholders** *\u2714 Positive Aspects** - Funding secured without traditional interest costs. - Enables drilling at a strategically important time (high gold prices). - Full ownership of Kerrs Gold strengthens the asset base. - Warrants priced at a premium (120%) \u2014 better than discounted warrants. *\u26a0 Dilution & Risk Considerations** This CLN is **highly dilutive** if converted: - Conversion at **82% of the lowest VWAP** is a *discounted variable\u2011price mechanism*. - If the share price weakens, conversion creates more shares \u2192 more dilution \u2192 further price pressure. - The 4.8m warrants at 2.55p add additional potential dilution. This structure is common for small-cap explorers but requires careful management to avoid a downward spiral.",

The E Zone is located near surface and is close to existing underground development. HMC drilled a total of  6 holes for 4,240 metres. This, they say, proves categorically that new mineralised zones remain to be discovered in the mine area. Decent intervals and grades of up to a magnificent 90.45 g/t which is the stuff dreams are made of. If assays from our maiden drill programme conducted just a handful of kilometres away, and due imminently, look anything like these, then First Class Metals are off to the races:- Hole 6702501 intersected 19.11 g/t Au over 5.0 m Hole 6702503 intersected 15.79 g/t Au over 5.0 m Hole 6702505 intersected 7.08 g/t Au over 12.1 m and 90.45 g/t Au over 2.6 m",

A 10 hole average at best therefore would give us around 75 to 80 metres actual length for each, with true depth obviously less with  how much so depending on angle of entry (variously -70 to -45 ). A 80m hole at -70 entry for example would give true depth of X = 80 x sine 70 which is 80 x 0.9397 for 75.18 m. The same meterage of 80 but at -45 would give a shallower 55.57m.

We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year\u201d. So, whilst no assays yet (200 samples have already gone to Actlabs), the team are clearly liking what they see in the core. The terminology used suggests a pretty high degree of confidence in what the lab analysis might show. In addition, although this is a pilot or \u2018first pass\u2019 drill programme, I am especially pleased to see that they have the confidence to exceed the meterage before any assays are received confirming that they are positive for au. Again, this tends to reaffirm that high degree of confidence, as dd drilling at even near surface is a costly exercise especially in the relatively high risk world of a first or maiden drill programme on a project area. Can\u2019t wait for first results.",

Of course FCM needs funds and time to donthe work required to prove them up. Asset sale would indeed be a huge catalyst and hopefully some promising results from drilling. I am convinced that the sum of the parts here is worth many many multiples of current mcap.",

That\u2019s a rise of over 100 per cent in the last few months. Li shortfall now predicted for 2026 rather than 2028. Second Li trend confirmed and third suspected. ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can! Excitement definitely returning here.",

Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

          "full_content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 2142S\nFirst Class Metals PLC\n09 February 2026\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as stipulated under the retained EU law version of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (the \"UK MAR\") which is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of the UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nFIRST CLASS METALS PLC\n09 February 2026\nZigzag Earn-In Acceleration and Issue of Equity\nFirst Class Metals PLC (LSE: FCM), the UK-listed metals exploration company focused on high-quality critical and precious metal assets in Ontario, Canada, is pleased to announce that it has elected to accelerate the final share-based option payment to Nuinsco Resources Limited\n(\"Nuinsco\")\nin respect of the Zigzag Lithium Property.\nUnder the terms of the existing option agreement, the Company is required to issue C$85,000 in ordinary shares to Nuinsco on or before 1 June 2026, representing the final share consideration payable as part of the earn-in to the Zigzag Lithium Property. The Company has now elected to satisfy this share-based obligation ahead of schedule.\nAccordingly, the Company will issue 2,277,816 (issue price 0.0198 GBP) new ordinary shares of 0.1p each in the capital of the Company (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") to Nuinsco in settlement of this obligation (the \"\nIssue\n\").\nThe Company confirms that, following completion of the Issue and the making of the remaining cash payment and satisfaction of the work commitments in accordance with the option agreement, First Class Metals will earn an 80% interest in the Zigzag Lithium Property, with Nuinsco retaining a 20% interest. Upon completion of the earn-in, the parties will be deemed to have entered into a joint venture for the development of the property on an 80:20 basis.\nThe Board believes that accelerating the share-based component of the earn-in is in the best interests of shareholders, as it materially advances the Company towards completion of the earn-in and strengthens its position within the joint venture structure.\nMarc J Sale, First Class Metals CEO, Commented:\n\"Zigzag is a key lithium and critical metals asset for the Company and has delivered encouraging exploration results to date. Accelerating the share-based element of the earn-in reflects our confidence in the rally of the lithium price and thus our intention to secure the management and ownership of the property.\"\nStrategic rationale\nThe Zigzag Lithium Property forms part of the Company's broader strategy of advancing prospective critical metal assets through early-stage consolidation and value creation. The Board notes the recent improvement in global lithium prices and renewed interest in the lithium sector, alongside increasing strategic and governmental focus on securing reliable supply of critical metals. In light of increased confidence in lithium pricing and the anticipated formation of the joint venture, the Company has revised quotations for a beneficiation study and intends to collect a representative 40 kilogramme sample when ground conditions permit.\nIn addition to its lithium potential, the Zigzag Property is considered prospective for a suite of critical metals including rubidium, gallium and tantalum, which are classified as critical minerals and increasingly recognised for their importance in advanced technologies, energy transition applications and defence-related supply chains. By accelerating the share-based consideration, the Company reduces future earn-in uncertainty, improves transactional certainty and enhances its strategic positioning ahead of completion of the 80% earn-in and formation of the joint venture.\nBackground-Zigzag Lithium Property\nThe Zigzag Lithium Property is one of First Class Metals PLC's most advanced exploration assets and represents a high-grade lithium and critical metals discovery located in Ontario's rapidly emerging battery minerals corridor.\nDrilling and surface sampling undertaken to date have confirmed the presence of at least one spodumene-rich pegmatite extending over approximately 800 metres of strike, with lithium grades of up to 5.19% Li\u2082O and associated enrichment in critical metals including tantalum, rubidium and gallium. The Project is strategically located less than 20 kilometres from Green Technology Metals' (ASX:GT1) Seymour Lake lithium project and lies within a proven Tier-1 lithium district that forms part of Canada's national critical minerals strategy.\nExploration activities completed during the 2023 drill programme comprised ten diamond drill holes for a total of approximately 450 metres, with nine of the ten holes intersecting pegmatite, (the tenth hole was a scissor hole), confirming strong geological continuity. Notable drill intersections include 4.3 metres at 1.65% L",

Such is its scale, that they have pushed on development and now have established a maiden mineral resource estimate for Rubidium at North Aubry: \u201cGT1 Managing Director Cameron Henry said the discovery adds an exciting new dimension to the project\u2019s strategic value. Seymour is well positioned to play a critical role in the global supply of this high-value specialty metal as one of the largest high-grade Rubidium resources on the ASX and the most substantial in Canada. The company plans to progress targeted test work to better understand Rubidium\u2019s recovery potential and integrate this opportunity within its broader strategy.\u201d Interestingly enough, First Class Metals confirmed Rubidium in every hole at Zig Zag. Just wondering if this might be a factor; complimenting the Lithium.",

New \u00a31,000,000 Convertible Loan Note (CLN) Facility** FCM has secured an interest\u2011free CLN agreement with an international investor, providing up to **\u00a31m** in staged tranches. **Key terms:** - **Interest\u2011free** (unusual and favourable on the surface). - **First tranche: \u00a3350,000**, expected to be drawn shortly. - **Conversion price:** - 82% of the **lowest daily VWAP** over the **5 days** before conversion. - This is a *variable\u2011price convertible* \u2014 often called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d structure if mismanaged. - **Mandatory conversion at maturity** (12 months), unless redeemed earlier. - **Company buy\u2011back option:** - FCM can redeem notes at **125%** of nominal value before maturity. - **Commitment fee:** 2% per tranche. - **Warrants:** - 35% of each tranche value. - Up to **350,000 warrants** total. - Strike price = 120% of the closing price before each tranche. - 3\u2011year life. - **First tranche warrants:** - **4,803,922 warrants @ 2.55p**. 2. Use of Proceeds** - Fund **maiden drill programme** at the **Sunbeam Property** (Ontario). - Provide **general working capital**. - Pay the final **CAD$100,000** to secure **100% ownership** of the **Kerrs Gold Property** (386,000 oz historical resource). 3. Operational Update** - Winter conditions now allow access to drill targets at Sunbeam. - Drill programme design underway; mobilisation updates to follow. - Kerrs Gold final payment will complete full ownership. --- \ud83d\udcca **What This Means for Shareholders** *\u2714 Positive Aspects** - Funding secured without traditional interest costs. - Enables drilling at a strategically important time (high gold prices). - Full ownership of Kerrs Gold strengthens the asset base. - Warrants priced at a premium (120%) \u2014 better than discounted warrants. *\u26a0 Dilution & Risk Considerations** This CLN is **highly dilutive** if converted: - Conversion at **82% of the lowest VWAP** is a *discounted variable\u2011price mechanism*. - If the share price weakens, conversion creates more shares \u2192 more dilution \u2192 further price pressure. - The 4.8m warrants at 2.55p add additional potential dilution. This structure is common for small-cap explorers but requires careful management to avoid a downward spiral.",

New \u00a31,000,000 Convertible Loan Note (CLN) Facility** FCM has secured an interest\u2011free CLN agreement with an international investor, providing up to **\u00a31m** in staged tranches. **Key terms:** - **Interest\u2011free** (unusual and favourable on the surface). - **First tranche: \u00a3350,000**, expected to be drawn shortly. - **Conversion price:** - 82% of the **lowest daily VWAP** over the **5 days** before conversion. - This is a *variable\u2011price convertible* \u2014 often called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d structure if mismanaged. - **Mandatory conversion at maturity** (12 months), unless redeemed earlier. - **Company buy\u2011back option:** - FCM can redeem notes at **125%** of nominal value before maturity. - **Commitment fee:** 2% per tranche. - **Warrants:** - 35% of each tranche value. - Up to **350,000 warrants** total. - Strike price = 120% of the closing price before each tranche. - 3\u2011year life. - **First tranche warrants:** - **4,803,922 warrants @ 2.55p**. 2. Use of Proceeds** - Fund **maiden drill programme** at the **Sunbeam Property** (Ontario). - Provide **general working capital**. - Pay the final **CAD$100,000** to secure **100% ownership** of the **Kerrs Gold Property** (386,000 oz historical resource). 3. Operational Update** - Winter conditions now allow access to drill targets at Sunbeam. - Drill programme design underway; mobilisation updates to follow. - Kerrs Gold final payment will complete full ownership. --- \ud83d\udcca **What This Means for Shareholders** *\u2714 Positive Aspects** - Funding secured without traditional interest costs. - Enables drilling at a strategically important time (high gold prices). - Full ownership of Kerrs Gold strengthens the asset base. - Warrants priced at a premium (120%) \u2014 better than discounted warrants. *\u26a0 Dilution & Risk Considerations** This CLN is **highly dilutive** if converted: - Conversion at **82% of the lowest VWAP** is a *discounted variable\u2011price mechanism*. - If the share price weakens, conversion creates more shares \u2192 more dilution \u2192 further price pressure. - The 4.8m warrants at 2.55p add additional potential dilution. This structure is common for small-cap explorers but requires careful management to avoid a downward spiral.",

As such, and as risk factors would come very much into play in a \u2018first pass\u2019, I would argue not more than between 50 to 100m. A 10 hole average at best therefore would give us around 75 to 80 metres actual length for each, with true depth obviously less with  how much so depending on angle of entry (variously -70 to -45 ). A 80m hole at -70 entry for example would give true depth of X = 80 x sine 70 which is 80 x 0.9397 for 75.18 m. The same meterage of 80 but at -45 would give a shallower 55.57m. Both are decent depths for a \u2018near surface\u2019 maiden drill programme.",

In the RNS (now 11 days ago) Fcm confirmed that the intention was to recommence drilling last week to complete the planned programme before Christmas. We know already that they were talking about \u2018surpassing\u2019 the planned meterage (700m). They should be pretty much finished in the next day or two if not already? Fcm confirmed that \u201c the geological features observed to date reinforce our confidence in the Dead Otter trend as a compelling gold target within the North Hemlo Project. We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year\u201d. So, whilst no assays yet (200 samples have already gone to Actlabs), the team are clearly liking what they see in the core. The terminology used suggests a pretty high degree of confidence in what the lab analysis might show. In addition, although this is a pilot or \u2018first pass\u2019 drill programme, I am especially pleased to see that they have the confidence to exceed the meterage before any assays are received confirming that they are positive for au. Again, this tends to reaffirm that high degree of confidence, as dd drilling at even near surface is a costly exercise especially in the relatively high risk world of a first or maiden drill programme on a project area. Can\u2019t wait for first results.",

That\u2019s a rise of over 100 per cent in the last few months. Li shortfall now predicted for 2026 rather than 2028. Second Li trend confirmed and third suspected. ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can!

Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",

It\u2019s amazing the lithium deficit was initially meant to be 2029 , then suddenly analysts change to 2026 . I watch the lithium aspects very closely and with BESS demand accelerating , I have no doubt lithium prices will rise further this year . The two years of low lithium has hampered lithium investment and now it\u2019s going to be caught with excess demand . I rember well with prem how companies chased them to have a piece of Zulu and same could happen here with spodumene set to rise this year and next . I recall the mine next to Zulu selling for $422 m and it was a plot of land only and zig zag could go the same",

Hope things continue to improve under Hill although he does (sorry \ud83d\ude01) have a hill to climb. He does have decent antecedents and doubt he will want to fail. Fcm brass are top communicators and have maintained this as best they can during the LOI months. We are all desperate for firm news on divestment and asset tokenisation front, but the vibe is that we are nearing a conclusion. Had you invested prior to the drill campaign on the DOT? Almost daily video updates as the programme developed which was great to see from two perspectives. Firstly was the technical side and speed at which they moved to complete pre Christmas even with a short forced break. The second was the barely constrained optimism from Marc Sale on visual inspection of the core from most, if not all, 10 holes. Obviously, things all went quiet once the samples were submitted for analysis but hoping that we start to see results imminently. Other things still bubbling quietly; news due on Sunbeam drill plans (suspect Roy trend) and commencement date, 79th shares situation, and now, as discussed yesterday, what firm news may appear about Zig Zag intent, following the decision announced yesterday to accelerate payment.",

Just checked out their latest company presentation and realised that they have uncovered significant Rubidium. Such is its scale, that they have pushed on development and now have established a maiden mineral resource estimate for Rubidium at North Aubry: \u201cGT1 Managing Director Cameron Henry said the discovery adds an exciting new dimension to the project\u2019s strategic value. Seymour is well positioned to play a critical role in the global supply of this high-value specialty metal as one of the largest high-grade Rubidium resources on the ASX and the most substantial in Canada. The company plans to progress targeted test work to better understand Rubidium\u2019s recovery potential and integrate this opportunity within its broader strategy.\u201d Interestingly enough, First Class Metals confirmed Rubidium in every hole at Zig Zag. Just wondering if this might be a factor; complimenting the Lithium.",

Just checked out their latest company presentation and realised that they have uncovered significant Rubidium. Such is its scale, that they have pushed on development and now have established a maiden mineral resource estimate for Rubidium at North Aubry: \u201cGT1 Managing Director Cameron Henry said the discovery adds an exciting new dimension to the project\u2019s strategic value. Seymour is well positioned to play a critical role in the global supply of this high-value specialty metal as one of the largest high-grade Rubidium resources on the ASX and the most substantial in Canada. The company plans to progress targeted test work to better understand Rubidium\u2019s recovery potential and integrate this opportunity within its broader strategy.\u201d Interestingly enough, First Class Metals confirmed Rubidium in every hole at Zig Zag. Just wondering if this might be a factor; complimenting the Lithium.",

New \u00a31,000,000 Convertible Loan Note (CLN) Facility** FCM has secured an interest\u2011free CLN agreement with an international investor, providing up to **\u00a31m** in staged tranches. **Key terms:** - **Interest\u2011free** (unusual and favourable on the surface). - **First tranche: \u00a3350,000**, expected to be drawn shortly. - **Conversion price:** - 82% of the **lowest daily VWAP** over the **5 days** before conversion. - This is a *variable\u2011price convertible* \u2014 often called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d structure if mismanaged. - **Mandatory conversion at maturity** (12 months), unless redeemed earlier. - **Company buy\u2011back option:** - FCM can redeem notes at **125%** of nominal value before maturity. - **Commitment fee:** 2% per tranche. - **Warrants:** - 35% of each tranche value. - Up to **350,000 warrants** total. - Strike price = 120% of the closing price before each tranche. - 3\u2011year life. - **First tranche warrants:** - **4,803,922 warrants @ 2.55p**. 2. Use of Proceeds** - Fund **maiden drill programme** at the **Sunbeam Property** (Ontario). - Provide **general working capital**. - Pay the final **CAD$100,000** to secure **100% ownership** of the **Kerrs Gold Property** (386,000 oz historical resource). 3. Operational Update** - Winter conditions now allow access to drill targets at Sunbeam. - Drill programme design underway; mobilisation updates to follow. - Kerrs Gold final payment will complete full ownership. --- \ud83d\udcca **What This Means for Shareholders** *\u2714 Positive Aspects** - Funding secured without traditional interest costs. - Enables drilling at a strategically important time (high gold prices). - Full ownership of Kerrs Gold strengthens the asset base. - Warrants priced at a premium (120%) \u2014 better than discounted warrants. *\u26a0 Dilution & Risk Considerations** This CLN is **highly dilutive** if converted: - Conversion at **82% of the lowest VWAP** is a *discounted variable\u2011price mechanism*. - If the share price weakens, conversion creates more shares \u2192 more dilution \u2192 further price pressure. - The 4.8m warrants at 2.55p add additional potential dilution. This structure is common for small-cap explorers but requires careful management to avoid a downward spiral.",

New \u00a31,000,000 Convertible Loan Note (CLN) Facility** FCM has secured an interest\u2011free CLN agreement with an international investor, providing up to **\u00a31m** in staged tranches. **Key terms:** - **Interest\u2011free** (unusual and favourable on the surface). - **First tranche: \u00a3350,000**, expected to be drawn shortly. - **Conversion price:** - 82% of the **lowest daily VWAP** over the **5 days** before conversion. - This is a *variable\u2011price convertible* \u2014 often called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d structure if mismanaged. - **Mandatory conversion at maturity** (12 months), unless redeemed earlier. - **Company buy\u2011back option:** - FCM can redeem notes at **125%** of nominal value before maturity. - **Commitment fee:** 2% per tranche. - **Warrants:** - 35% of each tranche value. - Up to **350,000 warrants** total. - Strike price = 120% of the closing price before each tranche. - 3\u2011year life. - **First tranche warrants:** - **4,803,922 warrants @ 2.55p**. 2. Use of Proceeds** - Fund **maiden drill programme** at the **Sunbeam Property** (Ontario). - Provide **general working capital**. - Pay the final **CAD$100,000** to secure **100% ownership** of the **Kerrs Gold Property** (386,000 oz historical resource). 3. Operational Update** - Winter conditions now allow access to drill targets at Sunbeam. - Drill programme design underway; mobilisation updates to follow. - Kerrs Gold final payment will complete full ownership. --- \ud83d\udcca **What This Means for Shareholders** *\u2714 Positive Aspects** - Funding secured without traditional interest costs. - Enables drilling at a strategically important time (high gold prices). - Full ownership of Kerrs Gold strengthens the asset base. - Warrants priced at a premium (120%) \u2014 better than discounted warrants. *\u26a0 Dilution & Risk Considerations** This CLN is **highly dilutive** if converted: - Conversion at **82% of the lowest VWAP** is a *discounted variable\u2011price mechanism*. - If the share price weakens, conversion creates more shares \u2192 more dilution \u2192 further price pressure. - The 4.8m warrants at 2.55p add additional potential dilution. This structure is common for small-cap explorers but requires careful management to avoid a downward spiral.",

The final #7 to #10 have been drilled around the Dead Otter Showing at 3.1 g/t to the south of the western side of DOL. This means that they have drilled a linear length of circa 3.5 km\u2019s on a sub 1000m pilot drill programme! That\u2019s a great result in itself! \u2026\u2026..and EVERY drill core shows potential mineralisation! The potential at North Hemlo could be very significant.

Near the mine and infrastructure, not to deep either, in fact only a fraction of the depth GGP had to drill to for theirs.

In the RNS (now 11 days ago) Fcm confirmed that the intention was to recommence drilling last week to complete the planned programme before Christmas. We know already that they were talking about \u2018surpassing\u2019 the planned meterage (700m). They should be pretty much finished in the next day or two if not already? Fcm confirmed that \u201c the geological features observed to date reinforce our confidence in the Dead Otter trend as a compelling gold target within the North Hemlo Project. We look forward to receiving the first assay results in the New Year\u201d. So, whilst no assays yet (200 samples have already gone to Actlabs), the team are clearly liking what they see in the core. The terminology used suggests a pretty high degree of confidence in what the lab analysis might show. In addition, although this is a pilot or \u2018first pass\u2019 drill programme, I am especially pleased to see that they have the confidence to exceed the meterage before any assays are received confirming that they are positive for au. Again, this tends to reaffirm that high degree of confidence, as dd drilling at even near surface is a costly exercise especially in the relatively high risk world of a first or maiden drill programme on a project area. Can\u2019t wait for first results.",

That\u2019s a rise of over 100 per cent in the last few months. Li shortfall now predicted for 2026 rather than 2028. Second Li trend confirmed and third suspected. ZZ could very well come back into play a lot sooner than expected. The asset sale and tokenisation LOI\u2019s were confirmed in i/v as still very much in play. A successful outcome for either of these would be superb; both would blow the doors off! North Hemlo drilling has restarted. From what we can see, most if not all, of the holes drilled so far appear very promising. A quick scan of the trend map shoes that there must be almost 3 and a half kilometres between NH-25-01 and 02 to the east, and NH-25-06 to the west. If both extremes shows gold in assay then there is the potential for a gold strike length of at least that length. This would be way bigger in linear distance than the Hemlo Gold mine now belonging to the newly created Hemlo Mining Corporation who will, I have no doubt, be all over our NH activities like a rash. This could be absolutely huge! And then Sunbeam. District scale potential and results due but not even scratched the surface. LOI success and you can bet MS will be hitting SB with everything he can! Excitement definitely returning here.",

Firstly, Garett Macdonald has been appointed Vice President Operations, and will also assume responsibilities of General Manager at the Hemlo Mine, supported by Deputy General Manager Dennis Bigras. In this role, Mr. Macdonald will report to Eric Tremblay, Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Macdonald is a professional mining engineer with over 30 years of industry experience in mine operations, project development and corporate leadership. In addition, Perry Blanchard has been appointed Vice President of Sustainability, bringing nearly 30 years of experience in environment, health and safety management in the mining industry. Most recently, Mr. Blanchard served as Vice President, Environment and Sustainability at Maritime Resources Corp., where he led the Hammerdown Project through environmental assessment, permitting, construction transition, and ultimately acquisition by New Found Gold Corp. in November 2025. It is clear that HMC mean business as it looks to establish itself as a leading Canadian mid-tier growth-focused gold producer, with an immediate focus on maximizing the value of the Hemlo Gold Mine's existing infrastructure through a fit-for-purpose operating approach, while unlocking new opportunities through \u201caggressive brownfields exploration.\u201d There is little doubt in my mind that HMC is a very ambitious new company who do not intend simply sitting back and draining the vestiges of gold from the old Hemlo pit. They are exploring neighbouring areas, and so will be watching the activities of First Class Metals like a hawk. The results of our maiden scout drill programme on the DOT will be very much on their radar. It would be good to know if MS or JK have touched base with them yet. A Zoom chat over a cuppa and a Custard Cream would do no harm. Good assays and our timing akin to this news, as well as continued pog increases, could be absolutely perfect.",
