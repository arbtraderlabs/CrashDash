Sale CEO First Class Metals commented:\n\"\nGold remains the cornerstone of FCM's exploration strategy and continues to underpin our approach to value accretion to FCM's Ontario properties. However, against a backdrop of accelerating global demand for Rare Earth Elements, and a clear strategic shift by allied governments towards securing critical minerals, the opportunity presented by these two properties is particularly compelling. Their geochemical and geographic location allows FCM to gain meaningful exposure to this evolving sector while maintaining our gold-focused exploration strategy and Ontario focus.\"\nOption Terms\nFirst Class Metals has entered into option agreements to acquire a\n100% interest\nin both Block F and Block H (each subject to a production royalty). The options are structured over a three-year period and provide the Company with the ability to evaluate the properties with limited upfront financial commitment.\nBlock F\nTo exercise the option over Block F, the Company must make\ntotal cash payments of CAD $73,500\nand issue\nCAD $60,000 in ordinary shares\nof the Company (\"Shares\") to the optionors over three years. Cash payments comprise CAD $9,500 payable within 30 working days of signing the agreement (the \"Effective Date\"), CAD $10,000 payable on the first anniversary of the Effective Date, CAD $16,000 on the second anniversary, and CAD $38,000 on the third anniversary.

Global demand for REE is forecast to grow materially.\nAs a result, REE continue to attract increasing attention from governments and industry seeking to secure long-term supply.\nCanada has formally identified REE as priority critical minerals and is positioning itself as a key allied jurisdiction capable of supporting secure, transparent and responsible supply chains. Federal and provincial initiatives are focused on encouraging domestic exploration and development, particularly in established mining regions with strong infrastructure and regulatory frameworks such as Ontario.\nThorium-associated REE systems, including those linked to batholithic and pegmatitic environments, are increasingly viewed as prospective exploration targets. FCM's entry into REE exploration in northwest Ontario aligns with this national strategic focus, while complementing the Company's core gold exploration activities within a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction.\nThe two claim blocks are located in the Atikokan area of northwest Ontario in relative proximity to the Sunbeam property, see Figure 1. Access to both blocks is excellent whilst forestry track on the properties all\nows internal access.\nFigure 1\nshowing the locations of Blocks F and H with relevant topographic information, note access as well as proximity to the Sunbeam property.\nThe decision to acquire the two blocks from a local prospector was based on the historic (Ontario Geological Survey) lake sediment programmes. To date no groundwork has been conducted by FCM. However, PowerMax Minerals (CSE:PMAX) who also acquired blocks in the area from the same vendor have conducted an initial prospecting programme.\nThe Company has initiated a detailed data review of all available material in advance of a prospecting orientated field programme.\nThe White Otter Batholith, north of Atikokan, Ontario represents one of the most anomalous REE areas in the province-wide 48,367 samples lake sediment database. There are 26 samples in the database with partial total REE>500ppm of which 9 (35%) are in the White Otter area, a number of which as covered by the newly optioned FCM claim blocks, see Figure 2.\nFigure 2\nlocation of blocks H & F relative to the assays from the province-wide lake sediments survey.\nThe White Otter batholith is a Thorium (Th) high. Anomalous REE's in lake sediments in the area are often associated with elevated Th.\nFigure 3\nBlock H, 81 cells, (4 multi cells) 1,712 Ha. Note the available access tracks\nREE anomalies occur within and around the eastern margin of the batholith within a 5km radius. It is possible that the White Otter batholith is a source for REE pegmatites or related mineralization in the area. Block H is in the core of the White Otter REE element anomaly, see Figures 2,3 and 4.\nFigure 4\nBlock H showing the anomalous Be and Th lake sediment samples\nBlock F\nsits astride what is interpreted as a major geological regional fault. This fault is emphasised by the topography and the anomalous lake sediment results further highlight this prospective feature. Satellite imagery of the area also shows possible pegmatite dykes. See Figures 3-5\nFigure 5\nBlock F, 7 multicell claims, 158 cells, area 3,332Ha, note the northeast orientation of anomalous assays, possibly related to a major regional fault within the White Otter Batholith\nFigure 6\nBlock F showing the anomalous Be and Th lake sediment samples\nFigure 7\nshowing Block F with possible pegmatites close to overlimit anomalies- examples arrowed\nFCM is now engaged in a interrogation of other historic data to compile a ground target list for the Spring exploration programme.\nENDS\nQualified Person\nThe technical disclosures contained in this announcement have been drafted in line with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum standards and guidelines and approved by Marc J.

In particular, the Hemlo 'camp' near Marathon, Ontario is a proven world class address for gold exploration, featuring the Hemlo gold deposit previously operated by Barrick Mining (>23M oz gold produced), with the past producing Geco and Winston Lake base metal deposits also situated in the region.\nFCM currently holds 100% ownership of seven claim blocks covering over 250km\u00b2 in northwest Ontario. A further three blocks are under option and cover an additional 30km2.FCM is focussed on exploring for gold but has base metals and critical metals mineralisation. FCM is maintaining a joint venture with GT Resources on the West Pickle Lake Property, a drill-proven ultra-high-grade Ni-Cu project.\nThe flagship properties, North Hemlo and Sunbeam, are gold focussed. North Hemlo has a significant discovery in the Dead Otter trend which is a discontinuous 3.5km gold anomalous trend with a 19.6g/t Au peak grab sample. This sampling being the highest known assay from a grab sample ever recorded on the North Limb of Hemlo.\nIn October 2022 FCM completed the option to purchase the historical high-grade past-producing Sunbeam gold mine near Atikokan, Ontario, ~15 km southeast of Agnico Eagle's Hammond Reef gold deposit (3.3 Moz of open pit probable gold reserves).\nFCM acquired the Zigzag Project near Armstrong, Ontario in March 2023. The property features Li-Ta-bearing pegmatites in the same belt as Green Technology Metals' Seymour Lake Project, which contains a Mineral Resource estimate of 9.9 Mt @ 1.04% Li2O. Zigzag was successfully drilled prior to Christmas 2023.\nThe Kerrs Gold property, acquired under option by First Class Metals in April 2024, is located in northeastern Ontario within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, one of the world's most prolific gold-producing regions. The project holds a historical inferred resource of approximately 386,000 ounces of gold, underscoring its potential as a meaningful addition to FCM's expanding gold portfolio. Kerrs Gold complements the Company's exploration strategy and provides exposure to a well-established mining district. FCM is currently reviewing plans to advance the project and further unlock its value.\nThe significant potential of the properties for precious, base and battery metals relates to 'nearology', since all properties lie in the same districts as known deposits (Hemlo, Hammond Reef, Seymour Lake), and either contain known showings, geochemical or geophysical anomalies, or favourable structures along strike from known showings (e.g. the Esa project, with an inferred Hemlo-style shear along strike from known gold occurrences).\nFor further information see the Company's presentation on the web site:\nwww.firstclassmetalsplc.com\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this announcement may contain forward-looking statements which are based on the Company's expectations, intentions and projections regarding its future performance, anticipated events or trends and other matters that are not historical facts.
