Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nANANDA DEVELOPMENTS PLC\n(\"Ananda\" or the \"Company\")\nPhase 1 Pharmacokinetics Study to be conducted on MRX1\nAnanda Developments plc (AQSE: ANA), a life sciences company focused on the research and clinical development of therapies for a range of complex inflammatory pain conditions, is pleased to announce that it has signed a contract with\nSouthern Star Research Pty Ltd\n('SSR'), a leading Australian Contract Research Organisation, to carry out a Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the pharmacokinetic (\"PK\") profile, tolerability and safety of the Company's lead investigative asset, MRX1.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nContract signed for Phase 1\nPK study\n\u00b7\nThe clinical trial will investigate the PK profile, tolerability and safety of MRX1 in healthy volunteers\n\u00b7\nThe data generated will inform future clinical trials in patients and form an integral part of any future regulatory applications, including with the MHRA in the United Kingdom or FDA in the United States\n\u00b7\nCollected data will form part of Ananda's MRX1 patent estate and wider intellectual property portfolio\n\u00b7\nSignificant financial advantages of running the study in Australia, including an R&D Tax Incentive of up to 43.5% of eligible research and development costs\nAnanda recently posted a blog about the reasons for running a PK study which is available to read\nhere\n,\nthe slides from a recent event regarding the reasons behind running a Phase 1 study in Australia are available\nhere\nand a summary video of this announcement is also available on the Hub alongside the RNS.\nAnanda has elected to conduct this Phase 1 study to provide in-human data on its MRX1 drug candidate, specifically related to\nPK, tolerability, and safety. This data will provide useful background information when discussing MRX1 and the wider Ananda drug development pipeline with potential investors, in partnering discussions with pharmaceutical companies, and with clinician investigators for clinical trials in other indications. Crucially, the study will form a foundational piece of the data package for regulatory filings.\nFurther to this, the findings from the PK study can be used as a key data source for submission of an Investigational New Drug ('IND') application to the Federal Drug Administration ('FDA') in the United States - a key first step to having a drug approved for use in the USA.\nThe next steps for the study are to complete the trial protocol and finalise agreements with a Phase\u00a01 unit that will run the trial site, before progressing to Human Research Ethics Committee (\"HREC\"), and a Clinical Trial Notification will be filed with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australian regulatory body) as well as securing a Good Manufacturing Practice certification of the MRX1 drug batch.\nAbout the MRX1 Phase 1 PK study\nThe study will dose 20 healthy volunteers with MRX1. It will measure PK levels following an acute (single) dose, as well as chronic dosing (where the PK levels will be measured over a period of six days) to investigate the accumulation of MRX1 in the body over the course of the study. The volunteers will be hospitalised for the duration of the study and include equal numbers of males and females.\nConducting the study in Australia\nThe study will be conducted in Australia because it has a vibrant Phase 1 offering and financial advantages. The Australia Tax Office offers a 43.5% cash rebate on all Research & Development work undertaken in Australia. The study will be conducted via Ananda's wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Tiamat Australia Pty Ltd.\nAbout MRX1\nMRX1 is an oil based, orally administered drug candidate which is to be used in two Phase 2 clinical trials, the first evaluating MRX1's efficacy in treating Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (\"CIPN\") and the second study is evaluating efficacy and retention in endometriosis patients. You can read more about the CIPN clinical trial\nhere\nand more about the endometriosis clinical trial\nhere\n.\nMelissa Sturgess, CEO of the Company, commented:\n\"\nThis study represents a significant milestone in MRX1's journey to market, providing us with key data for MRX1's licensed drug development. Working with an excellent company such as Southern Star Research is a reflection of the high quality of work produced by the Ananda team.\nSouthern Star Research's deep expertise in clinical research, particularly in the field of cannabinoids, will complement our own capabilities and accelerate the development of MRX1. We all look forward to updating shareholders as we progress through the deliverables on this project.\n\"\nDr. David Lloyd, Managing Director of Southern Star Research Pty Ltd, commented:\n\"We are t"

The trials will be run by investigators at University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nMRX formulations will be used as the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) in two NIHR/NHS funded Phase IIIa randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the treatment of complex epilepsies\n\u00b7\nTrial 1: MRX2 (CBD), MRX2T (CBD + THC) versus placebo in patients with refractory (drug-resistant) early onset epilepsies.\n\u00b7\nTrial 2: MRX2 (CBD), MRX2T (CBD + THC) versus placebo in patients of normal cognitive ability with refractory genetic generalised epilepsies.\n\u00b7\nThe study has been designed to support a marketing authorisation application for MRX2 & MRX2T and therefore, should the trials deliver successful results, MRX intends to progress further regulatory and commercial development activities of these medicines\n\u00b7\nExisting evidence suggests cannabis-based medicinal products are promising treatments for difficult to treat epilepsies, with one CBD-only medicine already licenced to treat three rare conditions associated with drug-resistant epilepsy\n\u00b7\nIn combination, the trials will involve up to 500 patients from across the UK and together, will be\nthe largest investigational trials conducted to date for cannabinoids as a treatment for refractory epilepsy\n\u00b7\nAnanda will be paid to supply MRX2, MRX2T and the matching placebo\n\u00b7\nA pre-recorded video relating to this news,\nis available for viewing via the Company's investor hub\nand Ananda's Finance Director Jeremy Sturgess-Smith will be recording a Q&A specific to these trials in a week. Investors are invited to submit questions in advance to be answered during the recording at:\nhttps://investors.anandadevelopments.com/link/lyaapy\n.\nThe objective of the trials test the safety and efficacy of Ananda's specific\ncannabidiol\n(CBD) and CBD plus\ntetrahydrocannabinol (\nTHC) formulations for two treatment-resistant epilepsy groups in children and adults. If the results are favourable, they will pave the way for a submission of these medicines to the MHRA and other regulatory bodies for regulatory approval.\nThe trials are being\nfunded by a partnership between NHS England and National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and will be co-led by Professor Finbar O'Callaghan and Professor Helen Cross of University College London (UCL) and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH).\nResearchers will study whether these medicines are safe and effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures experienced by individuals, as well as whether they affect learning, sleep, behaviour, quality of life, stress, and anxiety.\nThese will be the world's first double blind randomised controlled trials to investigate the use of CBD and THC together for epilepsy, and the first to evaluate the medicines in children and adults who have a broad range of difficult-to-treat epilepsies. Previously, double blind randomised controlled trials investigated the use of CBD-only in three rare conditions associated with drug-resistant epilepsy (Dravet Syndrome, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex).\n500 patients will be recruited across the UK at multiple NHS sites. The patients will be randomly assigned either CBD, a combination of CBD and THC, or a matched placebo manufactured to the specifications of\nAnanda Developments plc\n's\nformulations, which patients will take for 24 weeks\n. The formulations being used for the trials are Ananda's patent pending MRX2 (CBD) Oral Solution, MRX2T (CBD + THC) Oral Solution, and a matched placebo. The scale and design of the Phase IIIa trials will provide a greater understanding of both the benefits and potential risks of MRX2 and MRX2T as new treatments.\nNICE has estimated that the combined direct and indirect costs of epilepsy to the NHS are \u00a32 billion per annum and most of this is spent on patients with refractory epilepsy.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n: \"\nThe UK Government and the NHS have made it clear they need to see randomised controlled trials in a broad range of seizure types and\nepilepsies\nto enable wide prescribing of CBD- and THC-based medicines. We are proud that our\nMRX2\nand\nMRX2T products\nmeet the rigorous requirements for\nthese trials and have received the support of\ninternationally respected\nclinician investigators\nwith expertise i"

With 28 million people in the UK alone dealing with chronic pain and the NHS spending over \u00a35 billion annually on musculoskeletal pain, there is a pressing need for better, more effective treatments as in many of these conditions, which exhibit complex, chronic inflammation and pain, there is significant unmet medical need.\nWe believe in the transformative potential of cannabinoids, supported by a growing body of clinical and real-world evidence. Our commitment is to deliver:\n\u00b7\nRobust clinical trial evidence through partnerships with world-leading researchers and key opinion leaders\n\u00b7\nThe highest quality cannabinoid medicines, manufactured to the strictest pharmaceutical standards\n\u00b7\nLicensed cannabinoid medicines available initially on the NHS before looking to the global market\nOur patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation is being used in two fully funded Phase II randomised controlled trials into:\n\u00b7\nchemotherapy induced nerve pain; and\n\u00b7\nendometriosis\nAs announced earlier this month our\npatent-pending MRX2 and MRX2T CBD and CBD + tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) formulations have been selected as the active pharmaceutical ingredients in two funded Phase III randomised controlled trials\ninto:\n\u00b7\nrefractory (drug-resistant) early onset epilepsies; and\n\u00b7\nrefractory genetic generalised epilepsies\nIn these trials, which are funded by NIHR and NHS England, researchers will study whether MRX2 & MRX2T are safe and effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures experienced by people with epilepsy, as well as their effects on learning, sleep, behaviour, quality of life, stress, and anxiety.\nThe two studies will be the world's first double blind randomised controlled trials to investigate the use of CBD and THC together for epilepsy, and the first to evaluate the medicines in children and adults who have a broad range of difficult-to-treat epilepsies. Previously, double blind randomised controlled trials investigated the use of CBD-only in three rare conditions associated with drug-resistant epilepsy (Dravet Syndrome, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex).\nOver 18 months, 500 patients will be recruited across the UK at multiple NHS sites. The patients will be randomly assigned either CBD, a combination of CBD and THC, or a matched placebo supplied by\nAnanda Developments plc\n. The formulations being used for the trials are Ananda's patent pending MRX2 (CBD) Oral Solution, MRX2T (CBD + THC) Oral Solution, and a matched placebo. The scale and design of the Phase III trials will provide a greater understanding of both the benefits and potential risks of MRX2 and MRX2T as new treatments.\nAlso announced after the end of the period, our patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation is to undergo pharmacokinetic assessment in a Phase I study.\nAlso announced during the period, positive pre-clinical study results were received for our patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation in the potential treatment of\nHeart Fibrosis with Preserved Ejection Fraction\n.\nWe continue to investigate trials in other conditions including Heart Fibrosis with Preserved Ejection Fraction, as we aim to build a comprehensive pre-clinical pipeline.\nDuring the 6 months to 31 July 2024, the team focused on advancing the two Phase II clinical trials. This involved work to ensure a robust supply chain for the manufacture of the investigative medicines, writing the Investigator Brochure and Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier for the patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation, obtaining quotes for the pharmacokinetic study, liaising with the clinical trial teams at the University of Edinburgh and preparing submissions to the ethics committee in advance of dosing. Ethics approval is a key step towards dosing commencing in trial patients.\nWe have also been assessing regulatory, market access and pricing strategies with support of independent specialist advisors. We are working to ensure the clinical trials programme is designed in a way that is most likely to lead to marketing authorisations and healthcare provider uptake, principally via the NHS in the UK and in other countries.\nDuring the period we announced the formation of Ananda's Scientific Advisory Board. Chaired by Ananda's independent non-executive director Professor Clive Page, we are fortunate to have the added guidance of Professor Trevor Jones and Professor Cherry Wainright as we work towards our objective of delivering licenced CBD drugs to the NHS to treat complex chronic inflammatory pain c"

Ananda has a compliant, formulated and manufactured CBD formulation ready for delivery to its two Phase 2 clinical trials for endometriosis and chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN); both of which are chronic pain conditions with unmet medical needs.\nPresident Trump's Executive Order supports Ananda's commitment to deliver regulatory approved, safe and consistent products for areas of high unmet medical need. The Company's decision to work with a naturally derived CBD formulation bodes well for expedited, low-cost clinical trials and subsequent FDA authorisation and commercial rollout, benefiting patients and shareholders.\nAnanda is currently preparing for pre-IND meetings with the FDA to commence decentralised Phase 2 trials in the USA. The trials will include the longer-term collection of real-world evidence for the ongoing use of MRX1.\nMoving cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 under the Controlled Substances Act is a US Federal acknowledgement it has accepted medical use and lower abuse potential than previously classified. Schedule 1 substances are considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to have no currently accepted medical use and high abuse potential, making them illegal to prescribe and extremely difficult to research, while Schedule 3 substances can be legally prescribed by healthcare providers, investigated in clinical research and manufactured commercially.\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabidiol medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland) and chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR).

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n03 December 202\n5\nANANDA PHARMA PLC\n(\"Ananda\" or the \"Company\")\nEthics Approval for Phase 2 Clinical Trial for\nChemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy\nAnanda Pharma plc (AQSE: ANA, OTCQB: ANANF), a\nUK-based biopharmaceutical company developing regulatory approved, cannabidiol medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions\n, is pleased to announce that combined ethics and MHRA approval has been received for the Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of its investigational medicinal product, MRX1, for the treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN).\nTo view the supporting video and ask questions please go to our Hub:\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/link/peg30e\nThe Phase 2 trial, led by Professor Marie Fallon of The University of Edinburgh and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) as an Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) grant, is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of MRX1 in the treatment of CIPN. It will also assess the impact of MRX1 on quality of life and health care utilisation. The trial is a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study with a target enrolment of 92 participants.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n:\n\"Regulatory and ethical approval for our CIPN trial marks an important milestone in our commitment to advancing evidence-based treatments for chronic and inflammatory illnesses. CIPN affects hundreds of thousands of patients every year, yet there are no approved treatments. We are proud to be working with Professor Fallon and the NIHR to evaluate MRX1 in this area of urgent clinical need. Our goal is to bring real relief to patients facing the double burden of cancer and its long-term complications.\"\nCIPN is one of the most frequent chemotherapy side-effects, particularly of lung, breast, prostate, gastrointestinal, and germinal cancers, as well as different forms of leukaemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In the UK alone there are more than 140,000 new cases of CIPN each year and total prevalence of almost one million. In the US there are approximately 400,000 new patients each year at an annual healthcare cost of $2.5bn.\nThere are no effective therapies available for CIPN prevention, and symptomatic treatment is frequently ineffective. CIPN can continue to affect patients long after chemotherapy treatment has finished, and in some cases can force a reduction or cessation of chemotherapy dosing, increasing risk of death or prolonging treatment.\nThis regulatory and ethical approval allows the trial to now proceed toward patient recruitment and site initiation activities. Further updates will be provided as the study progresses with recruitment expected to begin in Q1 2026.\nThe Company announced on 24 November 2025 that it would be seeking approval from its shareholders to delist from the Aquis exchange. If shareholders approve the delisting at the general meeting to be held on 12 December 2025, then the delisting will be effective at 8.00 a.m. on 22 December 2025.\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma (AQSE: ANA OTC: ANANF) is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabinoid medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland) and chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR).

All reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild in severity (Grade 1), with no moderate or severe TEAEs reported. No serious adverse events were reported, and there were no further adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment or the study.\nAnanda expects to receive the\nfull final clinical study report in Q2 2026\n, which will contain the final reporting of adverse events as well as pharmacokinetic results. The Company does not expect any major changes from these preliminary safety results.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n: \"\nAnanda is now a clinical stage biotech with its lead drug candidate MRX1 demonstrating a favourable safety profile. The team is delighted with this result and looks forward to keeping shareholders updated with the full Phase 1 study readout which remains on track for delivery in Quarter 2, 2026\n.\"\nThe Phase 1 study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MRX1 in healthy adult volunteers. Two dose levels were tested, 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg of body weight. The effect of food was also assessed for lower dose level (2.5 mg/kg). A total of 20 participants received at least one dose of MRX1, with 10 participants receiving 2.5 mg/kg twice daily and 10 participants receiving 7.5 mg/kg twice daily. After a 14-day wash-out period, 9 of the 10 participants who had previously been dosed with MRX1 2.5 mg/kg in Period 1 received a single dose of MRX1 2.5 mg/kg under fed conditions in Period 2 (i.e., consumed a standardised high-fat, high-calorie meal within 30 minutes before dosing).\nThe Company announced on 24 November 2025 that it would be seeking approval from its shareholders to delist from the Aquis exchange.

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n24\nNovember 2025\nANANDA PHARMA PLC\n(\"\nAnanda\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\")\nNotice of General Meeting and proposed withdrawal from the AQSE Growth Market\nAnanda Pharma plc (AQSE: ANA, OTCQB: ANANF),\na\u00a0UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing regulatory approved, cannabidiol medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions,\u00a0announces that it has that it has today published a circular to shareholders (the \"\nCircular\n\") including a notice of general meeting (the \"\nGeneral Meeting\n\") in connection with the proposed withdrawal of admission of the Company's ordinary shares of \u00a30.002 each (\"\nOrdinary Shares\n\") to trading on the AQSE Growth Market pursuant to Rule 5.3 of the AQSE Growth Market Rulebook, together with proposals to re-register the Company as a private limited company, adopt new articles of association and change its name to Ananda Pharma Limited (together, the \"\nProposals\n\").\nSubject to shareholder approval of the relevant resolutions set out in the Circular (the \"\nResolutions\n\"), the General Meeting will be held at 11.00 a.m. on 12 December 2025 at the offices of Arch Law, Bishopsgate, 8 Bishopsgate, London, EC2N 4BQ.\nA copy of the Circular, which contains full details of the background, reasons and effects of the Proposals, and the accompanying form of proxy, has been posted to shareholders and is available on the Company's investor website\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/publications\n.\nAny capitalised terms not defined in this announcement shall have the same meaning as those defined in the Circular.\nRationale for the Proposals\nFollowing an extensive review, the Board has concluded that maintaining the Company's admission to trading on the AQSE Growth Market is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders at this time. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered, among other matters, the ongoing costs and regulatory burden of remaining admitted to trading, the limited liquidity in the Company's Ordinary Shares and associated share price volatility, and the Board's view that as a private company the Company will be better placed to access appropriately structured, specialist life sciences capital to support its clinical development programmes. The Board believes that the time and cost savings arising from the Proposals can be redeployed to core research and development activities, thereby better supporting the Company's strategy.\nExecutive Chairman's statement:\n\"\nAs you know I have funded Ananda with more than \u00a310m over the past 8 years. Despite our best efforts we have not managed to gain the funding support of the public markets, so we intend to delist the Company while we progress MRX1 development and our clinical trials. This move will save Ananda around \u00a3500,000 per annum. We will maintain quarterly communications with shareholders and offer, wherever possible, the opportunity to current shareholders to fund the business on the same terms as I will fund the company in the future.\nOur next milestones are receipt of the full readout from the Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study and commencement of the two Phase 2 placebo controlled clinical trials in endometriosis and Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN). These are expected to commence in Quarter 1 2026 and we look forward to keeping shareholders updated as we progress.\nTo be clear, we will continue to operate on the current strategy. The Company is changing its listing status and being re-registered as a private limited company. Further information regarding the delisting is set out in the letter from the Board.\nI would like to thank those of you who have invested in Ananda to date. We will be doing our utmost to get you a return.\nIf any shareholder has a question about this meeting and decision, please ask it here (\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/link/ejYBmy\n) and we will respond as soon as possible.\n\"\nExpected timetable of principal events\nPublication\nand posting\nof this\nCircular\n24 November\n2025\nLatest time and date for receipt of proxy appointments in respect of the General Meeting\n10\nDecember\n2025\nGeneral\nMeeting\n12 December\n2025\nLast day of dealings in Ordinary Shares on the\nAQSE Growth Market should the Resolutions be approved\n21 December\n2025\nCancellation of admission of the Ordinary Shares\nto trading on the AQSE Growth Market should\nthe Resolutions be approved\n8.00 a.m. on 22 December\n2025\nExpected re-registration as a private company effective should the Resolutions be approved\nbefore the end of January 2026\nFor the purposes of UK MAR, the person responsible for ar",

The refund is in relation to the Phase 1 study completed in Australia between July 2024 and June 2025.\nThe Company expects to receive a further refund in Q3 2026, in relation to expenditure on the Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study completed in Australia between July 2025 and June 2026. This refund is expected to be approximately AUD500,000 based on current forecasts.\nAnanda's Chief Executive Officer, Melissa Sturgess, commented\n: \"Australia's strong regulatory environment as well as advantageous tax arrangements, where a 43.5% refundable tax rebate is available for eligible R&D expenditure, have served us well. We can now deploy this refund into other clinical trial workstreams and look forward to continuing apace and updating shareholders as we progress.\"\nThe\nPhase I, Open-Label, Multiple Dose Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, Tolerability and Food Effect of MRX1 in Healthy Adults\nis sponsored by the Company's wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Tiamat Australia Pty Ltd, and run in partnership with Australian CRO Southern Star Research. The objectives of the study have been to assess the safety and tolerability of MRX1 and to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of MRX1 in both men and women.\nThe study commenced dosing on 15 July 2025 and last participant last visit was completed on 1 October 2025. A total of 19 participants were dosed (9 male and 10 female) across two dosing cohorts.\nAnanda expects to receive final safety and tolerability data from the trial in Q4 2025, with the final study report including pharmacokinetic results to be finalised in Q1 2026. The data generated from this study will become part of the clinical data package supporting MRX1 in future regulatory filings with regulators such as the FDA, EMA and MHRA. It will also help to inform future clinical trial protocols and the development of suitable dosing regimens.\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma (AQSE: ANA) is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabidiol medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland) and chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR).

Viridian is a US based investment bank with a long and successful history of mergers, acquisitions and capital raising in the North American cannabis sector. We have identified the US as the main target market both from a funding and a commercial perspective, given its depth in pharmaceuticals and cannabis businesses. Since appointing Viridian we have been working with their president and founder, Scott Greiper, on refining the Ananda story and how we communicate that story to make sure we are properly prepared for the US market activities. To support this US focus and increase corporate visibility, we have had Ananda's shares admitted to trading on the OTC exchange in New York under ticker ANANF.\nDuring the period Chris Tovey, Giles Moss and Andy Rust were also appointed as Advisors. Chris and Giles are both ex-GW Pharma senior executives. Chris, in particular, was part of the GW team which took Epidiolex through Federal Drug Administration ('FDA') and EMA regulatory approvals, was a key driver of GW Pharma's ('GW') IPO onto NASDAQ and its sale to Jazz Pharmaceuticals for USD7.2bn in 2021. Giles was a senior European executive with the group. Together they bring significant expertise in CBD drug development and regulatory approvals as well as experience working for a quoted pharmaceutical company and managing very large and complex transactions. We see them as key resources as MRX1 moves through its clinical development and also as we grow Ananda corporately.\nAndy is a veteran of pharmaceutical sales, with specific experience in pain medication sales in the US. His most recent role was as Head of Respiratory at Chiesi Group, where he led the strategic direction of the group's portfolio, helping grow revenues of the respiratory range to over \u20ac1.5 billion. Andy is on board to provide long-range strategic thinking for Ananda as we begin to plan in detail our go to market strategy.\nMRX1 (Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic study ('PK'), Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy ('CIPN') & Endometriosis)\nWe have now completed the development work for MRX1. We have gathered the required stability data (2 years), produced the required number of consistent 'trial' manufacturing batches (3) and completed the Dossier that sits alongside MRX1 as an 'Investigational Medicine' ('IM'). This work is required for all IMs ahead of use in a clinical trial/setting. Following completion of this work, we completed the manufacturing of a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) batch of MRX1 for use in all three of our MRX1 clinical trials. 40 litres were formulated, representing the first half of the required volume for the CIPN and endometriosis trials and all of the required volume of MRX1 for our Phase 1 study in Australia.\nRegarding the Phase 1 study, we delivered the required volume of MRX1 CBD formulation to the trial site in Melbourne, Australia. The Phase 1 trial is designed to give us detailed data on the pharmacokinetic profile of MRX1including safety, tolerability, food effect and PK of MRX1. PK is the way the body absorbs a drug, how it stays in the body and the rate of excretion. Following the end of the period, we announced that the last participant had completed dosing and that next milestones on this study are 1) confirmation of no adverse events, expected before the end of the year, and 2) the final study report, due in Q1 2026.\nAs the Phase 1 study ran in Australia, we will be due an R&D tax rebate of up to 43.5% of qualifying expenditure, making it the most cost-effective location to run the trial without sacrificing regulatory robustness - Australian trial data is readily accepted by the FDA and MHRA. The first year's R&D tax return was recently submitted and the cash rebate will be disclosed as part of the next set of Group accounts.\nOn CIPN and endometriosis, we have been working with the clinical trial teams to prepare the protocols and supporting documents for trial commencement. We expect to receive ethics approvals for both trials before the end of the year and for recruitment to start shortly thereafter. The timeline of the endometriosis and CIPN trials is independent of the Phase 1 PK study read out and will run concurrently.\nTo conclude, I have to say that th",

I am particularly pleased that half the participants in the study were female. It is crucial for our strategy to advance MRX1 CBD through the regulatory pathway for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis that we understand how MRX1 CBD acts in the female body.\n\"With increasing attention on the role of CBD in elder care and chronic pain, highlighted most recently by President Trump's video post on Truth Social (\nhttps://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115283887618990920\n), we are encouraged that the dialogue around FDA approved pharmaceutical CBD is gaining prominence.

Ananda also understands that the contractor has been unable to fulfil its obligations under its agreement with UCL/GOSH and that UCL/GOSH is seeking an alternative supplier.\nGiven the ongoing delays to the epilepsy programme - with first patient dosing now not expected before 2027 and readouts unlikely until 2029 - and the intellectual property constraints in this indication,\nAnanda will now concentrate its resources on its lead programme: the patent-pending MRX1 formulation for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).\nMelissa Sturgess, CEO of Ananda, commented:\n\"While it is disappointing that the epilepsy programme has stalled, this outcome allows us to focus our resources where the opportunity is strongest and the path to market is clearer. Ananda is determined to bring MRX1 CBD forward for the treatment of pain in endometriosis - a condition affecting 190 million women worldwide with few effective options - and in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. These are areas of great unmet need where we believe MRX1 can make a real difference for patients.

At the time of writing Ananda has progressed the manufacturing of its proprietary MRX1 CBD formulation through stability and its contract manufacturer, has made one batch of MRX1 as an Investigational Medicinal Product for use in our sponsored Phase 1 and our partner sponsored Phase 2 Clinical Trials. This is a big step in Ananda's goal to achieve regulatory approval for MRX1 in one of its targeted conditions.\nOur aim is to develop the next CBD regulatory approved medicine - Epidiolex was the first CBD based product to be approved in 2018, it sold $972.4 million in 2024. We also know that in 2022 some 40% of the use of Epidiolex in the USA was off label - that is for uses other than the three epileptic conditions that it was licenced for. GW Pharmaceuticals (\"GW\") was the company that got Epidiolex licenced and since the end of the year Ananda has announced that it has recruited Chris Tovey, the ex-COO of GW, and Giles Moss, who was GM for Europe for GW as advisers. We believe that the addition of these two ex-GW executives provides significant strength to Ananda. Together, they will help guide the Ananda team with advice on the technical and regulatory aspects of drug licencing and strategy, as well as in financing and capital markets.\nDuring the year Ananda has continued to progress the previously announced clinical trial with the University of Edinburgh and announced that it would carry out a Phase 1 trial in Australia to investigate the pharmacokinetics of MRX1 the latter we are delighted to announce commenced in July 2025. In addition Ananda was successful in being part of tender to provide its formulations to University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital for two broad epilepsy trials, given our success in developing and supplying MRX1 to the standards required, we are confident that we can deliver these drugs too. Ananda is providing its formulations for the following clinical\nstudies:\n1.\nThe supply of MRX1, the Company's lead product, to a Phase 2a feasibility trial for endometriosis related pain. This study is being run by leading experts in endometriosis, Professor Andrew Home and Dr Lucy Whittaker, and is run through the University of Edinburgh (UofE) and is funded by NHS Scotland. The researchers on this trial sit within the Medical Research Council, one of the UK's foremost research bodies.\n2.\nThe supply of MRX1, to a Phase 2 efficacy study, led by Professional Marie Fallon to investigate chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) also out of UofE and funded by National Institute for Health and Care Research NIHR.\n3.\nThe supply of two cannabinoid-based medicines, MRX2 and MRX2T, to parallel Phase 3 clinical trials for refractory (drug-resistant) epilepsies. These trials are being run in a partnership between the Group, University College London (UCL), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH), the NHS and the NIHR. The lead investigators for these trials are two world leading experts in the field of neurology, Professors Finbar O'Callaghan and Helen Cross.\nI would like to thank the team at Ananda for the extraordinary progress the Company has made in the last year, in part",

The new PK study is designed to characterise systemic exposure and support future dose optimisation across indications. Importantly, the PK study will run independently of the ongoing Phase 2 trials and will not affect their timelines or execution.\nTo view the supporting video and ask questions please go to our Hub:\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/link/WrAj7P\nThe start of the Phase 1 study marks a major milestone in the clinical development of MRX1. While there is a large amount of data available to support the safety and tolerability of CBD in humans, this first-in-human study will deliver critical data for future clinical development and regulatory submissions to the FDA, EMA and MHRA.\nThe Phase 1 study is an open-label, multiple dose study designed to assess the PK, safety, tolerability and food effect of MRX1 in healthy adult volunteers. Initial results are anticipated in Q1 2026.\nThe dosing of the first participant follows the recent delivery of\nGMP-manufactured MRX1 to the Australian trial site\n. The study is now continuing in accordance with the study protocol and site schedule.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n: \"\nWe are delighted to have dosed the first participant in our Phase 1 trial using MRX1. This study is a strategic addition to the MRX1 program and sees us move from formulation development into full clinical execution.\nImportantly, it brings us one step closer to delivering a placebo controlled clinical trial tested, regulatory approved CBD medicine for women suffering from endometriosis and people struggling with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy to market.\n\"\nStudy Design and Methodology\nThe primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of MRX1 at two doses when administered twice daily in healthy adults. The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of MRX1 and to characterise the effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of MRX1 when taken with food vs without.\nA total of 20 healthy volunteers (10 male and 10 female) have been sequentially enrolled into 2 treatment groups, with 5 males and 5 females in each group.\nThe duration of the study is up to 52 days per participant for Group A and 37 days per participant for Group B, including screening and follow up. Last participant last dose is expected to be completed within three months.\nThe Phase 1 study is being sponsored by the Company's wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Tiamat Australia Pty Ltd.\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma (AQSE: ANA) is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabinoid medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland), chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR) and epilepsy (trials funded by NHS England and NIHR).

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n23 June 202\n5\nANANDA PHARMA PLC\n(\"Ananda\" or the \"Company\")\nKey Milestone on Path to Delivery of MRX1 to Clinical Trials\nAnanda Pharma plc (AQSE: ANA, OTCQB: ANANF), a\nUK-based biopharmaceutical company developing regulatory approved cannabinoid medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions\n, is pleased to announce that forty litres of its lead investigational product, MRX1, and forty litres of a matched placebo have been manufactured in compliance with pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practices ('GMP').\nTo view the supporting video and ask questions please go to our Hub:\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/link/qy1RDe\nThe manufacture of these clinical-grade batches marks a significant milestone in Ananda's pharmaceutical development programme. The 40-litre scale represents the largest volume of MRX1 and placebo produced by Ananda to date and is the first to receive GMP validation, a requirement for use in human clinical trials.\nThe MRX1 formulation is Ananda's lead investigational medicinal product ('IMP') and will be used in the Company's planned Phase 2 randomised controlled trials for chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and endometriosis-associated pain. The matched placebo is a critical component of the double-blind design of both the Phase 2 trials. A portion of the MRX1 batch will also be used in the Phase 1 trial the Company is running in Australia.\nThe manufacture was conducted at the certified GMP facility of Ananda's Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation, and the bottling process has been completed in full compliance with the required regulatory standards. The material will now be held under controlled storage conditions until release to the clinical trial sites. The Company will keep shareholders informed on the progress of IMP logistics and delivery, and will notify the market via RNS when IMP is received at a clinical trial site - whether in Scotland or Australia.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n: \"\nThe regulatory pathway is central to our strategy. Our goal is to secure approval for MRX1 as a CBD formulation from the FDA, EMA, and MHRA. Achieving this requires meticulous and high-precision work to ensure that we develop a CBD-based medicine accessible to all who need it, not just those who can afford it. Every regulatory milestone we meet enhances the product's value - and this represents a particularly significant milestone.\n\".\nMRX1 IMP versus 'medical cannabis oil'\nManufacturing MRX1 as an IMP requires a far stricter regulatory oversight than manufacturing unlicenced specials (the category under which most cannabis-based medicines are prescribed). In the UK, IMPs require release by a Qualified Person (QP) which is a legal role ensuring each batch meets GMP and clinical trial standards under Annex 13 of the EU Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice and Regulation (EU) 536/2014. Specials, by contrast, do not require QP sign-off and follow lighter, less resource-intensive GMP suited to one-off or patient-specific manufacture.\nSpecials are intended solely for clinical use in individual patients where no licensed alternative exists, not for research purposes and cannot be used in a clinical trial to assess efficacy as part of a regulatory approved drug development programme.\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma (AQSE: ANA, OTCQB: ANANF) is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabinoid medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including epilepsy (trials funded by NHS England and NIHR), endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland) and chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR).

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n2 June 202\n5\nANANDA PHARMA PLC\n(\"Ananda\" or the \"Company\")\nMRX1 Achieves 2 Years of Stability Data\nAnanda Pharma plc (AQSE: ANA, OTCQB: ANANF), a\nUK-based biopharmaceutical company developing regulatory approved cannabidiol (CBD) medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions\n, is pleased to announce that its lead investigational product, MRX1, has now successfully achieved twenty four months of stability data in accordance with ICH (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) guidelines.\nTo view the supporting video and ask questions please go to our Hub:\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/link/4PKL9y\nWhy Stability Data is Critical\n\u00b7\nDemonstrates the reliability, reproducibility, and robustness of the MRX1 formulation\n\u00b7\nAlong with the complete absence of intoxicating THC establishes the formulation as a well characterised CBD biopharmaceutical product\n\u00b7\nThis stability data is a key differentiator between MRX1 and any unlicenced product (including a cannabis-based medicine prescribed via a cannabis clinic or available via a dispensary), any UK Food Standards Agency approved CBD product, and any CBD product produced in accordance with the Farm Bill in the USA where the reliability of product is not verified\nStability testing is part of pharmaceutical development and assesses how a drug product maintains its quality over time when exposed to various environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and light. Specifically, MRX1 now has 24 months of standard and accelerated stability data. Accelerated data is where MRX1 was stored under higher temperatures, normally >30\u2070C, something that is particularly critical for MRX1 given its planned us in a Phase 1 trial taking place in Australia.\nRegulatory authorities such as the MHRA, FDA and EMA require stability data from multiple production batches to confirm that a drug product can be manufactured consistently to the same quality standards. The company continues to add supporting data to its regulatory package, providing assurance that the manufacturing process is well-controlled and reproducible.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n:\n\"This achievement shows the level of detail required to ensure we have a formulation that can ultimately become a regulatory approved medicine. There are no shortcuts.\"\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma (AQSE: ANA) is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabidiol medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including epilepsy (trials funded by NHS England and NIHR), endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland) and chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR).

He remained at GW until it was acquired by\nJazz Pharmaceuticals for $7.2 billion in 2021\n, the largest strategic exit transaction in the cannabinoid industry to date.\nMr. Moss will help guide the Ananda team with advice on the technical and regulatory aspects of drug licencing and strategy, and in financing and capital markets. Additionally, he will work closely with the Ananda Board to build out its best-in-class team to deliver its own regulatory approved CBD drug to market. Securing Mr. Moss' services allows Ananda to benefit from his unique experience in building a business around a a regulatory approved CBD drug and as with Chris Tovey,\nwhose appointment as Advisor\nwas announced on 8 April\n, it is intended that Mr Moss will join the Board in due course.\nTo align his interests with shareholders, a total of 30,000,000 options have been granted for ordinary shares of \u00a30.002 each in the capital of the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") to Mr Moss, subject to certain vesting and performance conditions, all with a 10-year life. The options have an exercise price of 0.41 pence, being the 7-day VWAP preceeding his appointment as a consultant. Conditional upon being appointed a director of the Company, Mr. Moss would be granted options over up to a further 45,000,000 Ordinary Shares with an exercise price of the 7-day VWAP preceeding his appointment to the Board of Ananda.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n: \"\nWe are honoured to have Giles join us. His input will help us achieve our ambition of getting a regulatory approved CBD drug to market faster and at a lower cost than would otherwise be the case. His senior level experience at GW will be invaluable and his commitment to Ananda is a vote of confidence in our approach and our team. We have now recruited two ex-GW leaders to our team, both are on track to increasing their roles and their remuneration is aligned with shareholders' interests - we take all three points as significant endorsements of Ananda's strategy and outlook.\"\nGiles Moss added\n: \"\nThere remains genuine unfinished business in the cannabinoid space due to the very limited therapeutic access to potentially life changing medicines. Demand from both physicians and patients for regulatory approved CBD therapeutics continues. The time is ripe to lead the way in developing the next generation of cannabis derived, regulatory approved medicines and I am very much looking forward to supporting Ananda on the journey\n.\"\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma (AQSE: ANA) is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabinoid medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including epilepsy (trials funded by NHS England and NIHR), endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland) and chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR).

UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN UK MAR) IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.\n8 April 202\n5\nANANDA PHARMA PLC\n(\"Ananda\" or the \"Company\")\nAppointment of Chris Tovey, GW Pharmaceuticals' Former COO\nAnanda Pharma plc (AQSE: ANA), a\nUK-based biopharmaceutical company developing regulatory approved cannabinoid medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions\n, is very pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Chris Tovey, ex-COO of GW Pharmaceuticals plc (\"GW\") and Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (\"Jazz\"), as an advisor to the Company.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nGW achieved the first ever regulatory approval for a naturally derived cannabidiol medicine in the US, UK and Europe.\n\u00b7\nChris was COO of GW Pharma when it was acquired by Jazz Pharmaceuticals for $7.2bn, globally the largest strategic cannabis exit to date\n\u00b7\nPost GW's acquisiton by Jazz, Chris was appointed COO of Jazz\n\u00b7\nExecutive leader at GW through its NASDAQ IPO and subsequent significant capital raisings (>$1bn over 8 years)\n\u00b7\nKey executive who led the operational growth of GW, including commercial expansion, manufacturing, technology and staffing\n\u00b7\nTo view the supporting video by Charles Morgan, Chairman of Ananda and to ask questions please go to our Hub:\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/link/NPwkAP\n\u00b7\nQ&A webinar by CEO Melissa Sturgess to be held on Friday 11th April at 12.30p.m. BST:\nhttps://investors.anandapharma.co.uk/webinars/0y5Rxe-chris-tovey-appointment-q-a\nChris Tovey was a key member of the leadership team at GW Pharmaceuticals plc (\"GW\"), the world's first pharmaceutical company to pursue and successfully secure FDA, EMA and MHRA approval for a CBD medicine that is now approaching Blockbuster (more than $1bn of annual revenues) status. He joined GW as an Executive Board Director and COO in 2012, and played a critical role taking GW from its IPO on NASDAQ in 2013 through to its acquisition by Jazz Pharmaceuticals for $7.2 billion in 2021: the largest strategic exit transaction in the cannabinoid industry to date.\nGiven Mr. Tovey's prior experience he will help guide Ananda's corporate, operational, commercial and drug development programmes. Working closely with the Ananda Board and Senior Management, he will support the build-out of its best-in-class team to deliver a regulatory approved CBD based medicine to patients and the market. It is expected that Mr. Tovey will join Ananda's Board in due course. To align his interests with shareholders, a total of 50,000,000 options have been granted for ordinary shares of \u00a30.002 each in the capital of the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") to Mr Tovey, subject to certain vesting and performance conditions, all with a 10-year life. The options have an exercise price of 0.44 pence, being the 7 day VWAP preceeding his appointment as a consultant. Conditional upon being appointed a director of the Company, Mr. Tovey would be granted options over up to a further 75,000,000 Ordinary Shares.\nAnanda's Chairman and largest shareholder, Charles Morgan commented\n: \"\nWe are honoured to have Chris join Ananda.\u00a0Securing his services allows us to benefit from his unique experience gaining the first-ever FDA and EMA approvals for a CBD medicine, and his input will help us achieve our ambition of getting a regulatory approved CBD medicine to market faster and at a lower cost than would otherwise be the case. Mr. Tovey's senior level experience at GW will be invaluable and his commitment to Ananda is a vote of confidence in our approach and our team\n.\"\nChris Tovey commented\n: \"\nIt is my sincere belief that there is still much unfinished business for cannabinoid based medicines and Ananda is the only company I have come across that is approaching this opportunity properly. I believe they are well placed to replicate what we did at GW, in different indications. The opportunities for significant revenues with regulatory approved cannabinoid medicines are huge and Ananda is well placed to create best-in-class products to make a significant difference for patients.\n\"\nMelissa Sturgess, CEO, will give a live Q&A session about Chris joining Ananda via the Company's\nInvestorHub\non 11th April 2025 at 12.30p.m. BST. The Q&A session is open to all existing and potential shareholders.

This data will also be required in regulatory documents for other jurisdictions, such as the Federal Drug Administration in the USA.\nThe next step is to produce the first\nGood Manufacturing Practice (GMP)\nclinical batch of MRX1 for dosing participants in the chemotherapy induced clinical pain trial (CIPN) being led by Professor Marie Fallon at Edinburgh University, the endometriosis clinical trial being led by Dr Lucy Whitaker, also at Edinburgh University and the Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study the Company will be running in Australia.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n:\n\"The detailed and intricate work to ensure our MRX1 CBD drug candidate meets the requirements for MHRA clinical trial approval is progressing well. These workstreams provide the foundations of Ananda's house and must be built properly\n.\n\"\nAbout Ananda Pharma\nAnanda Pharma (AQSE: ANA) is a UK-based biopharmaceutical company developing\nregulatory approved\n, cannabinoid medicines to treat complex, chronic conditions, including epilepsy (trials funded by NHS England and NIHR), endometriosis (funded by NHS Scotland) and chemotherapy pain (funded by NIHR).

The demonstration by MRX1 that it significantly reduced NT-proBNP, a marker of heart failure, in mice provides compelling evidence of MRX1's potential to address the underlying mechanisms of heart failure. As NT-proBNP is a key biomarker recommended by NICE, it will also serve as a critical measure of efficacy in any future human trials we can commission. Ananda is committed to advancing this research into transformative therapies for patients worldwide.\n\"\nThe research was conducted by Dr. Nadine Godsman and Dr. Sarah Walsh at Robert Gordon University (\"RGU\"), Aberdeen, under the guidance of Professor Cherry Wainwright, a member of Ananda's Scientific Advisory Board. In the study, which lasted for 7 weeks, mice were treated with the high fat diet (L-NAME) or a control diet for the entire 7 week period. Two thirds of the high fat diet mice were then dosed with either MRX1 or RGU MRX1 for weeks 6&7 of the study.\nHFpEF accounts for 50% of all heart failure cases\nand has limited treatment options. This study strengthens the evidence that MRX1 could serve as a valuable therapeutic for this challenging condition.\nLegend:\n\u00d8\nControl - NT-proBNP levels in mice not treated with anything\n\u00d8\nVehicle - mice dosed with only the high fat diet\n\u00d8\nMRX1 - mice dosed with the high fat diet and then MRX1\n\u00d8\nRGU MRX - mice dosed with the high fat diet and then an RGU developed MRX1 derivative\nDiagram showing the reduction in NT-proBNP levels in mice dosed with MRX1\n-Ends-\nTo stay abreast of the latest developments at Ananda, we encourage you to follow our social media channels which are:\n\u00b7\nInvestor Hub:\ninvestors.anandadevelopments.com\n\u00b7\nInstagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/anandadevelopments?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\u00b7\nLinkedIn\n:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/anadevelopments/\n\u00b7\nTwitter\n:\nhttps://twitter.com/AnandaPlc\n\u00b7\nInvestor Meet Company:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/ananda-developments-plc/register-investor\n-Ends-\nThe Directors of the Company accept responsibility for the contents of this announcement.\nANANDA DEVELOPMENTS PLC\n+44 (0)7463 686 497\nir@anandadevelopments.com\nChief Executive Officer\nMelissa Sturgess\nFinance Director\nJeremy Sturgess-Smith\nSP ANGEL CORPORATE FINANCE LLP\n+44 (0)20 3470 0470\nCorporate Finance\nRichard Morrison\nCaroline Rowe\nCorporate Broking\nAbigail Wayne\nRob Rees\nYellow Jersey PR (media enquiries)\nSarah MacLeod\nCharles Goodwin\nZara McKinlay\n+44 (0)20 3004 9512\nananda@yellowjerseypr.com\nAbout Ananda Developments\nAnanda is an AQSE-listed\nlife sciences company focused on the research and clinical development of CBD-based therapies for a range of complex inflammatory pain conditions.\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://anandadevelopments.com\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information.

With 28 million people in the UK alone dealing with chronic pain and the NHS spending over \u00a35 billion annually on musculoskeletal pain, there is a pressing need for better, more effective treatments as in many of these conditions, which exhibit complex, chronic inflammation and pain, there is significant unmet medical need.\nWe believe in the transformative potential of cannabinoids, supported by a growing body of clinical and real-world evidence. Our commitment is to deliver:\n\u00b7\nRobust clinical trial evidence through partnerships with world-leading researchers and key opinion leaders\n\u00b7\nThe highest quality cannabinoid medicines, manufactured to the strictest pharmaceutical standards\n\u00b7\nLicensed cannabinoid medicines available initially on the NHS before looking to the global market\nOur patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation is being used in two fully funded Phase II randomised controlled trials into:\n\u00b7\nchemotherapy induced nerve pain; and\n\u00b7\nendometriosis\nAs announced earlier this month our\npatent-pending MRX2 and MRX2T CBD and CBD + tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) formulations have been selected as the active pharmaceutical ingredients in two funded Phase III randomised controlled trials\ninto:\n\u00b7\nrefractory (drug-resistant) early onset epilepsies; and\n\u00b7\nrefractory genetic generalised epilepsies\nIn these trials, which are funded by NIHR and NHS England, researchers will study whether MRX2 & MRX2T are safe and effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures experienced by people with epilepsy, as well as their effects on learning, sleep, behaviour, quality of life, stress, and anxiety.\nThe two studies will be the world's first double blind randomised controlled trials to investigate the use of CBD and THC together for epilepsy, and the first to evaluate the medicines in children and adults who have a broad range of difficult-to-treat epilepsies. Previously, double blind randomised controlled trials investigated the use of CBD-only in three rare conditions associated with drug-resistant epilepsy (Dravet Syndrome, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex).\nOver 18 months, 500 patients will be recruited across the UK at multiple NHS sites. The patients will be randomly assigned either CBD, a combination of CBD and THC, or a matched placebo supplied by\nAnanda Developments plc\n. The formulations being used for the trials are Ananda's patent pending MRX2 (CBD) Oral Solution, MRX2T (CBD + THC) Oral Solution, and a matched placebo. The scale and design of the Phase III trials will provide a greater understanding of both the benefits and potential risks of MRX2 and MRX2T as new treatments.\nAlso announced after the end of the period, our patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation is to undergo pharmacokinetic assessment in a Phase I study.\nAlso announced during the period, positive pre-clinical study results were received for our patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation in the potential treatment of\nHeart Fibrosis with Preserved Ejection Fraction\n.\nWe continue to investigate trials in other conditions including Heart Fibrosis with Preserved Ejection Fraction, as we aim to build a comprehensive pre-clinical pipeline.\nDuring the 6 months to 31 July 2024, the team focused on advancing the two Phase II clinical trials. This involved work to ensure a robust supply chain for the manufacture of the investigative medicines, writing the Investigator Brochure and Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier for the patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation, obtaining quotes for the pharmacokinetic study, liaising with the clinical trial teams at the University of Edinburgh and preparing submissions to the ethics committee in advance of dosing. Ethics approval is a key step towards dosing commencing in trial patients.\nWe have also been assessing regulatory, market access and pricing strategies with support of independent specialist advisors. We are working to ensure the clinical trials programme is designed in a way that is most likely to lead to marketing authorisations and healthcare provider uptake, principally via the NHS in the UK and in other countries.\nDuring the period we announced the formation of Ananda's Scientific Advisory Board. Chaired by Ananda's independent non-executive director Professor Clive Page, we are fortunate to have the added guidance of Professor Trevor Jones and Professor Cherry Wainright as we work towards our objective of delivering licenced CBD drugs to the NHS to treat complex chronic inflammatory pain c",

Investors are invited to submit questions in advance to be answered during the recording at:\nhttps://investors.anandadevelopments.com/link/lyaapy\n.\nThe objective of the trials test the safety and efficacy of Ananda's specific\ncannabidiol\n(CBD) and CBD plus\ntetrahydrocannabinol (\nTHC) formulations for two treatment-resistant epilepsy groups in children and adults. If the results are favourable, they will pave the way for a submission of these medicines to the MHRA and other regulatory bodies for regulatory approval.\nThe trials are being\nfunded by a partnership between NHS England and National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and will be co-led by Professor Finbar O'Callaghan and Professor Helen Cross of University College London (UCL) and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH).\nResearchers will study whether these medicines are safe and effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures experienced by individuals, as well as whether they affect learning, sleep, behaviour, quality of life, stress, and anxiety.\nThese will be the world's first double blind randomised controlled trials to investigate the use of CBD and THC together for epilepsy, and the first to evaluate the medicines in children and adults who have a broad range of difficult-to-treat epilepsies.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nANANDA DEVELOPMENTS PLC\n(\"Ananda\" or the \"Company\")\nPhase 1 Pharmacokinetics Study to be conducted on MRX1\nAnanda Developments plc (AQSE: ANA), a life sciences company focused on the research and clinical development of therapies for a range of complex inflammatory pain conditions, is pleased to announce that it has signed a contract with\nSouthern Star Research Pty Ltd\n('SSR'), a leading Australian Contract Research Organisation, to carry out a Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the pharmacokinetic (\"PK\") profile, tolerability and safety of the Company's lead investigative asset, MRX1.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nContract signed for Phase 1\nPK study\n\u00b7\nThe clinical trial will investigate the PK profile, tolerability and safety of MRX1 in healthy volunteers\n\u00b7\nThe data generated will inform future clinical trials in patients and form an integral part of any future regulatory applications, including with the MHRA in the United Kingdom or FDA in the United States\n\u00b7\nCollected data will form part of Ananda's MRX1 patent estate and wider intellectual property portfolio\n\u00b7\nSignificant financial advantages of running the study in Australia, including an R&D Tax Incentive of up to 43.5% of eligible research and development costs\nAnanda recently posted a blog about the reasons for running a PK study which is available to read\nhere\n,\nthe slides from a recent event regarding the reasons behind running a Phase 1 study in Australia are available\nhere\nand a summary video of this announcement is also available on the Hub alongside the RNS.\nAnanda has elected to conduct this Phase 1 study to provide in-human data on its MRX1 drug candidate, specifically related to\nPK, tolerability, and safety. This data will provide useful background information when discussing MRX1 and the wider Ananda drug development pipeline with potential investors, in partnering discussions with pharmaceutical companies, and with clinician investigators for clinical trials in other indications. Crucially, the study will form a foundational piece of the data package for regulatory filings.\nFurther to this, the findings from the PK study can be used as a key data source for submission of an Investigational New Drug ('IND') application to the Federal Drug Administration ('FDA') in the United States - a key first step to having a drug approved for use in the USA.\nThe next steps for the study are to complete the trial protocol and finalise agreements with a Phase\u00a01 unit that will run the trial site, before progressing to Human Research Ethics Committee (\"HREC\"), and a Clinical Trial Notification will be filed with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australian regulatory body) as well as securing a Good Manufacturing Practice certification of the MRX1 drug batch.\nAbout the MRX1 Phase 1 PK study\nThe study will dose 20 healthy volunteers with MRX1. It will measure PK levels following an acute (single) dose, as well as chronic dosing (where the PK levels will be measured over a period of six days) to investigate the accumulation of MRX1 in the body over the course of the study. The volunteers will be hospitalised for the duration of the study and include equal numbers of males and females.\nConducting the study in Australia\nThe study will be conducted in Australia because it has a vibrant Phase 1 offering and financial advantages. The Australia Tax Office offers a 43.5% cash rebate on all Research & Development work undertaken in Australia. The study will be conducted via Ananda's wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Tiamat Australia Pty Ltd.\nAbout MRX1\nMRX1 is an oil based, orally administered drug candidate which is to be used in two Phase 2 clinical trials, the first evaluating MRX1's efficacy in treating Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (\"CIPN\") and the second study is evaluating efficacy and retention in endometriosis patients. You can read more about the CIPN clinical trial\nhere\nand more about the endometriosis clinical trial\nhere\n.\nMelissa Sturgess, CEO of the Company, commented:\n\"\nThis study represents a significant milestone in MRX1's journey to market, providing us with key data for MRX1's licensed drug development. Working with an excellent company such as Southern Star Research is a reflection of the high quality of work produced by the Ananda team.\nSouthern Star Research's deep expertise in clinical research, particularly in the field of cannabinoids, will complement our own capabilities and accelerate the development of MRX1. We all look forward to updating shareholders as we progress through the deliverables on this project.\n\"\nDr. David Lloyd, Managing Director of Southern Star Research Pty Ltd, commented:\n\"We are t",
