Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nANANDA DEVELOPMENTS PLC\n(\"Ananda\" or the \"Company\")\nPhase 1 Pharmacokinetics Study to be conducted on MRX1\nAnanda Developments plc (AQSE: ANA), a life sciences company focused on the research and clinical development of therapies for a range of complex inflammatory pain conditions, is pleased to announce that it has signed a contract with\nSouthern Star Research Pty Ltd\n('SSR'), a leading Australian Contract Research Organisation, to carry out a Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the pharmacokinetic (\"PK\") profile, tolerability and safety of the Company's lead investigative asset, MRX1.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nContract signed for Phase 1\nPK study\n\u00b7\nThe clinical trial will investigate the PK profile, tolerability and safety of MRX1 in healthy volunteers\n\u00b7\nThe data generated will inform future clinical trials in patients and form an integral part of any future regulatory applications, including with the MHRA in the United Kingdom or FDA in the United States\n\u00b7\nCollected data will form part of Ananda's MRX1 patent estate and wider intellectual property portfolio\n\u00b7\nSignificant financial advantages of running the study in Australia, including an R&D Tax Incentive of up to 43.5% of eligible research and development costs\nAnanda recently posted a blog about the reasons for running a PK study which is available to read\nhere\n,\nthe slides from a recent event regarding the reasons behind running a Phase 1 study in Australia are available\nhere\nand a summary video of this announcement is also available on the Hub alongside the RNS.\nAnanda has elected to conduct this Phase 1 study to provide in-human data on its MRX1 drug candidate, specifically related to\nPK, tolerability, and safety. This data will provide useful background information when discussing MRX1 and the wider Ananda drug development pipeline with potential investors, in partnering discussions with pharmaceutical companies, and with clinician investigators for clinical trials in other indications. Crucially, the study will form a foundational piece of the data package for regulatory filings.\nFurther to this, the findings from the PK study can be used as a key data source for submission of an Investigational New Drug ('IND') application to the Federal Drug Administration ('FDA') in the United States - a key first step to having a drug approved for use in the USA.\nThe next steps for the study are to complete the trial protocol and finalise agreements with a Phase\u00a01 unit that will run the trial site, before progressing to Human Research Ethics Committee (\"HREC\"), and a Clinical Trial Notification will be filed with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australian regulatory body) as well as securing a Good Manufacturing Practice certification of the MRX1 drug batch.\nAbout the MRX1 Phase 1 PK study\nThe study will dose 20 healthy volunteers with MRX1. It will measure PK levels following an acute (single) dose, as well as chronic dosing (where the PK levels will be measured over a period of six days) to investigate the accumulation of MRX1 in the body over the course of the study. The volunteers will be hospitalised for the duration of the study and include equal numbers of males and females.\nConducting the study in Australia\nThe study will be conducted in Australia because it has a vibrant Phase 1 offering and financial advantages. The Australia Tax Office offers a 43.5% cash rebate on all Research & Development work undertaken in Australia. The study will be conducted via Ananda's wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Tiamat Australia Pty Ltd.\nAbout MRX1\nMRX1 is an oil based, orally administered drug candidate which is to be used in two Phase 2 clinical trials, the first evaluating MRX1's efficacy in treating Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (\"CIPN\") and the second study is evaluating efficacy and retention in endometriosis patients. You can read more about the CIPN clinical trial\nhere\nand more about the endometriosis clinical trial\nhere\n.\nMelissa Sturgess, CEO of the Company, commented:\n\"\nThis study represents a significant milestone in MRX1's journey to market, providing us with key data for MRX1's licensed drug development. Working with an excellent company such as Southern Star Research is a reflection of the high quality of work produced by the Ananda team.\nSouthern Star Research's deep expertise in clinical research, particularly in the field of cannabinoids, will complement our own capabilities and accelerate the development of MRX1. We all look forward to updating shareholders as we progress through the deliverables on this project.\n\"\nDr. David Lloyd, Managing Director of Southern Star Research Pty Ltd, commented:\n\"We are t"

The trials will be run by investigators at University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nMRX formulations will be used as the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) in two NIHR/NHS funded Phase IIIa randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the treatment of complex epilepsies\n\u00b7\nTrial 1: MRX2 (CBD), MRX2T (CBD + THC) versus placebo in patients with refractory (drug-resistant) early onset epilepsies.\n\u00b7\nTrial 2: MRX2 (CBD), MRX2T (CBD + THC) versus placebo in patients of normal cognitive ability with refractory genetic generalised epilepsies.\n\u00b7\nThe study has been designed to support a marketing authorisation application for MRX2 & MRX2T and therefore, should the trials deliver successful results, MRX intends to progress further regulatory and commercial development activities of these medicines\n\u00b7\nExisting evidence suggests cannabis-based medicinal products are promising treatments for difficult to treat epilepsies, with one CBD-only medicine already licenced to treat three rare conditions associated with drug-resistant epilepsy\n\u00b7\nIn combination, the trials will involve up to 500 patients from across the UK and together, will be\nthe largest investigational trials conducted to date for cannabinoids as a treatment for refractory epilepsy\n\u00b7\nAnanda will be paid to supply MRX2, MRX2T and the matching placebo\n\u00b7\nA pre-recorded video relating to this news,\nis available for viewing via the Company's investor hub\nand Ananda's Finance Director Jeremy Sturgess-Smith will be recording a Q&A specific to these trials in a week. Investors are invited to submit questions in advance to be answered during the recording at:\nhttps://investors.anandadevelopments.com/link/lyaapy\n.\nThe objective of the trials test the safety and efficacy of Ananda's specific\ncannabidiol\n(CBD) and CBD plus\ntetrahydrocannabinol (\nTHC) formulations for two treatment-resistant epilepsy groups in children and adults. If the results are favourable, they will pave the way for a submission of these medicines to the MHRA and other regulatory bodies for regulatory approval.\nThe trials are being\nfunded by a partnership between NHS England and National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and will be co-led by Professor Finbar O'Callaghan and Professor Helen Cross of University College London (UCL) and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH).\nResearchers will study whether these medicines are safe and effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures experienced by individuals, as well as whether they affect learning, sleep, behaviour, quality of life, stress, and anxiety.\nThese will be the world's first double blind randomised controlled trials to investigate the use of CBD and THC together for epilepsy, and the first to evaluate the medicines in children and adults who have a broad range of difficult-to-treat epilepsies. Previously, double blind randomised controlled trials investigated the use of CBD-only in three rare conditions associated with drug-resistant epilepsy (Dravet Syndrome, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex).\n500 patients will be recruited across the UK at multiple NHS sites. The patients will be randomly assigned either CBD, a combination of CBD and THC, or a matched placebo manufactured to the specifications of\nAnanda Developments plc\n's\nformulations, which patients will take for 24 weeks\n. The formulations being used for the trials are Ananda's patent pending MRX2 (CBD) Oral Solution, MRX2T (CBD + THC) Oral Solution, and a matched placebo. The scale and design of the Phase IIIa trials will provide a greater understanding of both the benefits and potential risks of MRX2 and MRX2T as new treatments.\nNICE has estimated that the combined direct and indirect costs of epilepsy to the NHS are \u00a32 billion per annum and most of this is spent on patients with refractory epilepsy.\nAnanda's CEO, Melissa Sturgess commented\n: \"\nThe UK Government and the NHS have made it clear they need to see randomised controlled trials in a broad range of seizure types and\nepilepsies\nto enable wide prescribing of CBD- and THC-based medicines. We are proud that our\nMRX2\nand\nMRX2T products\nmeet the rigorous requirements for\nthese trials and have received the support of\ninternationally respected\nclinician investigators\nwith expertise i"

With 28 million people in the UK alone dealing with chronic pain and the NHS spending over \u00a35 billion annually on musculoskeletal pain, there is a pressing need for better, more effective treatments as in many of these conditions, which exhibit complex, chronic inflammation and pain, there is significant unmet medical need.\nWe believe in the transformative potential of cannabinoids, supported by a growing body of clinical and real-world evidence. Our commitment is to deliver:\n\u00b7\nRobust clinical trial evidence through partnerships with world-leading researchers and key opinion leaders\n\u00b7\nThe highest quality cannabinoid medicines, manufactured to the strictest pharmaceutical standards\n\u00b7\nLicensed cannabinoid medicines available initially on the NHS before looking to the global market\nOur patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation is being used in two fully funded Phase II randomised controlled trials into:\n\u00b7\nchemotherapy induced nerve pain; and\n\u00b7\nendometriosis\nAs announced earlier this month our\npatent-pending MRX2 and MRX2T CBD and CBD + tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) formulations have been selected as the active pharmaceutical ingredients in two funded Phase III randomised controlled trials\ninto:\n\u00b7\nrefractory (drug-resistant) early onset epilepsies; and\n\u00b7\nrefractory genetic generalised epilepsies\nIn these trials, which are funded by NIHR and NHS England, researchers will study whether MRX2 & MRX2T are safe and effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures experienced by people with epilepsy, as well as their effects on learning, sleep, behaviour, quality of life, stress, and anxiety.\nThe two studies will be the world's first double blind randomised controlled trials to investigate the use of CBD and THC together for epilepsy, and the first to evaluate the medicines in children and adults who have a broad range of difficult-to-treat epilepsies. Previously, double blind randomised controlled trials investigated the use of CBD-only in three rare conditions associated with drug-resistant epilepsy (Dravet Syndrome, Lennox Gastaut Syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex).\nOver 18 months, 500 patients will be recruited across the UK at multiple NHS sites. The patients will be randomly assigned either CBD, a combination of CBD and THC, or a matched placebo supplied by\nAnanda Developments plc\n. The formulations being used for the trials are Ananda's patent pending MRX2 (CBD) Oral Solution, MRX2T (CBD + THC) Oral Solution, and a matched placebo. The scale and design of the Phase III trials will provide a greater understanding of both the benefits and potential risks of MRX2 and MRX2T as new treatments.\nAlso announced after the end of the period, our patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation is to undergo pharmacokinetic assessment in a Phase I study.\nAlso announced during the period, positive pre-clinical study results were received for our patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation in the potential treatment of\nHeart Fibrosis with Preserved Ejection Fraction\n.\nWe continue to investigate trials in other conditions including Heart Fibrosis with Preserved Ejection Fraction, as we aim to build a comprehensive pre-clinical pipeline.\nDuring the 6 months to 31 July 2024, the team focused on advancing the two Phase II clinical trials. This involved work to ensure a robust supply chain for the manufacture of the investigative medicines, writing the Investigator Brochure and Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier for the patent-pending MRX1 CBD formulation, obtaining quotes for the pharmacokinetic study, liaising with the clinical trial teams at the University of Edinburgh and preparing submissions to the ethics committee in advance of dosing. Ethics approval is a key step towards dosing commencing in trial patients.\nWe have also been assessing regulatory, market access and pricing strategies with support of independent specialist advisors. We are working to ensure the clinical trials programme is designed in a way that is most likely to lead to marketing authorisations and healthcare provider uptake, principally via the NHS in the UK and in other countries.\nDuring the period we announced the formation of Ananda's Scientific Advisory Board. Chaired by Ananda's independent non-executive director Professor Clive Page, we are fortunate to have the added guidance of Professor Trevor Jones and Professor Cherry Wainright as we work towards our objective of delivering licenced CBD drugs to the NHS to treat complex chronic inflammatory pain c"
