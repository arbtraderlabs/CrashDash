In a highly competitive market, our priority is to deliver the best possible game we can to meet player's expectations, even if that means a longer development cycle and shifting the release date.\nAs at 31 December 2025, the Company had over $4 million in cash, demonstrating disciplined cash management.\nCash and cash equivalents will continue to fluctuate during 2026, as revenue is expected to improve following the launch of certain high-potential new games.\nThe Company has no borrowings.\nPipeline\nThe positive momentum we are seeing at tinyBuild is translating into a strong performance in terms of wishlists, one of the most important indicators for future sales:\nKingmakers\nis now in the #7 Most Wishlisted Games on Steam,\nSAND\n#47,\nStreets of Rogue 2\n#88 and\nThe Lift\n#144. Recently announced\nHozy\nand\nRestory\nare also attracting good sized audiences.\nThe release schedule remains heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, with only\nHozy\nand\nSAND\ncurrently scheduled for the first half of the year. To mitigate the risk with new launches, we are fully focused on cost control and regularly reviewing our investment in new games to align them with audience validation.\nOutlook\nThe pipeline for 2026 and beyond is strong, it includes several larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous investment in the catalogue, including updates, DLCs and platform launches.\nThe evolving global macroeconomic situation, and the continued conflict in Ukraine, impose caution and vigilance in the medium and long term. In particular, tinyBuild carefully assesses the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business.\nAlex Nichiporchik, Chief Executive Officer of tinyBuild, commented:\n\"The longevity of our catalogue increases with every year that goes by - Hello Neighbor into the end of last year was insane. That's down to a great team and amazing partners, and together we've delivered strong results through both new titles and evergreen franchises. I'm excited about 2026 and beyond and I want to thank all the people that make this possible.\"\n\u200b\nEnquiries\n:\ntinyBuild, Inc\nAlex Nichiporchik - Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder\nGiasone (Jaz) Salati - Chief Financial Officer\ninvestorrelations@tinybuild.com\nZeus (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi/ James Edis (Investment Banking)\nBen Robertson (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 203 829 5000\nSEC Newgate (Financial PR)\nRobin Tozer, Harry Handyside\ntinybuild@secnewgate.co.uk\n+44 (0)7540 106366\nAbout tinyBuild:\nFounded in 2013, tinyBuild (AIM: TBLD) is a global video games publisher and developer, with a catalogue of more than 100 premium titles across different genres. tinyBuild's strategy is to focus on its own intellectual property (IP) to build multi-game and multimedia franchises, in partnership with developers.\ntinyBuild is headquartered in the USA with operations stretching across the Americas and Europe.

Funding remains scarce\nand studio closures\nare still being announced as some of the most\nambitious projects\nfall short of expectations, but the worst seems behind us and those that continued\nto\ninvest in new IP may reap well-deserved rewards\n.\nOver the past few years we have refocused on products that connect with audiences, on infinitely re-playable games centred around systems: the one-thousand hour game.\nPlayers validated our strategy with the highest amount of Steam wishlists tinyBuild ever collected on the upcoming pipeline: four games in the top 100 global ranking. As the market evolves, we refined our go-to-market approach using demos and playtests to stay close to our audience ahead of the launch and work hard to fix bugs and prioritise features that affect game reviews after launch. The second edition of tinyBuild Connect last May was another success introducing new playable versions for FEROCIOUS and ALL WILL FALL, and announcing new games such as Trainfort and Hozy.\nIn slowly improving market conditions we\nare\nmaking every effort to remain lean\nand\nnimble, keeping a close eye on our costs, which in turns gives us\nmore\nflexibility on our commercial strategy: we are not afraid to move the release date for a game if we see a strong return on incremental development to meet expectations of increasingly demanding players. Since 2023 lots of work\nhas gone into\nimproving\ninternal processes and\ncommunication:\nownership of each line of budget and timeliness of internal gives everyone more time to act in\nan over-crowded\nindustry.\nIn the first half, back catalogue and own-IP titles contributed 100%\nand\n85% of Gaming revenue, respectively, (H1\n2024:\n89% and\n78\n%), broadly in line with the average of the past five years. The pipeline of new titles has been realigned to maximise the long-term revenue and profitability potential, while maintaining a well-diversified portfolio.\nCurrent portfolio and pipeline\nReleases in\nthe first half of\n2025\n:\n\u25cf\nDeadside\n(console) - Open\u2011world survival shooter with persistent PvPvE (Player Vs Player Vs Environment), base\u2011building and tactical gunplay.\n\u25cf\nLevel Zero: Extraction (version 1.0)\n- An asymmetrical PvPvE extraction shooter that blends survival\u2011horror tension with objective\u2011driven looting and exfiltration.\n\u25cf\nDeep Cuts (VR)\n- A physics\u2011driven VR action\u2011adventure that drops players onto living movie sets, mixing melee, gunplay and light puzzle\u2011solving in a \"play\u2011the\u2011scene\" structure.\nAfter the end of the period, tinyBuild published:\n\u25cf\nThe King is Watching\n- Roguelite kingdom\u2011builder where production only runs under your \"royal gaze,\" creating tight, replayable trade\u2011offs between economy and defence.\n\u25cf\nDrill Core\n(version 1.0) - Strategic 2D \"platform\u2011miner\" sim/ roguelite about running planetary drilling operations, balancing crew management, tech upgrades, and defences against alien threats.\n\u25cf\nDUCKSIDE (console) -\nPersistent\u2011world survival shooter where you literally play as armed ducks, combining PvPvE combat, base\u2011building, and mission\u2011driven progression.\nLooking ahead, tinyBuild has the strongest pipeline it has ever had:\n\u25cf\nKingmakers\n- Action-strategy sandbox where modern firearms and co\u2011op command tools reshape medieval mass battles with thousands of units.\n\u25cf\nHello Neighbor 3\n- Systems\u2011driven stealth\u2011adventure in a simulated open town where emergent puzzles and social AI drive infiltration and escape.\n\u25cf\nFEROCIOUS\n- Survival FPS on a hostile prehistoric island, blending exploration, crafting, and high\u2011intensity firefights against dinosaurs and mercenaries.\n\u25cf\nSAND\n- Open\u2011world PvPvE\nextraction shooter\non a fallen desert planet, anchored by customizable walking\u2011base \"Tramplers\" for traversal, combat, and extraction.\n\u25cf\nALL WILL FALL\n- Physics\u2011driven ocean\u2011city builder where every structure can collapse, forcing disciplined resource management and risk\u2011aware vertical construction.\n\u25cf\nOf Ash and Steel\n- Third\u2011person, low\u2011fantasy open\u2011world RPG emphasizing methodical melee combat, unguided exploration, and old\u2011school progression without quest markers.\n\u25cf\nStreets of Rogue 2\n- Procedural, systems\u2011heavy open world that supports multiple playstyles-sneak, fight, trade, build, or farm-within a chaotic\nimmersive\n\u2011sim sandbox.\n\u25cf\nSpeedRunners 2\n- Competitive side\u2011scrolling racing/platformer sequel with 8\u2011player lobbies and a new 64\u2011player tournament format for large\u2011scale events.\n\u25cf\nTrainfort\n- Co\u2011op\nsurvival\n\u2011crafting game about dwarven nomads building a mobile train\u2011base to traverse a vast, post\u2011apocalyptic world in search of resources.\n\u25cf\nHozy\n- Cozy renovation sim focused on cleaning, refurbishing, and decorating neglected interiors with straightforward tools and high \"before/after\" payoff.\n\u25cf\nI Am Future\n(console) - Cozy post-apocalyptic survival/crafting on flooded city rooftops; build and decorate a base, farm and fish, tinker with gadgets, and automate chores with helper robots.\n\u25cf\nVOIN\n(version 1.0) - Fast first\u2011person hack\u2011and\u2011slash action\u2011RPG with loot\u2011driven builds and expanding regions like the \"Permafrost\" zone adding progression and late\u2011game challenges.\nInvesting and innovating for growth\nThe\nGroup continuously reviews the allocation of\nresources to maximise the\npotential\nof each game during the development process.\nSince before the IPO, tinyBuild's mantra has been to\nmaintain\na well-diversified portfolio of own-IP that can be scaled into cross-media franchises, and we remain loyal to that.\nStrict discipline on investments goes hand in hand with\nnimble and decentralised structure\n. At a time when most are re-trenching on their catalogue, the Company proved it\nis capable of delivering high-quality\nnew-IP\nand\nminimise the setbacks. The launch of\nThe King is Watching\nis a\ngood example of how\nthe Company's\nsophisticated marketing strategy can attract a large audience even for a brand-new franchise.\nOur\nfocus has been on cash generation and financial stability. The executive team\nis\nmore selective about signing up new titles, while an uncertain macroeconomic environment\ncreates many opportunities. The disposal of Red Cerberus (2 April 2025) refocused the Company on its' core competencies, with more direct investments in high-\npotential studios.\nPeople\nExcluding the disposal of Red Cerberus, the number of staff remained broadly stable in 2025 at\nnearly 200.\nProject and budget ownership means it is even easier to spot and reward talent across the Group, which translates in a high retention rate.\ntinyBuild continues to support all its staff (employees and independent contractors) and their families affected by the war in Ukraine and it continues to carefully monitor the situation. Having helped staff move out of the riskiest areas, the Group remains focused on mental health and administrative support so they can settle in their preferred location across Europe.\nPosition and strategy\ntinyBuild is well-positioned with a strong pipeline of new titles and a proven ability to attract, screen and market high-quality game franchises. Our balanced investment strategy aims at building a diversified portfolio of high-potential own-IP, and our multimedia franchise model allows us to extend the life of our IP, maximising our return on investment.\nOur medium-term strategy is to expand our position as a leading global video games developer and publisher, focussing on IP ownership while creating long-term scalable franchises across multiple media formats.\n2025\nhas seen significant progress towards that ambition, and I would like to thank all of\nour staff for their amazing contribution and\nour shareholders for their support.\nAlex Nichiporchik\nChief Executive Officer\n16\nSeptember 2025\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nResults for the six months ended June 2025 were\nahead of\nexpectations,\nin a market that remains extremely competitive. The\nGroup\ncontinued\nto strengthen its financial position\n, including the disposal of Red Cerberus (QA subsidiary in Brazil), and had\n$4.6m in cash and cash equivalents (no debt\n) at the end of the period.\nRevenue\nIn the six months to June 2025, tinyBuild revenues from continuing operations\n(excluding Red Cerberus)\nwere $17.0m,\nbroadly even\ncompared to the previous period (H1 2024: $16.8m\n).\nBack catalogue performed\nparticularly\nstrongly in the first half,\nwith the successful release of Deadside on console,\nsupported by over\n90\ntitles and by well-established franchises such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, Potion Craft and Streets of Rogue. Revenue from events, primarily DevGAMM,\nincreased slightly\nat $0.\n8m\nas the Group consolidated\nits presence\nin Central and Western Europe.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Operating Profit\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented net of amortisation of development costs, excluding impairment of development costs, share-based compensation expenses, exceptional costs (e.g. legal costs related to M&A) and other operating income, giving a clear yet conservative picture of the business progression. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\nfor H1 2025\nwas positive $4.2\nm\n($2.3m loss in H1 of 2024), reflecting\nstable revenues, a more favourable revenue mix (85% own-IP revenues Vs 78% in H1 2024) and the full benefit of a\nlower\ncost\nbase,\nalong with lower\namortisation of development costs\n($\n3.9m in H1 2025 vs $4.5m in H1 2024).\nOperating profit from continuing operations for H1 2025 was positive $3.6\nm\n(H1 2024: $6.6m loss), after accounting for the $1.1m impairment of development costs (H1 2024: $3.0m). Excluding the impairment charges, a higher EBITDA is derived by lower general and administrative expenses ($7.3m in H1 2025 compared with $10.5m in H1 2024) following the reduction in workforce undertaken in 2024.\nFinance costs and taxation\nAs the Group carries no debt, finance costs were immaterial in H1 2025. Taxation charges were $0.\n3m\n(H1 2024: $0.3m).\nImpairment\nIn H1 2025, tinyBuild incurred $1.1m charges relating to the impairment of development costs ($3.0m in H1 2024).\nCash Flow\nCash flows from operating activities were $6.8m ($2.0m in H1 2024), including a $3.0\nm\ndecrease in net working capital (H1 2024: $1.4m decrease). Software development costs, mainly consisting of developer salaries, advances, localisation and porting, decreased 29% to $6.2m ($8.7m in H1 2024), reflecting the rationalisation in investment for upcoming pipeline releases.\nEmployee incentive plan and EBT update\nThe Employee Benefit Trust continued to hold a total of 3,937,587 ordinary shares as at\n16\nSeptember 2025. The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy potential share awards and future option exercises, once vested.\nAs previously announced, the Remuneration Committee of tinyBuild intends to utilise share awards to incentivise and retain key employees and executive directors and further announcements are expected to be made in the near term. The share awards not only encourage share ownership and stakeholder alignment in the business but also serves to preserve cash resources that would otherwise be used by the Company to satisfy bonus awards.\nFinancial Position\nThe net cash position at the end of June 2025 was $4.6m ($3.1m at the end of December 2024), with the majority of the variation driven by the $1.0m net proceeds from the

CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n1\nGENERAL INFORMATION\ntinyBuild Inc. (\"the Company\") is a public company limited by shares, and is registered, domiciled and incorporated in Delaware, USA. The address of the registered office is 1239 120th Ave NE, Suite A, Bellevue, WA 98005, United States.\nThe Group (\"the Group\") consists of tinyBuild Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. The Group's principal activity is that of an indie video game publisher and developer.\nThe Board of Directors approved this interim financial information on 16 September 2025.\n2\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThese condensed, consolidated financial statements for the interim half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'. These interim financial statements do not constitute full financial statements and do not include all the notes of the type normally included in annual financial statements. Accordingly, these financial statements are to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"). The Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2024 have been issued and are available on the Group's investor relations' website: https://www.tinybuildinvestors.com/documents-and-presentations.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for, where disclosed in the accounting policies, certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. The financial statements are prepared in US Dollars, which is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Group. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand US Dollars (US$'000).\nTax charged within the\nsix\nmonths ended 30 June 2025 has been calculated by applying the effective rate of tax which is expected to apply to the Group for the year ending 31 December 2025 as required by IAS 34.\nWith the exception of the new standard set out below, the Group has applied the same accounting policies and methods of computation in its interim consolidated financial statements as in its 31 December 2024 annual financial statements.\nStandard/amendment\nEffective date\nAmendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability\n1 January 2025\nThe above standard, that will apply for the first time in the next annual financial statements,\nhas\nnot\nhad\na material impact on the Group.\nGoing concern\nThe Group remains in a significant net asset position of $41.8m at the reporting date. The Group continues to have no borrowings and has cash and cash equivalents of $4.6m at the reporting date. Generating further funds through the sale of intellectual property remains an option for the Group. Furthermore, the Group has a number of high-potential games in the pipeline, which are anticipated to contribute to organic revenue growth in the second half of FY25 and beyond. Having considered the information available and recent changes to the business, the Directors have concluded that there are no material uncertainties related to events or conditions that might cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n3\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nIn April 2025, the Group disposed of Red Cerberus LLC, together with its subsidiary Red Cerberus Brasil LTDA. Accordingly, these subsidiaries have been classified as discontinued operations in the current period. In line with the requirements of IFRS 5, the results of these subsidiaries have been presented within discontinued operations for the current and comparative periods.\nThe results of the discontinued operations, which have been included in the profit for the 6 month period presented, are as follows:\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nRevenue\n329\n2,071\n4,261\nCost of sales\n123\n(1,039)\n(2,698)\nAdministrative expenses\n(465)\n(624)\n(1,834)\nFinance income\n2\n7\n11\nFinance costs\n-\n(20)\n-\n(Loss)/profit before tax from ordinary activities\n(11)\n395\n(260)\nLoss on disposal of subsidiaries\n(482)\n-\n-\n(Loss)/profit before tax from discontinued operations\n(494)\n395\n(260)\nIncome tax\n(72)\n-\n(66)\n(Loss)/profit for the year from discontinued operations\n(565)\n395\n(326)\nThe pre-tax loss on disposal of subsidiaries was determined as follows:\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n$'000\nCash consideration received\n1,296\nCash disposed of\n(308)\nNet cash inflow on disposal of subsidiaries\n988\nNet assets disposed other than cash:\nIntangible assets\n(355)\nProperty, plant and equipment - owned\n(252)\nProperty, plant and equipment - leased\n(229)\nTrade and other receivables\n(1,319)\nTrade and other payables\n438\nLease liabilities\n248\n(1,470)\nPre-tax loss on disposal of subsidiaries\n(482)\nThe cashflows from discontinued operations included in the consolidated cash flow statement for the year 2025 and 2024 are as follows:\nCash flows from / (used in) discontinued operations\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nNet cash inflow from / (used in) operating activities\n227\n658\n1\nNet cash from investing activities (including cash inflows from the sale of subsidiaries)\n-\n(9)\n(15)\nNet cash (used in) / inflow from financing activities\n-\n-\n-\n227\n649\n(14)\n4\nREVENUE\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nAn analysis of the Group's revenue is as follows:\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nRevenue analysed by class of business\nGame and merchandise royalties\n16,129\n16,837\n29,861\nDevelopment services\n100\n(663)\n(805)\nEvents\n752\n590\n1,382\n16,980\n16,764\n30,438\nRevenue from development services is stated net of a true up adjustment of $nil for the period ended 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: $1,092,000, 31 December 2024: $1,092,000).\n5\nSEGMENTAL REPORTING\nIFRS 8 'Operating Segments' requires that operating segments be identified on the basis of internal reporting and decision-making. The Group identifies operating segments based on internal management reporting that is regularly reported to and reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is identified as the chief operating decision maker. Management information is reported as one operating segment, being revenue from self-published franchises and other revenue streams such as royalties, licensing, development and events.\nWhilst the chief operating decision maker assessed there to be only one segment, the Group's portfolio of games is split between those based on IP owned by the Group and those based on IP owned by a third party, therefore to aid the readers' understanding of our results, the split of revenue from these two categories is shown below.\nGame and merchandise royalties\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nOwned IP\n13,762\n13,070\n23,107\nThird-party IP\n2,367\n3,767\n6,756\n16,129\n16,837\n29,861\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025, three\ncustomers were responsible for approximately 81% of the Group's revenues (30 June 2024: four - 75%, 31 December 2024: three - 68%).\nThree\ncustomers were responsible for approximately 71%\nof the Group's accounts receivable balance (30 June 202\n4: four - 43%, 31 December 2024: four - 68%).\nAs at 30 June 2025, the\nGroup has one right-of-use asset located overseas with a carrying value of $117,000 (30 June 2024: seven - $516,000, 31 December 2024: five - $374,000).\nAs at 30 June 2025 the\nGroup also has tangible fixed assets located overseas with a total carrying value of $nil (30 June 2024: $397,000, 31 December 2024: $291,552). The reduction is due to the disposal of Red Cerberus LLC, see note 3. All other non-current assets are located in the US.\n6 EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Group reports basic and diluted earnings per common share. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to common shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, which excludes any treasury shares held by the Group.\nDiluted earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, taking into account the effects of all potential dilutive common shares, including options.\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nProfit/(loss) attributable to the owners of the Group\n2,690\n(6,581)\n(20,522)\nWeighted average number of shares\n397,219,319\n369,513,019\n383,484,707\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share ($)\n0.\n007\n(0.018)\n(0.054)\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nProfit/(\nloss\n)\nattributable to the owners of the Group\n2,690\n(6,581)\n(20,522)\nWeighted average number of shares\n397,219,319\n369,513,019\n383,484,707\nDilutive effect of share options\n-\n-\n-\nDilutive effect of warrants\n-\n-\n-\nWeighted average number of diluted shares\n397,219,319\n369,513,019\n383,484,707\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share ($)\n0.\n007\n(0.018)\n(0.054)\nThere are 2,078,083 options outstanding at period end (30 June 2024: 2,837,095 and 31 December 2024: 2,078,084) and 1,511,449 warrants outstanding at period end (30 June 2024: 1,511,449 and 31 December 2024: 1,511,449). The options and warrants are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the periods ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024, and the year ended 31 December 2024 because they are antidilutive.\nPursuant to IAS 33 'Earnings per Share', options whose exercise price is higher than the value of the Group's security were not taken into account in determining the effect of dilutive instruments. The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.\n7\nALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe Directors of the Group have presented the performance measure 'Adjusted EBITDA' as they monitor this performance measure at a consolidated level and they believe this measure is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting profit from continuing operations to exclude the impact of taxation, net finance costs, share-based payment expenses, depreciation, impairment of intangible assets, amortisation of purchased intellectual property, acquisition costs, legal and professional costs associated with the purchase of subsidiaries and intellectual property, Ukraine-related expenses and fair value gains on contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined performance measure in IFRS. The Group's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and disclosures by other entities.\nAmortisation of $3.9m (30 June 2024: $4.5m, 31 December 2024: $10.5m) of software development costs has been included in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA, as they are a primary cost in the Group's ordinary course of business.\nAccrued royalties of $1.7m (30 June 2024: $nil, 31 December 2024: $2.3m) have been derecognised as part of a legal settlement. This release of accrued royalties is included as a reduction in royalty expenses within cost of sales. It relates to the second step in the renegotiation of a specific contract and is not expected to recur, therefore it has been deducted in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA.\n6 months ended\n30 June 2025\n6 months ended\n30 June 2024\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nProfit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations\n3,286\n(6,881)\n(20,268)\nIncome tax expense\n309\n323\n267\nFinance costs\n14\n42\n27\nFinance income\n-\n(60)\n(133)\nShare-based payment expenses\n110\n102\n147\nAmortisation of purchased intellectual property, brands and customer relationships\n1,545\n1,758\n3,291\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n85\n303\n424\nImpairment of development costs and other intangible assets\n1,081\n3,028\n13,663\nRelease of accrued royalties\n(1,700)\n-\n(2,269)\nOther operating income\n(500)\n(137)\n(1,024)\nGain on disposal of intangible assets\n-\n(773)\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\n4,230\n(2,295)\n(5,875)\n8 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nBrands\nCustomer relationships\nPurchased intellectual property\nSoftware development costs\nTotal\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nCost:\nAs at 1 January 2024\n13,202\n1,815\n4,261\n29,966\n97,183\n146,427\nAdditions - internally generated\n-\n-\n-\n-\n19,315\n19,315\nDisposals\n-\n-\n-\n(2,000)\n(1,159)\n(3,159)\nAs at 31 December 2024\n13,202\n1,815\n4,261\n27,966\n115,339\n162,583\nAdditions - internally generated\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6,245\n6,245\nDisposals\n(5,960)\n-\n(4,261)\n-\n-\n(10,221)\nAs at 30 June 2025\n7,242\n1,815\n-\n27,966\n121,584\n158,607\nAmortisation and impairment:\nAs at 1 January 2024\n13,202\n879\n3,786\n13,868\n63,180\n94,915\nAmortisation charge for the year - continuing operations\n-\n73\n-\n3,219\n10,504\n13,796\nAmortisation\ncharge for the period - discontinued operations\n-\n-\n97\n-\n-\n97\nImpairment charge for the year\n-\n-\n-\n-\n13,663\n13,663\nDisposals\n-\n-\n-\n(510)\n(1,128)\n(1,638)\nAs at 31 December 2024\n13,202\n952\n3,883\n16,577\n86,219\n120,833\nAmortisation charge for the period - continuing operations\n-\n36\n-\n1,545\n3,921\n5,502\nAmortisation\ncharge for the period - discontinued operations\n-\n-\n24\n-\n-\n24\nImpairment charge for the period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,081\n1,081\nDisposals\n(5,960)\n-\n(3,907)\n-\n-\n(9,867)\nAs at 30 June 2025\n7,242\n988\n-\n18,122\n91,221\n117,573\nCarrying amount:\nAs at 30 June 2025\n-\n827\n-\n9,844\n30,363\n41,034\nAs at 31 December 2024\n-\n863\n378\n11,389\n29,120\n41,750\nDuring\nH1\n2025, the Group has recorded impairment losses of $1.1m\nagainst the carrying value of software development costs.
