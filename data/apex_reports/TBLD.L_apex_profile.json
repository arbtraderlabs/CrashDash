In a highly competitive market, our priority is to deliver the best possible game we can to meet player's expectations, even if that means a longer development cycle and shifting the release date.\nAs at 31 December 2025, the Company had over $4 million in cash, demonstrating disciplined cash management.\nCash and cash equivalents will continue to fluctuate during 2026, as revenue is expected to improve following the launch of certain high-potential new games.\nThe Company has no borrowings.\nPipeline\nThe positive momentum we are seeing at tinyBuild is translating into a strong performance in terms of wishlists, one of the most important indicators for future sales:\nKingmakers\nis now in the #7 Most Wishlisted Games on Steam,\nSAND\n#47,\nStreets of Rogue 2\n#88 and\nThe Lift\n#144. Recently announced\nHozy\nand\nRestory\nare also attracting good sized audiences.\nThe release schedule remains heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, with only\nHozy\nand\nSAND\ncurrently scheduled for the first half of the year. To mitigate the risk with new launches, we are fully focused on cost control and regularly reviewing our investment in new games to align them with audience validation.\nOutlook\nThe pipeline for 2026 and beyond is strong, it includes several larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous investment in the catalogue, including updates, DLCs and platform launches.\nThe evolving global macroeconomic situation, and the continued conflict in Ukraine, impose caution and vigilance in the medium and long term. In particular, tinyBuild carefully assesses the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business.\nAlex Nichiporchik, Chief Executive Officer of tinyBuild, commented:\n\"The longevity of our catalogue increases with every year that goes by - Hello Neighbor into the end of last year was insane. That's down to a great team and amazing partners, and together we've delivered strong results through both new titles and evergreen franchises. I'm excited about 2026 and beyond and I want to thank all the people that make this possible.\"\n\u200b\nEnquiries\n:\ntinyBuild, Inc\nAlex Nichiporchik - Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder\nGiasone (Jaz) Salati - Chief Financial Officer\ninvestorrelations@tinybuild.com\nZeus (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi/ James Edis (Investment Banking)\nBen Robertson (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 203 829 5000\nSEC Newgate (Financial PR)\nRobin Tozer, Harry Handyside\ntinybuild@secnewgate.co.uk\n+44 (0)7540 106366\nAbout tinyBuild:\nFounded in 2013, tinyBuild (AIM: TBLD) is a global video games publisher and developer, with a catalogue of more than 100 premium titles across different genres. tinyBuild's strategy is to focus on its own intellectual property (IP) to build multi-game and multimedia franchises, in partnership with developers.\ntinyBuild is headquartered in the USA with operations stretching across the Americas and Europe.

Funding remains scarce\nand studio closures\nare still being announced as some of the most\nambitious projects\nfall short of expectations, but the worst seems behind us and those that continued\nto\ninvest in new IP may reap well-deserved rewards\n.\nOver the past few years we have refocused on products that connect with audiences, on infinitely re-playable games centred around systems: the one-thousand hour game.\nPlayers validated our strategy with the highest amount of Steam wishlists tinyBuild ever collected on the upcoming pipeline: four games in the top 100 global ranking. As the market evolves, we refined our go-to-market approach using demos and playtests to stay close to our audience ahead of the launch and work hard to fix bugs and prioritise features that affect game reviews after launch. The second edition of tinyBuild Connect last May was another success introducing new playable versions for FEROCIOUS and ALL WILL FALL, and announcing new games such as Trainfort and Hozy.\nIn slowly improving market conditions we\nare\nmaking every effort to remain lean\nand\nnimble, keeping a close eye on our costs, which in turns gives us\nmore\nflexibility on our commercial strategy: we are not afraid to move the release date for a game if we see a strong return on incremental development to meet expectations of increasingly demanding players. Since 2023 lots of work\nhas gone into\nimproving\ninternal processes and\ncommunication:\nownership of each line of budget and timeliness of internal gives everyone more time to act in\nan over-crowded\nindustry.\nIn the first half, back catalogue and own-IP titles contributed 100%\nand\n85% of Gaming revenue, respectively, (H1\n2024:\n89% and\n78\n%), broadly in line with the average of the past five years. The pipeline of new titles has been realigned to maximise the long-term revenue and profitability potential, while maintaining a well-diversified portfolio.\nCurrent portfolio and pipeline\nReleases in\nthe first half of\n2025\n:\n\u25cf\nDeadside\n(console) - Open\u2011world survival shooter with persistent PvPvE (Player Vs Player Vs Environment), base\u2011building and tactical gunplay.\n\u25cf\nLevel Zero: Extraction (version 1.0)\n- An asymmetrical PvPvE extraction shooter that blends survival\u2011horror tension with objective\u2011driven looting and exfiltration.\n\u25cf\nDeep Cuts (VR)\n- A physics\u2011driven VR action\u2011adventure that drops players onto living movie sets, mixing melee, gunplay and light puzzle\u2011solving in a \"play\u2011the\u2011scene\" structure.\nAfter the end of the period, tinyBuild published:\n\u25cf\nThe King is Watching\n- Roguelite kingdom\u2011builder where production only runs under your \"royal gaze,\" creating tight, replayable trade\u2011offs between economy and defence.\n\u25cf\nDrill Core\n(version 1.0) - Strategic 2D \"platform\u2011miner\" sim/ roguelite about running planetary drilling operations, balancing crew management, tech upgrades, and defences against alien threats.\n\u25cf\nDUCKSIDE (console) -\nPersistent\u2011world survival shooter where you literally play as armed ducks, combining PvPvE combat, base\u2011building, and mission\u2011driven progression.\nLooking ahead, tinyBuild has the strongest pipeline it has ever had:\n\u25cf\nKingmakers\n- Action-strategy sandbox where modern firearms and co\u2011op command tools reshape medieval mass battles with thousands of units.\n\u25cf\nHello Neighbor 3\n- Systems\u2011driven stealth\u2011adventure in a simulated open town where emergent puzzles and social AI drive infiltration and escape.\n\u25cf\nFEROCIOUS\n- Survival FPS on a hostile prehistoric island, blending exploration, crafting, and high\u2011intensity firefights against dinosaurs and mercenaries.\n\u25cf\nSAND\n- Open\u2011world PvPvE\nextraction shooter\non a fallen desert planet, anchored by customizable walking\u2011base \"Tramplers\" for traversal, combat, and extraction.\n\u25cf\nALL WILL FALL\n- Physics\u2011driven ocean\u2011city builder where every structure can collapse, forcing disciplined resource management and risk\u2011aware vertical construction.\n\u25cf\nOf Ash and Steel\n- Third\u2011person, low\u2011fantasy open\u2011world RPG emphasizing methodical melee combat, unguided exploration, and old\u2011school progression without quest markers.\n\u25cf\nStreets of Rogue 2\n- Procedural, systems\u2011heavy open world that supports multiple playstyles-sneak, fight, trade, build, or farm-within a chaotic\nimmersive\n\u2011sim sandbox.\n\u25cf\nSpeedRunners 2\n- Competitive side\u2011scrolling racing/platformer sequel with 8\u2011player lobbies and a new 64\u2011player tournament format for large\u2011scale events.\n\u25cf\nTrainfort\n- Co\u2011op\nsurvival\n\u2011crafting game about dwarven nomads building a mobile train\u2011base to traverse a vast, post\u2011apocalyptic world in search of resources.\n\u25cf\nHozy\n- Cozy renovation sim focused on cleaning, refurbishing, and decorating neglected interiors with straightforward tools and high \"before/after\" payoff.\n\u25cf\nI Am Future\n(console) - Cozy post-apocalyptic survival/crafting on flooded city rooftops; build and decorate a base, farm and fish, tinker with gadgets, and automate chores with helper robots.\n\u25cf\nVOIN\n(version 1.0) - Fast first\u2011person hack\u2011and\u2011slash action\u2011RPG with loot\u2011driven builds and expanding regions like the \"Permafrost\" zone adding progression and late\u2011game challenges.\nInvesting and innovating for growth\nThe\nGroup continuously reviews the allocation of\nresources to maximise the\npotential\nof each game during the development process.\nSince before the IPO, tinyBuild's mantra has been to\nmaintain\na well-diversified portfolio of own-IP that can be scaled into cross-media franchises, and we remain loyal to that.\nStrict discipline on investments goes hand in hand with\nnimble and decentralised structure\n. At a time when most are re-trenching on their catalogue, the Company proved it\nis capable of delivering high-quality\nnew-IP\nand\nminimise the setbacks. The launch of\nThe King is Watching\nis a\ngood example of how\nthe Company's\nsophisticated marketing strategy can attract a large audience even for a brand-new franchise.\nOur\nfocus has been on cash generation and financial stability. The executive team\nis\nmore selective about signing up new titles, while an uncertain macroeconomic environment\ncreates many opportunities. The disposal of Red Cerberus (2 April 2025) refocused the Company on its' core competencies, with more direct investments in high-\npotential studios.\nPeople\nExcluding the disposal of Red Cerberus, the number of staff remained broadly stable in 2025 at\nnearly 200.\nProject and budget ownership means it is even easier to spot and reward talent across the Group, which translates in a high retention rate.\ntinyBuild continues to support all its staff (employees and independent contractors) and their families affected by the war in Ukraine and it continues to carefully monitor the situation. Having helped staff move out of the riskiest areas, the Group remains focused on mental health and administrative support so they can settle in their preferred location across Europe.\nPosition and strategy\ntinyBuild is well-positioned with a strong pipeline of new titles and a proven ability to attract, screen and market high-quality game franchises. Our balanced investment strategy aims at building a diversified portfolio of high-potential own-IP, and our multimedia franchise model allows us to extend the life of our IP, maximising our return on investment.\nOur medium-term strategy is to expand our position as a leading global video games developer and publisher, focussing on IP ownership while creating long-term scalable franchises across multiple media formats.\n2025\nhas seen significant progress towards that ambition, and I would like to thank all of\nour staff for their amazing contribution and\nour shareholders for their support.\nAlex Nichiporchik\nChief Executive Officer\n16\nSeptember 2025\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nResults for the six months ended June 2025 were\nahead of\nexpectations,\nin a market that remains extremely competitive. The\nGroup\ncontinued\nto strengthen its financial position\n, including the disposal of Red Cerberus (QA subsidiary in Brazil), and had\n$4.6m in cash and cash equivalents (no debt\n) at the end of the period.\nRevenue\nIn the six months to June 2025, tinyBuild revenues from continuing operations\n(excluding Red Cerberus)\nwere $17.0m,\nbroadly even\ncompared to the previous period (H1 2024: $16.8m\n).\nBack catalogue performed\nparticularly\nstrongly in the first half,\nwith the successful release of Deadside on console,\nsupported by over\n90\ntitles and by well-established franchises such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, Potion Craft and Streets of Rogue. Revenue from events, primarily DevGAMM,\nincreased slightly\nat $0.\n8m\nas the Group consolidated\nits presence\nin Central and Western Europe.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Operating Profit\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented net of amortisation of development costs, excluding impairment of development costs, share-based compensation expenses, exceptional costs (e.g. legal costs related to M&A) and other operating income, giving a clear yet conservative picture of the business progression. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\nfor H1 2025\nwas positive $4.2\nm\n($2.3m loss in H1 of 2024), reflecting\nstable revenues, a more favourable revenue mix (85% own-IP revenues Vs 78% in H1 2024) and the full benefit of a\nlower\ncost\nbase,\nalong with lower\namortisation of development costs\n($\n3.9m in H1 2025 vs $4.5m in H1 2024).\nOperating profit from continuing operations for H1 2025 was positive $3.6\nm\n(H1 2024: $6.6m loss), after accounting for the $1.1m impairment of development costs (H1 2024: $3.0m). Excluding the impairment charges, a higher EBITDA is derived by lower general and administrative expenses ($7.3m in H1 2025 compared with $10.5m in H1 2024) following the reduction in workforce undertaken in 2024.\nFinance costs and taxation\nAs the Group carries no debt, finance costs were immaterial in H1 2025. Taxation charges were $0.\n3m\n(H1 2024: $0.3m).\nImpairment\nIn H1 2025, tinyBuild incurred $1.1m charges relating to the impairment of development costs ($3.0m in H1 2024).\nCash Flow\nCash flows from operating activities were $6.8m ($2.0m in H1 2024), including a $3.0\nm\ndecrease in net working capital (H1 2024: $1.4m decrease). Software development costs, mainly consisting of developer salaries, advances, localisation and porting, decreased 29% to $6.2m ($8.7m in H1 2024), reflecting the rationalisation in investment for upcoming pipeline releases.\nEmployee incentive plan and EBT update\nThe Employee Benefit Trust continued to hold a total of 3,937,587 ordinary shares as at\n16\nSeptember 2025. The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy potential share awards and future option exercises, once vested.\nAs previously announced, the Remuneration Committee of tinyBuild intends to utilise share awards to incentivise and retain key employees and executive directors and further announcements are expected to be made in the near term. The share awards not only encourage share ownership and stakeholder alignment in the business but also serves to preserve cash resources that would otherwise be used by the Company to satisfy bonus awards.\nFinancial Position\nThe net cash position at the end of June 2025 was $4.6m ($3.1m at the end of December 2024), with the majority of the variation driven by the $1.0m net proceeds from the

CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n1\nGENERAL INFORMATION\ntinyBuild Inc. (\"the Company\") is a public company limited by shares, and is registered, domiciled and incorporated in Delaware, USA. The address of the registered office is 1239 120th Ave NE, Suite A, Bellevue, WA 98005, United States.\nThe Group (\"the Group\") consists of tinyBuild Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. The Group's principal activity is that of an indie video game publisher and developer.\nThe Board of Directors approved this interim financial information on 16 September 2025.\n2\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThese condensed, consolidated financial statements for the interim half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2025 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'. These interim financial statements do not constitute full financial statements and do not include all the notes of the type normally included in annual financial statements. Accordingly, these financial statements are to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nThe annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"). The Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2024 have been issued and are available on the Group's investor relations' website: https://www.tinybuildinvestors.com/documents-and-presentations.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for, where disclosed in the accounting policies, certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value. The financial statements are prepared in US Dollars, which is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Group. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand US Dollars (US$'000).\nTax charged within the\nsix\nmonths ended 30 June 2025 has been calculated by applying the effective rate of tax which is expected to apply to the Group for the year ending 31 December 2025 as required by IAS 34.\nWith the exception of the new standard set out below, the Group has applied the same accounting policies and methods of computation in its interim consolidated financial statements as in its 31 December 2024 annual financial statements.\nStandard/amendment\nEffective date\nAmendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability\n1 January 2025\nThe above standard, that will apply for the first time in the next annual financial statements,\nhas\nnot\nhad\na material impact on the Group.\nGoing concern\nThe Group remains in a significant net asset position of $41.8m at the reporting date. The Group continues to have no borrowings and has cash and cash equivalents of $4.6m at the reporting date. Generating further funds through the sale of intellectual property remains an option for the Group. Furthermore, the Group has a number of high-potential games in the pipeline, which are anticipated to contribute to organic revenue growth in the second half of FY25 and beyond. Having considered the information available and recent changes to the business, the Directors have concluded that there are no material uncertainties related to events or conditions that might cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n3\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nIn April 2025, the Group disposed of Red Cerberus LLC, together with its subsidiary Red Cerberus Brasil LTDA. Accordingly, these subsidiaries have been classified as discontinued operations in the current period. In line with the requirements of IFRS 5, the results of these subsidiaries have been presented within discontinued operations for the current and comparative periods.\nThe results of the discontinued operations, which have been included in the profit for the 6 month period presented, are as follows:\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nRevenue\n329\n2,071\n4,261\nCost of sales\n123\n(1,039)\n(2,698)\nAdministrative expenses\n(465)\n(624)\n(1,834)\nFinance income\n2\n7\n11\nFinance costs\n-\n(20)\n-\n(Loss)/profit before tax from ordinary activities\n(11)\n395\n(260)\nLoss on disposal of subsidiaries\n(482)\n-\n-\n(Loss)/profit before tax from discontinued operations\n(494)\n395\n(260)\nIncome tax\n(72)\n-\n(66)\n(Loss)/profit for the year from discontinued operations\n(565)\n395\n(326)\nThe pre-tax loss on disposal of subsidiaries was determined as follows:\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n$'000\nCash consideration received\n1,296\nCash disposed of\n(308)\nNet cash inflow on disposal of subsidiaries\n988\nNet assets disposed other than cash:\nIntangible assets\n(355)\nProperty, plant and equipment - owned\n(252)\nProperty, plant and equipment - leased\n(229)\nTrade and other receivables\n(1,319)\nTrade and other payables\n438\nLease liabilities\n248\n(1,470)\nPre-tax loss on disposal of subsidiaries\n(482)\nThe cashflows from discontinued operations included in the consolidated cash flow statement for the year 2025 and 2024 are as follows:\nCash flows from / (used in) discontinued operations\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nNet cash inflow from / (used in) operating activities\n227\n658\n1\nNet cash from investing activities (including cash inflows from the sale of subsidiaries)\n-\n(9)\n(15)\nNet cash (used in) / inflow from financing activities\n-\n-\n-\n227\n649\n(14)\n4\nREVENUE\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nAn analysis of the Group's revenue is as follows:\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nRevenue analysed by class of business\nGame and merchandise royalties\n16,129\n16,837\n29,861\nDevelopment services\n100\n(663)\n(805)\nEvents\n752\n590\n1,382\n16,980\n16,764\n30,438\nRevenue from development services is stated net of a true up adjustment of $nil for the period ended 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: $1,092,000, 31 December 2024: $1,092,000).\n5\nSEGMENTAL REPORTING\nIFRS 8 'Operating Segments' requires that operating segments be identified on the basis of internal reporting and decision-making. The Group identifies operating segments based on internal management reporting that is regularly reported to and reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is identified as the chief operating decision maker. Management information is reported as one operating segment, being revenue from self-published franchises and other revenue streams such as royalties, licensing, development and events.\nWhilst the chief operating decision maker assessed there to be only one segment, the Group's portfolio of games is split between those based on IP owned by the Group and those based on IP owned by a third party, therefore to aid the readers' understanding of our results, the split of revenue from these two categories is shown below.\nGame and merchandise royalties\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended 31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nOwned IP\n13,762\n13,070\n23,107\nThird-party IP\n2,367\n3,767\n6,756\n16,129\n16,837\n29,861\nFor the six months ended 30 June 2025, three\ncustomers were responsible for approximately 81% of the Group's revenues (30 June 2024: four - 75%, 31 December 2024: three - 68%).\nThree\ncustomers were responsible for approximately 71%\nof the Group's accounts receivable balance (30 June 202\n4: four - 43%, 31 December 2024: four - 68%).\nAs at 30 June 2025, the\nGroup has one right-of-use asset located overseas with a carrying value of $117,000 (30 June 2024: seven - $516,000, 31 December 2024: five - $374,000).\nAs at 30 June 2025 the\nGroup also has tangible fixed assets located overseas with a total carrying value of $nil (30 June 2024: $397,000, 31 December 2024: $291,552). The reduction is due to the disposal of Red Cerberus LLC, see note 3. All other non-current assets are located in the US.\n6 EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Group reports basic and diluted earnings per common share. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to common shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, which excludes any treasury shares held by the Group.\nDiluted earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, taking into account the effects of all potential dilutive common shares, including options.\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nProfit/(loss) attributable to the owners of the Group\n2,690\n(6,581)\n(20,522)\nWeighted average number of shares\n397,219,319\n369,513,019\n383,484,707\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share ($)\n0.\n007\n(0.018)\n(0.054)\n6 months ended 30 June 2025\n6 months ended 30 June 2024\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nProfit/(\nloss\n)\nattributable to the owners of the Group\n2,690\n(6,581)\n(20,522)\nWeighted average number of shares\n397,219,319\n369,513,019\n383,484,707\nDilutive effect of share options\n-\n-\n-\nDilutive effect of warrants\n-\n-\n-\nWeighted average number of diluted shares\n397,219,319\n369,513,019\n383,484,707\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share ($)\n0.\n007\n(0.018)\n(0.054)\nThere are 2,078,083 options outstanding at period end (30 June 2024: 2,837,095 and 31 December 2024: 2,078,084) and 1,511,449 warrants outstanding at period end (30 June 2024: 1,511,449 and 31 December 2024: 1,511,449). The options and warrants are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the periods ended 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024, and the year ended 31 December 2024 because they are antidilutive.\nPursuant to IAS 33 'Earnings per Share', options whose exercise price is higher than the value of the Group's security were not taken into account in determining the effect of dilutive instruments. The calculation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.\n7\nALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe Directors of the Group have presented the performance measure 'Adjusted EBITDA' as they monitor this performance measure at a consolidated level and they believe this measure is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting profit from continuing operations to exclude the impact of taxation, net finance costs, share-based payment expenses, depreciation, impairment of intangible assets, amortisation of purchased intellectual property, acquisition costs, legal and professional costs associated with the purchase of subsidiaries and intellectual property, Ukraine-related expenses and fair value gains on contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined performance measure in IFRS. The Group's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled performance measures and disclosures by other entities.\nAmortisation of $3.9m (30 June 2024: $4.5m, 31 December 2024: $10.5m) of software development costs has been included in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA, as they are a primary cost in the Group's ordinary course of business.\nAccrued royalties of $1.7m (30 June 2024: $nil, 31 December 2024: $2.3m) have been derecognised as part of a legal settlement. This release of accrued royalties is included as a reduction in royalty expenses within cost of sales. It relates to the second step in the renegotiation of a specific contract and is not expected to recur, therefore it has been deducted in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA.\n6 months ended\n30 June 2025\n6 months ended\n30 June 2024\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nProfit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations\n3,286\n(6,881)\n(20,268)\nIncome tax expense\n309\n323\n267\nFinance costs\n14\n42\n27\nFinance income\n-\n(60)\n(133)\nShare-based payment expenses\n110\n102\n147\nAmortisation of purchased intellectual property, brands and customer relationships\n1,545\n1,758\n3,291\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\n85\n303\n424\nImpairment of development costs and other intangible assets\n1,081\n3,028\n13,663\nRelease of accrued royalties\n(1,700)\n-\n(2,269)\nOther operating income\n(500)\n(137)\n(1,024)\nGain on disposal of intangible assets\n-\n(773)\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\n4,230\n(2,295)\n(5,875)\n8 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nBrands\nCustomer relationships\nPurchased intellectual property\nSoftware development costs\nTotal\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\n$'000\nCost:\nAs at 1 January 2024\n13,202\n1,815\n4,261\n29,966\n97,183\n146,427\nAdditions - internally generated\n-\n-\n-\n-\n19,315\n19,315\nDisposals\n-\n-\n-\n(2,000)\n(1,159)\n(3,159)\nAs at 31 December 2024\n13,202\n1,815\n4,261\n27,966\n115,339\n162,583\nAdditions - internally generated\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6,245\n6,245\nDisposals\n(5,960)\n-\n(4,261)\n-\n-\n(10,221)\nAs at 30 June 2025\n7,242\n1,815\n-\n27,966\n121,584\n158,607\nAmortisation and impairment:\nAs at 1 January 2024\n13,202\n879\n3,786\n13,868\n63,180\n94,915\nAmortisation charge for the year - continuing operations\n-\n73\n-\n3,219\n10,504\n13,796\nAmortisation\ncharge for the period - discontinued operations\n-\n-\n97\n-\n-\n97\nImpairment charge for the year\n-\n-\n-\n-\n13,663\n13,663\nDisposals\n-\n-\n-\n(510)\n(1,128)\n(1,638)\nAs at 31 December 2024\n13,202\n952\n3,883\n16,577\n86,219\n120,833\nAmortisation charge for the period - continuing operations\n-\n36\n-\n1,545\n3,921\n5,502\nAmortisation\ncharge for the period - discontinued operations\n-\n-\n24\n-\n-\n24\nImpairment charge for the period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,081\n1,081\nDisposals\n(5,960)\n-\n(3,907)\n-\n-\n(9,867)\nAs at 30 June 2025\n7,242\n988\n-\n18,122\n91,221\n117,573\nCarrying amount:\nAs at 30 June 2025\n-\n827\n-\n9,844\n30,363\n41,034\nAs at 31 December 2024\n-\n863\n378\n11,389\n29,120\n41,750\nDuring\nH1\n2025, the Group has recorded impairment losses of $1.1m\nagainst the carrying value of software development costs.

Despite this challenging backdrop, tinyBuild is carefully managing its catalogue (e.g. release of Deadside on consoles) while investing in high-potential new IP (e.g. Kingmakers and SAND). tinyBuild's revenue is trading slightly ahead of expectations for the first five months of the year.\nAs at 31 May 2025 and despite certain game delays, the Company had cash levels of mid-single digit millions demonstrating a reduced cash burn in the business and disciplined cash management.\nCash and cash equivalents are anticipated to reach a trough point in the summer of 2025 and are expected to improve post the launch of certain high-potential new games.\nThe Company has no borrowings.\nPipeline\nThe positive momentum is also translating in strong performance in terms of wishlists, one of the most important indicators for future sales:\nKingmakers\nis now in the #13 Most Wishlisted Games on Steam, SAND #41, Streets of Rogue 2 #61 and Ferocious #120.\nThe release schedule remains heavily weighted towards the second half of the year and risk remains around new launches. As a mitigating factor, the Company remains fully focused on cost control and regularly reviews investment in new games to align with audience validation.\nEmployee Benefit Trust (EBT)\nAs at today's date, the EBT holds a total of 3,937,587 ordinary shares. The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy future\u00a0share awards and\u00a0option exercises of vested options granted.\nOutlook\nThe pipeline for 2025 and beyond is strong and includes a number of larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous investment in the catalogue including updates, DLCs and platform launches.\nThe evolving macroeconomic situation and continuation of the conflict in Ukraine impose caution and vigilance in the medium and long term. In particular, tinyBuild carefully assesses the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business.\nAll things considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results in line with expectations.\nAlex Nichiporchik, Chief Executive Officer of tinyBuild, commented:\n\"Our investments to create new great IP are starting to bear fruits. Last week, we held our second tinyBuild Connect to showcase the most promising pipeline we ever had, including the likes of SAND, Kingmakers, DUCKSIDE, Streets of Rogue 2, The King is Watching, Trainfort, All will Fall, Of Ash and Stee, SpeedRunners 2l and more.

EBITDA1\n(3,681)\n(7,113)\nnmf\n1\nExcludes share-based compensation expenses, and exceptional items (e.g. Impairment) includes amortisation of Development costs\nFinancial highlights:\n\u25cf\nRevenue declined 22% to $34.7m (2023: $44.7m), due to lower flow through from titles launched in 2023, the disappointing performance of 2024 launches (e.g. Broken Roads and Level Zero: Extraction), some game delays and a generally weak market.\n\u25cf\nAdj. EBITDA loss improved to $3.7m (2023: $7.1m), as the result of cost actions and a slightly more favourable revenue mix partly offset lower revenues.\n\u25cf\nOperating loss was $20.4m (2023: $63.8m), because of a further $13.7m impairment of development advances (2023: $36.2m), and a $1.8m impairment of trade receivables (2023: $nil). Excluding these one-off charges, the operating loss is $4.9m (2023: $12.3m).\n\u25cf\nLoss before tax was $20.3m (2023: $63.5m) and basic EPS was -5.4c (2023: -30.7c).\n\u25cf\nOperating cash flow decreased to $6.3m (2023: $10.9m), because of revenue decline and broadly neutral net working capital contribution.\n\u25cf\nAs expected, net cash at 31 December 2024 was $3.1m compared to $2.5m at 31 December 2023, reflecting lower revenues and $19.4m investment in development costs (2023: $31.9m)\n.\nOperational highlights:\n\u25cf\nBack catalogue sales represented 87% of total revenue (2023: 92%), including a solid performance of the top franchises.\n\u25cf\nContribution to revenues from own-IP titles increased to 77% of Gaming revenues (2023: 66%), as performance of first- and second-party titles improved.\n\u25cf\nIn H1 2024, tinyBuild sold\nTotal Reliable Delivery Service\nand Surgeon Simulator to Atari.\n\u25cf\nIn 2024, tinyBuild released a number of new titles, including\nLil' Guardsman\n,\nKill it With Fire 2\n,\nBroken Roads\n,\nDUCKSIDE\n,\nLevel Zero: Extraction\n,\nVOIN\nand\nDrill Core\n, plus v1.0 for\nI am Future\nand\nDeadside\n, and DLCs for\nCartel Tycoon\n,\nPunch Club 2\nand\nNot For Broadcast\n.\nEmployee Benefit Trust:\n\u25cf\nDuring the year, the Employee Benefit Trust has purchased an additional 971,636 ordinary shares on the market and held a total of 3,937,587 ordinary shares as of 31 December 2024. The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy potential future option exercises of vested options granted.\nPost Period End highlights:\n\u25cf\nOn 3 April 2025, tinyBuild announced the disposal of Red Cerberus for a total consideration of $1.5m in cash, subject to standard net working capital adjustments, and the proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes.\n\u25cf\nDeadside\n's strong performance following its v1.0 and console launch, will help support\ninvestments in upcoming high-potential game releases scheduled for the second half of this year.\nKingmakers\nis currently #15 in the global Steam wishlists rank,\nSAND\n#40,\nStreets of Rogue 2\n#57 and\nFEROCIOUS\n#135.\n\u25cf\nThe announcement trailer of SpeedRunners 2, tinyBuild's iconic competitive platformer, collected over 20 million views across YouTube in the first three days, making it one of the most successful announcements in the Company's history. The Company also announced new titles such as\nThe King is Watching\n,\nALL WILL FALL\nand\nOf Ash and Steel\n.\nOutlook:\n\u25cf\nAs at 31 March 2024, the Company had cash levels in the low single digit millions.\nCash and cash equivalents are anticipated to reach a trough point in the summer of 2025 and is expected to improve post the launch of certain high-potential new games.\n\u25cf\nThe performance of Deadside and the disposal of Red Cerberus has provided the Company with greater flexibility and the exact release dates for games will be set taking into account competitive launches and, as is standard, risk remains around new launches and the ability to convert wishlists into revenue.\n\u25cf\nThe cash position will be carefully managed as the Company invests in upcoming game releases in a disciplined manner. The Company has no borrowings and it continues to assess its IP portfolio for strategic opportunities.\n\u25cf\nThe pipeline for 2025 and beyond is strong and includes a number of larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous investment in the catalogue including updates, DLCs and platform launches.\n\u25cf\nThe continuation of the conflict in Ukraine",

Cash and cash equivalents are\nanticipated to reach a trough point in the summer of 2025 and improve post the launch of certain high-potential new games. The cash position will\nbe carefully managed\nas the Company invests in upcoming game releases in a disciplined manner. The Company has no borrowings and it continues to assess its IP portfolio for strategic opportunities.\nPipeline\nUpcoming launches are showing strong performance in terms of wishlists, one of the most important indicators for future sales. In particular,\nKingmakers, SAND\nand\nFEROCIOUS\nare now in the top 20, 50 and 140 Most Wishlisted Games on Steam.\nThe exact release dates will be set taking into account competitive launches and, as is standard, risk remains around new launches and the ability to convert wishlists into revenue. As a mitigating factor, the Company remains fully focused on cost control and regularly reviews investment in new games to align with audience validation.\nEmployee Benefit Trust\nAs at today's date, the Employee Benefit Trust holds a total of 3,937,587 ordinary shares with no new purchases in H2 2024. The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy future share awards and option exercises of vested options granted.\nOutlook\nThe pipeline for 202\n5\nis strong and includes a number of larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous investment in the catalogue such as updates, DLCs and platform launches.\nThe implication of the conflict in Ukraine along with the evolving macroeconomic situation impose caution and vigilance in the medium and long term. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and carefully manage cash resources ahead of the release of high-potential new IP in 2025.\nAll considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results in line with expectations.\nAlex Nichiporchik, Chief Executive Officer of tinyBuild, commented:\n\"Over the past two years we rightsized the business to cope with increasingly difficult market conditions and refocused on the 1000-hour game model, while managing cash carefully.

(AIM: TBLD, TBLS), a premium video games publisher and developer with global operations, announces the consolidation of its two lines of Common Stock into a single unrestricted line of Common Stock (TBLD.L). This will be affected by the transfer of all stock comprising the Regulation S restricted Common Stock (TBLS.L) trading line to the unrestricted Common Stock (TBLD.L) trading line.\nThis transfer is taking place in accordance with the provisions outlined in the circular published by the Company on 22 December 2023 that the two lines of Common Stock would be consolidated following expiration of the distribution compliance period in relation to new shares issued by the Company in relation to the Fundraise in December 2023 which admitted on 30 January 2024. Further details on the restrictions and distribution compliance period are set out below. The move will result in the cancellation of trading of the Regulation S restricted trading line TBLS.L (ISIN Number USU8884H1371). Defined terms used in this announcement shall have the same meaning as those used in the circular posted to shareholders on 22 December 2023, which is available on the Company's website at:\nhttps://www.tinybuildinvestors.com/documents-and-presentations\nCurrently tinyBuild common stock of $0.01 par each (\"\nCommon Stock\n\") are held as:\n(i) unrestricted Common Stock trading under the symbol TBLD.L (ISIN number USU8884H1033)\n(ii) restricted Common Stock trading under the symbol TBLS.L (ISIN number USU8884H1371)\nThe number of unrestricted shares of Common Stock currently trading under the symbol 'TBLD.L' is 203,878,238 and the number of restricted shares of Common Stock currently trading under the symbol 'TBLS.L' is 193,341,081.\nFrom 31 January 2025, all tinyBuild Common Stock will be held as unrestricted shares in TBLD, and there will be a total of 397,219,319 shares of Common Stock trading under 'TBLD.L'. Shareholders in the Company may use this figure as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the stock capital of the Company.\nFurther details regarding the restricted shares\nAs stated in the Company's circular dated 22 December 2023, the Company has intended to transfer the restricted shares held by non-affiliates (as defined under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"\nSecurities Act\n\")) of the Company (including those holders who are affiliates only by virtue of their position as an officer or director of the Company) to the unrestricted line of Common Stock. As this includes all of the restricted shares the Company will also be cancelling the restricted trading line.\nWhile the restricted shares on the trading line TBLD.L are identical in all respects to the Company's Common Stock, free from all liens, charges and encumbrances of any kind, during the \"distribution compliance period\" (as set out under Regulation S under the Securities Act), they are subject to the conditions listed under section 903(b)(3), or Category 3, of Regulation S. This restricted line of Common Stock under the symbol TBLS.L is held in the CREST system and has been segregated within CREST identified with the marker \"REG S\" and ISIN USU8884H1371. Those shares may not be offered or sold to, or for the account or benefit of, US Persons (as defined under the Securities Act) during the distribution compliance period.\nThe distribution compliance period will end on 30 January 2025 and the restricted Regulation S trading line with the symbol TBLS.L and ISIN USU8884H1371 will cease trading at 4:30pm (London time) on 30 January 2025. All shareholders on the TBLS.L share register at 6:00pm (London time) on 30 January 2025 will have their shareholding in Common Stock transferred to the non-restricted share register. From 31 January 2025 all tinyBuild Common Stock will trade under the symbol TBLD.L, ISIN number USU8884H1033.

Versus Evil continues to underperform, after the disappointing launch of\nBroken Roads\nin April 2024. Despite this challenging backdrop, tinyBuild is carefully managing its catalogue while investing in high-potential new IP and tinyBuild's revenues have started to trade slightly ahead of expectations for the first five months of the year.\nIn addition to this, the response to recent announcements gives reason for optimism, as backed by hard data:\nLevel Zero: Extraction\nand\nDUCKSIDE\ndemos are respectively in the top 3 and top 10 most played games at the ongoing Steam Next Fest.\nAs at 31 May 2024, the Company had cash levels of mid-to-high single digit demonstrating a reduced cash burn as a result of cost control measures put in place at the end of 2023. In addition to the cash at the end of May 2024, the Company also disposed of IP associated with Surgeon SIM to Atari for an undisclosed sum in June 2024. As previously announced, cash and cash equivalents\nis anticipated to reduce towards the half year as the Company invests in upcoming game releases. The Group continues to have no borrowings.\nPipeline\nThe positive momentum is also translating in strong performance in terms of wishlists, one of the most important indicators for future sales. The Company added 1m new wishlists across the portfolio in the past month.\nKingmakers\nis now in the top 25 Most Wishlisted Games on Steam.\nThe release schedule remains heavily weighted towards the second half of the year and risk remains around new launches. As a mitigating factor, the Company remains fully focused on cost control and regularly reviews investment in new games to align with audience validation.\nEmployee Benefit Trust\nAs at today's date, the\u00a0Employee Benefit Trust\u00a0holds a total of 3,937,587 ordinary shares. The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy future\u00a0share awards and\u00a0option exercises of vested options granted.\nOutlook\nThe pipeline for 2024 and beyond is strong and includes a number of larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous investment in the catalogue including updates, DLCs and platform launches.\nThe implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation impose caution and vigilance in the medium and long term.

Four weeks ago, we held our first ever tinyBuild Connect to showcase the most promising pipeline we ever had, including the likes of SAND, Kingmakers, Level Zero: Extraction, DUCKSIDE, Streets of Rogue 2, Drill Core and more.\"\n\"In a month our games added a combined one million wishlists on Steam and players spent approximately 1.8 million hours in-game with our playtests and demos since March 2024. These are hard numbers showing that our strategy is working. I am excited about 2024 and beyond and I want to thank all the people that make this possible.\"\nEnquiries\n:\ntinyBuild, Inc\nAlex Nichiporchik - Chief Executive Officer and co-founder\nGiasone (Jaz) Salati - Chief Financial Officer\ninvestorrelations@tinybuild.com\nBerenberg (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nMark Whitmore, Ciaran Walsh, Milo Bonser\n+44 (0)20 3207 7800\nSEC Newgate (Financial PR)\nRobin Tozer, Harry Handysid",

Notably, Versus Evil saw over 60% revenue decline in the period as a result of game delays.\n\u00b7\nAdj. EBITDA decreased to negative $7.1m (2022: positive $24.4m), primarily due to lower revenues from large contracts, higher amortisation of development costs and inflationary pressures.\n\u00b7\nOperating loss was $63.8m (2022: $15.9m profit), as a result of $48.1m impairment charges ($36.2m on development advances and $11.9m on intangibles assets), a $3.5m one-off legal settlement alongside lower revenues and higher costs.

The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy future\nshare awards and\noption exercises of vested options granted.\nPost Period End highlights:\n\u00b7\nIn January 2024, tinyBuild raised $12.3m ($11.4\nm\nnet proceeds) from existing and new shareholders in a placing, subscription and open offer.\n\u00b7\nAs at 31 March 2024, post the January fundraise, the Company had cash levels in the high single-digit millions.\nThis is anticipated to reduce towards the half year as the Company invests in upcoming game releases scheduled for the second half of this year. The announcement trailer of Kingmakers collected tens of millions views across all social networks in the first few weeks, making it one of the most successful announcements in the Company's history. The Company also announced new titles Duckside and RBO.\n\u00b7\nAmong other titles already announced, Streets of Rogue 2, Level Zero, VOIN, Ferocious, SAND and Rawmen continue to track in line with expectations.\n\u00b7\nIn February 2024, tinyBuild sold\nTotal Reliable Delivery Service\nto Atari for an undisclosed sum. There has been two studio closures post year end; Moon Moose LLC was closed in February 2024 and Demagic LLC was closed in March 2024.\n\u00b7\nIn March 2024, Michael Schauble, Chief Commercial Officer, resigned from tinyBuild to focus on\nhis\nfamily. Michael's role and responsibilities have been successfully taken over by the existing business development and leadership team.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nThe pipeline for 2024 and beyond is strong and includes a number of larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous inv",

In order to enable these significant Stockholders to vote, the Directors believe the best course of action is to adjourn the Special Meeting later today.\nThe Company therefore announces that its Special Meeting due to be held later today is expected to be adjourned to 26 January 2024 (the \"\nAdjourned Meeting\n\") with further details to be released later today. Valid proxy votes submitted in respect of the Special Meeting will be counted at the Adjourned Meeting.\nThe Company has received more than 99% of the votes cast to date in favour of both the Resolutions and therefore the Board is confident that the Resolutions will be passed at the Adjourned Meeting.\nImportance of the Vote\nThe Company reiterates that if the Resolutions are not passed at the Special Meeting or any Adjourned Meeting, the Fundraise will not take place and the proceeds of the Fundraise will not be received by the Company.\nFailure to conclude the Fundraise\nby the end of January 2024\nwill materially compromise the Group's ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nIn the unlikely event the Resolutions are not passed at the Adjourned Meeting,\nthe CEO has indicated he is willing to support the Company. Failure to secure alternative forms of finance on commercially acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, prospects, capital resources, cash flows, share price, liquidity, results and/or future operations.\nResults of Open Offer\nThe\u00a0Company announces the closing of the Open Offer, and that it has received valid applications, including those received under the\u00a0Excess Application Facility, in respect of a total of 4,844,179 new Shares, totalling \u00a3242,208.95. Qualifying Shareholders who have validly applied for Open\u00a0Offer Shares\u00a0pursuant to their Basic and Excess Shares Entitlement, will receive their application in full assuming the Resolutions are passed at the Special Meeting.\nFurther information on the Fundraise and voting at the Special Meeting can be found on the Company's website at: https://www.tinybuildinvestors.com/documents-and-presentations.\nStockholders should direct any questions on how to submit their votes to their financial adviser, broker or to the Company's registrar Link Group on (+44) 0371 664 0391 or via email at shareholderenquiries@linkgroup.co.uk.\nCapitalised terms used, but not otherwise defined in this announcement are as defined in the Circular published on 22 December 2023.\nFor further information please contact:\ntinyBuild, Inc\ninvestorrelations@tinybuild.com\nAlex Nichiporchik - Chief Executive Officer\nGiasone (Jaz) Salati - Chief Financial Officer\nMichael Schauble - Chief Commercial Officer\nBerenberg (Nominated Adviser and Sole Broker)\nMark Whitmore, Ciaran Walsh, Milo Bonser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3207 7800\nSEC Newgate (Financial PR)\ntinybuild@secnewgate.co.uk\nRobin Tozer, Harry Handyside, Molly Gretton\n+44 (0)7540 106366\nAbout tinyBuild:\nFounded in 2013, tinyBuild (AIM: TBLD) is a global video games publisher and developer, with a catalogue of more than 80 premium titles across different genres. tinyBuild's strategy is to focus on its own intellectual property (IP) to build multi-game and multimedia franchises, in partnership with developers.\ntinyBuild is headquartered in the USA with operations stretching across the Americas and Europe.

In particular, failure to conclude the Fundraise will materially compromise the Group's ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due and, in the opinion of the Board, likely result in the Group entering into a chapter 11 bankruptcy or some other form of insolvency procedure without alternative funding under which the prospects for recovery of value, if any, by stockholders would be uncertain.\nAs set out in more detail in the circular sent to Stockholders on 22 December 2023, if the Company does not receive the proceeds of the Fundraise, the Company would have to seek other forms of emergency financing. Whilst the CEO has indicated he is willing to support the Company, no terms have been agreed beyond the proposed Subscription and the Company is unable to provide any assurance that alternative financing could be secured. Failure to secure alternative forms of finance at all or on commercially acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, prospects, capital resources, cash flows, share price, liquidity, results and/or future operations.\nFurther information on the fundraise and the general meetings can be found on the company's website at: https://www.tinybuildinvestors.com/documents-and-presentations\nStockholders should direct any questions on how to submit their votes to their financial adviser, broker or to the Company's registrar Link Group on (+44) 0371 664 0391 or via email at shareholderenquiries@linkgroup.co.uk.\nUpdate on holding in Company\nThe Company was notified by Swedbank on 11 January 2024 that Swedbank reduced its respective holding in the Company to below 5% on 11th October 2023 and below 3% on 13th October 2023.\nCapitalised terms used, but not otherwise defined in this announcement\nare as defined in the circular published on 22 December 2023.\nFor further information please contact:\ntinyBuild, Inc\ninvestorrelations@tinybuild.com\nAlex Nichiporchik - Chief Executive Officer\nGiasone (Jaz) Salati - Chief Financial Officer\nMichael Schauble - Chief Commercial Officer\nBerenberg (Nominated Adviser and Sole Broker)\nMark Whitmore, Ciaran Walsh, Milo Bonser\nTel: +44 (0) 20 3207 7800\nSEC Newgate (Financial PR)\ntinybuild@secnewgate.co.uk\nRobin Tozer, Harry Handyside, Molly Gretton\n+44 (0)7540 106366\nAbout tinyBuild:\nFounded in 2013, tinyBuild (AIM: TBLD) is a global video games publisher and developer, with a catalogue of more than 80 premium titles across different genres. tinyBuild's strategy is to focus on its own intellectual property (IP) to build multi-game and multimedia franchises, in partnership with developers.\ntinyBuild is headquartered in the USA with operations stretching across the Americas and Europe.

CEO and founder Alex Nichiporchik confirming support for the Company and willingness to underwrite, subject to shareholder approval, a future equity fundraise of up to $10 million\n?\nCompany intends to offer shareholders and other investors the opportunity to participate in any such potential equity fundraise and will provide a further announcement as and when appropriate\nCurrent Trading and Cost Action\nSince the publication of the Company's interim results in September 2023 (\"\n2023 Half Year Results\")\n, the market has deteriorated further and negotiations of certain large contracts have extended into the final month of the year. These remain under negotiation and may not be signed by year end, or at all. The continued underperformance of Versus Evil which delayed into 2024 three out of four games originally planned for release in H2 2023, including the widely anticipated Broken Roads, also weighed on group performance. As a result, FY23 revenues are now likely to be between $40-50 million1 with the top end of this range dependent on the aforementioned large contracts being signed and anticipated December trading before the year end.\nThe mix of revenues remains tilted towards lower-margin third-party games, which has a negative impact on gross profit margin, when compared to FY22. In an effort to mitigate the impact of lower expected cash inflows just before the end of the year, the Company has promptly accelerated its cost reduction plan. Further reduction of studio cash burn, the refocus on lower risk and higher than expected return projects and the optimisation of the publishing units are expected to contribute to a cash outflow reduction by $5-10 million per annum, starting from FY24. One-off severance charges and further impairments may be booked in FY 2023 as a result of further cost action.\nSettlement Terms\nOn 4 December 2023, tinyBuild agreed to a binding summary of terms relating to a global settlement agreement (the \"Settlement Terms\") to be entered into with\nSteve Escalante, Lance James and Stall Proof, LLC\n(the \"Claimants\") relating to the following claims which have been made against tinyBuild following its acquisition of Versus Evil LLC (\"Versus Evil\") and Red Cerberus LLC (\"Red Cerberus\") in November 2021 (together, the \"Claims\"):\n(a) MIPA Claim\nAs previously disclosed in tinyBuild's 2023 Half Year Results,\nin November 2021,\ntinyBuild acquired Versus Evil and Red Cerberus from the Claimants. The Claimants allege that tinyBuild breached three material obligations under the relevant Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the \"MIPA\"). First, the Claimants allege that tinyBuild was obligated and failed to make timely capital contributions to Versus Evil during fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Second, the Claimants allege that tinyBuild was obligated and failed to release to the Claimants certain funds that were held back under the terms of the MIPA. Third, the Claimants allege that tinyBuild was obligated and failed to provide material support to Versus Evil that was promised under the MIPA\n(together, the \"MIPA Claim\").\n(b) Escalante Claim\nIn connection with the aforemen",

Operating Loss2 of $4.7m (H1 2022: $6.8m), reflecting higher G&A costs\n\u00b7\nCash Flow from operating activities dropped to $6.6m (H1 2022: $8.8m), reflecting lower cash profit partly offset by positive net working capital contribution\n\u00b7\nOne-off impairment of development costs ($18.3m) and of intangible assets ($8.9m) reflecting the cancellation of some titles and lower revenue prospects for other titles\n\u00b7\nNet cash position of $14.3m (Dec 2022: $26.5m), after $16.9m investment in game development costs (H1 2022: $14.2m). Cash position at the end of\u00a0December 2023\u00a0expected to be between\u00a0$10-20m, as previously announced\n1\nIncludes amortisation of Development costs. Excludes one-off impairment of Development costs ($18.3m), goodwill ($6.1m) and other intangibles ($2.8m), and share-based compensation expenses (see note 6).\n2\nIncludes amortisation of Development costs. Excludes one-off impairment of Development costs ($18.3m), goodwill ($6.1m) and other intangibles ($2.8m).\nOperational highlights:\n\u00b7\nRelease of new titles such as\nRhythm Sprout\n,\nFarworld Pioneers\nand\nThe Bookwalker\n, plus expansion of catalogue with the launch of VR titles for\nKill It With Fire\n,\nNot For Broadcast\nand\nHello Neighbor: Search and Rescue\n, alongside platform launches.\n\u00b7\nContribution from own-IP decreased to 65% of group revenue (H1 2022: 83%), due to stronger performance of third-party titles, both from back catalogue and new releases.\n\u00b7\nStrong back catalogue sales representing 93% of total revenues (H1 2022: 99%), demonstrating the Company's ability to extend games' life cycles and support investments in new titles.\n\u00b7\nAcquisition of NotGames, a UK-based studio, for an upfront cash consideration of $1.5m plus max contingent consideration of $4.2m, subject to stretched financial targets. NotGames is the developer studio of Not For Broadcast, a critically acclaimed full motion propaganda simulator.\nDirectorate change:\n\u00b7\nOn 29 March Luke Burtis, Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Board Member, resigned from his board position and management role to spend more time with his family. As the Company continues to move towards the more decentralised structure set out at the Capital Markets Day in June 2022, the responsibilities of the COO role have been distributed among a wider group of decision-makers, giving individuals and teams more autonomy and accountability for their areas of responsibility.\n\u00b7\nOn 29 June Tony Assenza, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Board Member, resigned from the Company and the Board. On the same date, tinyBuild announced that Giasone (Jaz) Salati was appointed CFO and Michael Schauble Chief Commercial Officer. Jaz joined the Board of Directors on 3 August 2023.\nEmployee Benefit Trust:\n\u25cf\nThe Employee Benefit Trust continued to purchase ordinary shares on the market and now holds a total of 1,520,864 ordinary shares as at 25 September 2023. The EBT was set up in 2022 for the benefit of current and future employees and will continue to act independently of the Company to satisfy potential future option exercises of vested options granted. The maximum amount of the loan made available to the EBT at any time will be capped at $10m.\nPost-Period End highlights:\n\u25cf\nReleased new titles\nPunch Club 2: Fast Forward\nand\nI Am Future\n, plus platform launches for\nHello Engineer\n,\nBlack Skylands\nand\nPotion Craft.\n\u25cf\nNew episodes of the\nHello Neighbor\nanimated series are planned to release in the second half of the year, in conjunction with important console updates to Hello Neighbor 2, which continues to enjoy an improvement in the review score on PC.\nOutlook\n\u25cf\nThe combination of a weak macroeconomic environment, geopolitical instability and shifts in the industry dynamics, dampens the Company's growth potential in the near-term.\n\u25cf\nThe pipeline for coming months includes a number of new titles (e.g. Critter Cove, Kill It With Fire 2) and further expansion of the catalogue (e.g. Cartel Tycoon launch on consoles), but headwinds observed in the first half of the year will likely continue to weigh on profitability.\n\u25cf\nManagement is hard at work on two main fronts: 1) to accelerate the operational transition to the 1000-hour game model, and 2) to provide greater visibility on financial progress of each project on a continuous basis\n\u25cf\nIn this context, the Board remains confident the Company has adopte",

EBITDA in 2023 and 2024.\n\u25cf Strong reception to new game announcements supports the Company's refocus on building new large own-IP and the move away from third party publishing and services.\n\u25cf Cash position at the end of December 2023 expected to be between $10-20m, below the previous expectations of at least $26.5m.\n\u25cf Re-evaluation of the future potential of some underperforming back-catalogue titles may translate in asset impairments and targeted studio reorganisation.\n\u25cf Tony Assenza, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has resigned for personal reasons. Giasone (Jaz) Salati to be appointed Chief Financial Officer and Michael Schauble to be appointed Chief Commercial Officer with immediate effect.\nCurrent trading\nAs witnessed across the industry, distribution platforms have been significantly downsizing the amount of investments in non-AAA games. Platform deals have been an important driver of tinyBuild's growth and profitability over the past few years, and the Board expects this downward trend to materially impact revenues.\nIn addition, Versus Evil and Red Cerberus (both acquired in November 2021) continued to underperform in H1 2023. Strategic options are under consideration to best deliver the value of the businesses as the Company focuses on its core strategy of developing long lasting franchises internally.\nPartly offsetting these headwinds, catalogue titles continue to perform well, with franchise expansion (i.e. sequels), v1.0 launches and the addition of new platforms, including VR. Furthermore, the strong reception to recent new game announcements supports tinyBuild's decision to invest in new larger-budget own-IP with high replayability. The Game as a Service nature of some of these titles means the revenue contribution tends to be more evenly distributed over a longer period of time while development costs are concentrated in the early years.\nThe reduction of adjusted EBITDA in 2023 and 2024 will be more substantial, due to a significant increase in development cost amortisation and a slightly higher percentage of revenues paid out to developers as royalties adding to the flow through from lower platform deals. As a combination of the above, cash at the end of December 2023 is expected to be between $10-20m, below the previous expectations of at least $26.5m.\nIn the current macro environment, the Company is also reviewing a number of titles, both under development and already launched, to assess the revenue potential. The reorganisation of some studios and impairment of certain assets may follow to achieve the optimal cost base.\nAs in 2022, the release schedule for the current year is weighted towards the second half of the year and the Company will continue to evaluate the progress of titles currently under development and select the best release window to maximise the lifetime value of each IP. The Board expects to complete the transition workstreams, including the impairment, reorganisation and the ongoing assessment of games, by no later than the Company's FY23 results in March 2024.\nPortfolio and pipeline\nIn the first half of 2022, tinyBuild released\nRhythm Sprout\n(PC and Consoles),\nFarworld Pioneers\n(PC and Consoles), and\nThe Bookwalker\n(PC and Consoles). The Company is also investing in new technologies having successfully launched new VR titles in the first half, including\nHello Neighbor: Search and Rescue\n, and\nKill it with Fire VR\n.\nBack catalogue titles continue to perform well including platform launches in the first half (e.g.\nNot For Broadcas\nt, Despot's\nGame\n) and new monetisable events planned in the second half for\nPotion Craft\n,\nHello Engineer\n,\nBlack Skyland\nand\nCartel Tycoon.\nPunch Club 2\n, the anticipated sequel to one of tinyBuild's classic games, is also scheduled to release in the second half, adding to new titles like\nI am Future\n, a cosy survival game in a flooded post-apocalyptic city.\nt\ninyBuild also recently announced a record number of new titles for future release, including\nCritter Cove\n,\nSlime 3K\n,\nKill it with Fire 2\n,\nFEROCIOUS\n,\nLevel Zero and Sand\n, adding to the previously announced\nBroken Roads\n,\nRAWMEN\n,\nStray Souls\nand\nPigeon Simulator\n.\nBoard Changes and People\nAfter a short period of leave for personal reasons, Tony Assenza, CFO, has resigned from the Company and the Board with immediate effect. Following a Board process, tinyBuild announces that Giasone (Jaz) Salati has been appointed CFO with ",

The Company will post the notice of AGM shortly, together with printed copies of the Annual Report to shareholders who requested hard copies.\nThe purpose of the Annual General Meeting is to consider and, if thought fit, pass the following Resolutions, of which Resolutions 1 to 4 will be proposed as Ordinary Resolutions and Resolutions 5 and 6 will be proposed as Special Resolutions:\nResolution 1 - Adoption of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 (\"Annual Report\")\nThe Annual Report of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2022 was sent to stockholders at the same time as this notice of AGM, and is available on the Company's website:\nwww.tinybuildinvestors.com/documents-and-presentations\nResolution 2 - The re-appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as auditor to the Company and authority for the Board to set the auditors' remuneration on an advisory basis\nThe Company is required to appoint auditors at each AGM at which the accounts are laid before the Company, to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. Grant Thornton LLP was appointed by the Board as independent registered public accounting firm of the Company. The Audit Committee of the Board (the \"\nAudit Committee\n\") has reviewed the independence, effectiveness and objectivity of Grant Thornton LLP, on behalf of the Board, who now propose their re-appointment as auditors of the Company. This Resolution 2 also authorises the Board, in accordance with standard practice, to negotiate and agree the remuneration of the auditors.\nAlthough stockholder approval of this appointment is not required by law and is not binding on the Company, if our stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the Audit Committee will consider the failure to ratify the appointment when appointing an independent registered public accounting firm for the following year. Even if our stockholders ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the Audit Committee may, in its sole discretion, terminate such engagement and direct the appointment of another independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year, although it has no current intention to do so.\nResolutions 3-4 - Re-election of Class III Directors\nThe Second Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company state that at the annual meeting, directors shall be elected as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, (the \"\nCertificate\n\"). The Certificate requires that the Board shall be classified, with respect to the term for which they severally hold office, into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of authorized Board. The initial Class II Directors served for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 2022 at which time they were re-elected, the initial Class III Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2023 and the initial Class I Directors shall serve for a term expiring at the annual general meeting to be held in 2024. The Board recommend to the stockholders that these directors are elected.\nThe following directors are Class III Directors, who shall stand for re-election at the AGM:\n-\nAlex Nichiporchik; and\n-\nNick van Dyk.\nBiographical details of all the directors standing for re-election as at the date of this notice are set out in the appendix to the notice of AGM and appear on the corporate information section of the Company's website.\nResolution 5 - Authority to allot Common Stock for the purpose of Capital Investment and disapplication of pre-emption rights\nThe Board is seeking shareholder authorisation to execute non-pre-emptive issues of equity securities to allow the Company to finance expansion opportunities as and when they arise in connection with acquisitions or other capital investments of a kind contemplated by the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles, as updated in November 2022 (each, a \"\nCapital Investment\n\").\nThis Resolution 5 grants the Board authority, in accordance with Article IV, Paragraph 3 of the Certificate, to non-pre-emptively issue New Securities (as such term is defined in the Certificate) up to a maximum of 67,279,818 shares of Common Stock (equal to 33% of the Company's issue",

EBITDA margin\n42.6%\n38.5%\n1\nExcludes share-based compensation expenses, and exceptional items (e.g. IPO cost, Ukraine/ Russia relocation) includes amortisation of Development costs\nFinancial highlights:\n\u25cf\nRevenue grew 21% to $63.3m (2021: $52.2m), reflecting a solid performance in the last part of the year from new titles including Hello Neighbor 2, Tinykin, Asterigos, Spiderheck and back catalogue sales.\n\u25cf\nAdj. EBITDA increased to $24.4m (2021: $22.2m) up 10% y-o-y, while margin decreased to 38.5% (2021: 42.6%) primarily due to the consolidation of Versus Evil and Red Cerberus acquired in November 2021.\n\u25cf\nOperating profit increased by 27% to $15.9m (2021: $12.5m), thanks to lower share-based payment expenses and exceptional costs. It includes a $11.1m write-off of the intangibles from the Versus Evil/ Red Cerberus acquisition broadly offset by a reduction in deferred earn out payment.\n\u25cf\nProfit before tax grew by 27% to $15.9m and basic EPS grew by 32% to 5.7c, reflecting a lower tax charge.\n\u25cf\nOperating cash flow increased 45% to $19.3m (2021: $13.3m), as a result of revenue growth and lower exceptional charges. Excluding $2m one-off items in 2022 (2021: $5.5m), operating cash flow increased by 13% to $21.3m (2021: $18.8m).\n\u25cf\nNet cash as of 31 December 2022 was $26.5m compared to $48.8m as at 31 December 2021, reflecting increased investments on development costs ($35.8m in 2022, vs $15.1m in 2021) and $4.2m cash payment for M&A in the year.\nOperational highlights:\n\u25cf\nIn 2022, tinyBuild released a number of new titles, including Tinykin, SpiderHeck, Asterigos and Hello Neighbor 2, plus version 1.0 of Cartel Tycoon, Despot's Game and Potion Craft, and a number of platform launches which generated growth across the entire portfolio of over 80 titles.\n\u25cf\nNotably, in 2022 the Company launched three new games with a development budget of over $1m that achieved an average return of 1.9x before the end of the year demonstrating the Company's ability to successfully bring larger-budget games to market across multiple platforms and providing a solid base for future releases.\n\u25cf\nContribution to revenues from first/second-party games decreased marginally to 77% of Gaming revenues (2021: 81%), primarily due to the consolidation of Versus Evil's 3rd party portfolio.\n\u25cf\nRobust back catalogue sales represented 80% of total revenue (2021: 83%), demonstrating the Company's ability to extend the life cycle of games, while adding new titles.\n\u25cf\nThree acquihires completed (Demagic, Scythe and Konfa Games) plus the acquisition of Bossa's IP (Surgeon Simulation franchise, I am Bread, I am Fish) for a total upfront cash consideration of $4.2m.\n\u25cf\nSuccessfully relocated over a hundred people following the invasion of Ukraine, and set up a new studio in Belgrade, Serbia.\n\u25cf\nExpanded the size of the revolving credit facility with Bank of America from $25m to $35m and extended the maturity date to three years to maintain the flexibility to fund potential M&A in the most effective way. The facility is currently undrawn.\nDirectorate change:\n\u25cf\nAfter taking paternity leave in 2022, Luke Burtis, Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Board Member, has decided to resign from his board position and management role with immediate effect to spend more time with his family. Luke has been a valuable member of tinyBuild, and his contributions to strategy and operations in the early years have been invaluable. The Board of tinyBuild would like to express its gratitude to Luke for his contributions during his tenure and wishes him all the best in his future endeavours.\n\u25cf\nAs the Company continues to move towards the more decentralised structure set out at the Capital Markets Day in June 2022, the responsibilities of the COO role have been distributed among a wider group of decision-makers, giving individuals and teams more autonomy and accountability for their areas of responsibility. Therefore, the Company does not currently intend to appoint a replacement.\nEmployee Benefit Trust:\n\u25cf\nSince the Company's pre-close trading update released on 23 January 2023, the Employee Benefit Trust has purchased an additional 419,200 ordinary shares on the market and now holds a total of 573,500 ordinary shares.

The Company expects to publish FY 2022 results on 29 March 2023.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nRevenue in line with expectations, with adjusted EBITDA broadly in line\n\u00b7\nEight new titles released in H2 2022, plus Hello Neighbor animated series debut\n\u00b7\nPotion Craft passed 1,000,000 downloads, ahead of PS and Switch launch\nFollowing a solid second half of trading, the Company is on track to deliver another year of strong growth with revenues in line with expectations for FY 2022. Progress in its strategy focused on own-IP also means the Company is on track to deliver Adjusted EBITDA broadly in line with expectations for FY 2022, reflecting a greater investment in marketing to accelerate revenue growth. The cash position at the end of FY 2022 was over $25m, also impacted by timing of M&A and higher development spending on new titles, both announced and unannounced.\nCurrent trading\nOverall, FY 2022 was a challenging year which started with the invasion of Ukraine and was marked throughout by the cost of living crisis, with expectations that video games sales and operations in Eastern Europe may be negatively impacted. Conversely, tinyBuild performed strongly in the second half of 2022, both in terms of sales and game development.\ntinyBuild has continued to diversify its games portfolio into new genres (e.g. simulation, action, strategy), and its revenue sources to benefit from platform competition and the growth in subscription services. This trend gives the Company greater visibility regarding its future revenue growth while helping de-risk ongoing investments.\nPortfolio and pipeline\nIn the second half of 2022, tinyBuild released a number of new titles, including Tinykin, SpiderHeck, Asterigos and Hello Neighbor 2, plus version 1.0 of Cartel Tycoon, Despot's Game and Potion Craft, and a number of platform launches which generated growth across the entire portfolio.\nRecent announcements include the release date for Rhythm Sprouts across PC and consoles and Hello Neighbor: Search and Rescue, a brand new VR title in the Hello Neighbor franchise that will launch both on PSVR2 (Sony) and on Oculus (Meta).\nPeople\nThe number of staff has increased from 147 in March 2021, at the time of the IPO, to over 500 currently.tinyBuild helped staff and their families relocate to safer areas in Eastern Europe and it is carefully monitoring the geopolitical situation adapting its contingency plans to the evolving circumstances. This response to protect staff has resulted in one-off costs during the year, of which up to $2m are expected to be classified as exceptional in the full year results.\ntinyBuild aims to offer employees the best working conditions in the industry. For example, the Company has implemented clear policies against crunching, the industry practice by which developers overwork to meet certain targets. In December 2022, tinyBuild also gave all direct employees an extra week of holiday, following a similar move in June 2022 and FY 2021. As a result, tinyBuild has one of the lowest levels of staff turnover, low single-digit, compared to an estimated 15.5.% at an industry level (Wired).\nEmployee Benefit Trust\nAs set out in the Company's FY 2022 interim results, tinyBuild established an independent employee benefit trust, known as the tinyBuild Share Incentive Trust (the \"EBT\"). The EBT has purchased 154,300 of the Company's common shares of $0.001 in order, to among other things, satisfy potential future option exercises of vested options granted pursuant to the Company's share incentive arrangements and to satisfy the settlement of any other awards granted pursuant to the Company's current and future incentive award schemes.\nOutlook\nEarly indicators of positive consumer traction across the Company's diversified portfolio and pipeline are very encouraging, and the Board looks ahead to FY 2023 with confidence.\nAlex Nichiporchik, Chief Executive Officer of tinyBuild, commented:\n\"\n2022 validated our strategy of investing in long-term, sustainable franchises and the people behind them. We faced unprecedented challenges, all while integrating acquisitions and moving to a decentralised approach that empowers people to make the right decisions.\"\n\"Our focus and shared love for video games resulted in a record Q4 sales period, with a highly diversified portfolio of games across all platforms and early signs of success of our cross-media strategy. We are building something to outlive us as a generation\n.\"\nEnquiries\n:\ntinyBuild, Inc\nAlex Nichiporchik - Chief Executive Officer\nAntonio Jose Assenza - Chief Financial Officer\nGiasone (Jaz) Salati - Head of M&A and IR\ninvestorrelations@tin",

In effecting purchases, as a best practice measure and by analogy with the treatment of buybacks under the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 596/2014), the EBT intends to comply with customary daily price and volume parameters deemed appropriate for the level of liquidity in the Company's shares.\nOutlook\n\u25cf\nThe f\nirst episode of\nHello Neighbor\nanimated series\nwill premiere alongside the release of\nHello Neighbor 2\nin December\n2022\n.\n\u25cf\nThe pipeline for coming months includes version 1.0 release\nof\nHello Neighbor 2\n, Despot's Game and\nPotion Craft\n, and new launches such as\nEville\n(Xbox and PC) and\nAsterigos\n(PS, Xbox and Steam).\n\u25cf\nWhile tinyBuild monitors the impact of the cost of living crisis and of the conflict in Ukraine, early indicators of traction across the pipeline\nof over 30 titles\n, including Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for\nHello Neighbor 2\n, are very encouraging.\n\u25cf\nThe Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations, plus accretive acquisitions.\nAlex Nichiporchik, Chief Executive Officer of tinyBuild, commented:\n\"If\nH\n1 2022 was a game, we would have been play\ning\nit on\nthe \"Very Difficult\" setting.

One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn.

I may as well hold, and pray for a miracle. At least if people stump up the new issue, the cash will help the company, although I suspect the CEO will be left taking up a lot of the shares. If the company fails, at least I will be able to offset the whole 'loss' against capital gains tax liabilities elsewhere!",

          "content": "Having done my research, these are my final comments about this company, no doubt to the delight of MoneyShark!!! The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

A thought I had was that this was actually a clever play by tinyBuild. Kingmakers is now number 6 on Wishlist charts. Number 3 and number 5  (Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders) will have been released by the end of October. This puts Kingmakers into #4.  Quite a coveted position for a microcap!. I am sure many of the sellers were just previously following momentum and were just realising their gains. There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

Cash on a par with mcap alone a clear signal it had reached a silly low. The company had a lot of critics on here, some of whom understandably a bit cross they bought in too early but personally it's been very good to me. I've exited on basis now it's more than bagged from the low so momentum has to fade at somepoint, but will keep a watch. Still believe it looks primed for M&A, whether MBO or by larger firm like Keyword Studios. With industry in a downturn cycle consolidation logical next step.",

The CEO clearly lacks business acumen and we are no where clearer as to whether the former founder member has sold out of the company. In my view it's a complete mess but there's no point selling now. My shares a re virtually worthless and down over 90%. It would be fair to say that I'm a little peeved to say the least.",

Well, now you have the answer. Am I surprised at the news today? No I'm not, because I saw this coming. The people running this company may know their way around a computer game, but they seem to have virtually zero business acumen. The 'Escalante' legal case adds insult to injury with millions having to be paid out. And the 'revolving credit facility' no longer exists because I'm sure the bank terminated it because of either broken covenants or they anticipated it was going to be difficult to recover any funds drawn down. And quite frankly, how long is an extra $10m fund raise going to last at this rate of cash burn? My investment isn't worth selling.  Being down 97% it's virtually worthless. At the present rate, my view is that this company is going bust by this time next year.",

They finally got their reward last month when it joined Aim and its founders became millionaires many times over. Alex Nichiporchik, chief executive, is now worth \u00a3204m as he owns 38.2pc of a company valued at \u00a3534m. His colleague Luke Burtis owns 7.1pc, worth \u00a338m. Their retention of such large stakes is hugely reassuring to this column, whose belief in \u201cfollowing the money\u201d extends to the actions of company bosses as well as those of outside investors. But at least one fund manager has put his clients\u2019 money behind tinyBuild too. \u201cWe like the computer games sector: it is bigger than film and music combined,\u201d said Jon Hudson of Premier Miton Investors, one of the largest institutional backers of tinyBuild. Questor likes the sector too: we have scored big gains with the likes of Frontier Developments, Codemasters and Team17. And tinyBuild takes Team17\u2019s approach: rather than developing its own games it takes on promising titles from independent developers and helps them with funding, marketing and technical expertise. \u201cAlex and Luke discovered the value of this model by direct personal experience: they wanted to release a game called No Time To Explain but were strung along by a publisher, jeopardising the entire project,\u201d said Mr Hudson. \u201cThey realised they could help other developers to commercialise their games so they changed course to become a publisher.\u201d Sign up to our Business Briefing newsletter for a snapshot of the day's biggest business stories Read Questor\u2019s rules of investment before you follow our tips The company says that since August 2013 it has formed partnerships with dozens of independent developers, acting as a publishing partner and \u201cproviding funding, knowledge, production, artwork, guidance, etc to make other developers\u2019 games better\u201d. \u201cThey come at it from a developer\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Mr Hudson. He said tinyBuild selected just 1pc of the games it saw, picking those with the most promise and advising the developers on how to make their game more appealing to users. \u201cIt\u2019s a partnership that works,\u201d he said, \u201cand this way you don\u2019t have to commit much capital \u2013 it\u2019s a low-risk way to generate a big hit.\u201d The ultimate goal is a game that can develop into a \u201cfranchise\u201d: one that can remain popular through multiple versions, with spin-offs, books, prequels and so on.",

A valuation of \u00a3534m to a figure of \u00a36m in two years beggars belief.  Obviously the CEO and other founder have lost a fortune, but the CEO clearly still has more than sufficient funds to totally underwrite the proposed $10m raise. The financial mismanagement is staggering; almost criminal. For those looking for a gamble and an entry point, I suppose this may be it.

To all intents this seems to be virtually the same as a rights issue, but without even the benefit of being able to sell on the nil paid rights, which, given the value of the shares, would be basically worthless anyway. One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn. The whole thing would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.",

          "content": "Having done my research, these are my final comments about this company, no doubt to the delight of MoneyShark!!! The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

The post IPO performance of TBLD's share price may have come as a bit of a shock, esp to Alex who owns such a significant chunk of the company, but it seems they may have learned and adjusted.

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

The company had a lot of critics on here, some of whom understandably a bit cross they bought in too early but personally it's been very good to me. I've exited on basis now it's more than bagged from the low so momentum has to fade at somepoint, but will keep a watch.

Well, now you have the answer. Am I surprised at the news today? No I'm not, because I saw this coming. The people running this company may know their way around a computer game, but they seem to have virtually zero business acumen. The 'Escalante' legal case adds insult to injury with millions having to be paid out. And the 'revolving credit facility' no longer exists because I'm sure the bank terminated it because of either broken covenants or they anticipated it was going to be difficult to recover any funds drawn down. And quite frankly, how long is an extra $10m fund raise going to last at this rate of cash burn? My investment isn't worth selling.  Being down 97% it's virtually worthless. At the present rate, my view is that this company is going bust by this time next year.",

They finally got their reward last month when it joined Aim and its founders became millionaires many times over. Alex Nichiporchik, chief executive, is now worth \u00a3204m as he owns 38.2pc of a company valued at \u00a3534m. His colleague Luke Burtis owns 7.1pc, worth \u00a338m. Their retention of such large stakes is hugely reassuring to this column, whose belief in \u201cfollowing the money\u201d extends to the actions of company bosses as well as those of outside investors. But at least one fund manager has put his clients\u2019 money behind tinyBuild too. \u201cWe like the computer games sector: it is bigger than film and music combined,\u201d said Jon Hudson of Premier Miton Investors, one of the largest institutional backers of tinyBuild. Questor likes the sector too: we have scored big gains with the likes of Frontier Developments, Codemasters and Team17. And tinyBuild takes Team17\u2019s approach: rather than developing its own games it takes on promising titles from independent developers and helps them with funding, marketing and technical expertise. \u201cAlex and Luke discovered the value of this model by direct personal experience: they wanted to release a game called No Time To Explain but were strung along by a publisher, jeopardising the entire project,\u201d said Mr Hudson. \u201cThey realised they could help other developers to commercialise their games so they changed course to become a publisher.\u201d Sign up to our Business Briefing newsletter for a snapshot of the day's biggest business stories Read Questor\u2019s rules of investment before you follow our tips The company says that since August 2013 it has formed partnerships with dozens of independent developers, acting as a publishing partner and \u201cproviding funding, knowledge, production, artwork, guidance, etc to make other developers\u2019 games better\u201d. \u201cThey come at it from a developer\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Mr Hudson. He said tinyBuild selected just 1pc of the games it saw, picking those with the most promise and advising the developers on how to make their game more appealing to users. \u201cIt\u2019s a partnership that works,\u201d he said, \u201cand this way you don\u2019t have to commit much capital \u2013 it\u2019s a low-risk way to generate a big hit.\u201d The ultimate goal is a game that can develop into a \u201cfranchise\u201d: one that can remain popular through multiple versions, with spin-offs, books, prequels and so on.",

There's a 1000-1 chance you will miss out on a huge rise, but there's infinitely more chance of you losing a significant chunk of your original investment. A valuation of \u00a3534m to a figure of \u00a36m in two years beggars belief.  Obviously the CEO and other founder have lost a fortune, but the CEO clearly still has more than sufficient funds to totally underwrite the proposed $10m raise. The financial mismanagement is staggering; almost criminal. For those looking for a gamble and an entry point, I suppose this may be it. You might get a quick 25-50% return if it bounces a bit or t/o bid emerges. Good luck with that. I'm done with this company.",

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

A thought I had was that this was actually a clever play by tinyBuild. Kingmakers is now number 6 on Wishlist charts. Number 3 and number 5  (Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders) will have been released by the end of October. This puts Kingmakers into #4.  Quite a coveted position for a microcap!. I am sure many of the sellers were just previously following momentum and were just realising their gains. There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

          "content": "Having done my research, these are my final comments about this company, no doubt to the delight of MoneyShark!!! The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

All in all, I see existing shareholders being further screwed with a dilution.  I've lost faith in this. Why should I pay \u00a30.05p a share (on a one for six holding) when I can buy it cheaper on the market for \u00a30.04p ?  The only answer to my own question is that if I pay the \u00a30.05p price, it will prop up the company for another six months, whereupon it will either go under or be bought out or taken privavte for peanuts.",

To all intents this seems to be virtually the same as a rights issue, but without even the benefit of being able to sell on the nil paid rights, which, given the value of the shares, would be basically worthless anyway. One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn.

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

I am sure many of the sellers were just previously following momentum and were just realising their gains. There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

All in all, I see existing shareholders being further screwed with a dilution.  I've lost faith in this. Why should I pay \u00a30.05p a share (on a one for six holding) when I can buy it cheaper on the market for \u00a30.04p ?  The only answer to my own question is that if I pay the \u00a30.05p price, it will prop up the company for another six months, whereupon it will either go under or be bought out or taken privavte for peanuts.",

To all intents this seems to be virtually the same as a rights issue, but without even the benefit of being able to sell on the nil paid rights, which, given the value of the shares, would be basically worthless anyway. One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn. The whole thing would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.",

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

Number 3 and number 5  (Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders) will have been released by the end of October. This puts Kingmakers into #4.  Quite a coveted position for a microcap!. I am sure many of the sellers were just previously following momentum and were just realising their gains. There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

The games industry outlook is slowly climbing out from a deep trough.\nWe are managing our well-diversified catalogue of over 100 titles to maximise revenues from classic titles such as\nHello Neighbor\n, and more recent franchises such as\nDeadside\nand\nVOIN.\nAmong our latest launches,\nThe King is Watching\nand\nOf Ash and Steel\nhave performed well, delivering above expectations.\nOur catalogue generates predictable cash flows, supporting the strategic investment in high-potential new IP such as\nKingmakers\n,\nSAND\nand\nThe Lift\n, and allowing us to expand evergreen franchises, such as\nSpeedRunners 2\nand\nStreets of Rogue 2\n. In a highly competitive market, our priority is to deliver the best possible game we can to meet player's expectations, even if that means a longer development cycle and shifting the release date.\nAs at 31 December 2025, the Company had over $4 million in cash, demonstrating disciplined cash management.\nCash and cash equivalents will continue to fluctuate during 2026, as revenue is expected to improve following the launch of certain high-potential new games.\nThe Company has no borrowings.\nPipeline\nThe positive momentum we are seeing at tinyBuild is translating into a strong performance in terms of wishlists, one of the most important indicators for future sales:\nKingmakers\nis now in the #7 Most Wishlisted Games on Steam,\nSAND\n#47,\nStreets of Rogue 2\n#88 and\nThe Lift\n#144. Recently announced\nHozy\nand\nRestory\nare also attracting good sized audiences.\nThe release schedule remains heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, with only\nHozy\nand\nSAND\ncurrently scheduled for the first half of the year. To mitigate the risk with new launches, we are fully focused on cost control and regularly reviewing our investment in new games to align them with audience validation.\nOutlook\nThe pipeline for 2026 and beyond is strong, it includes several larger-budget (above $1m), high-potential games alongside continuous investment in the catalogue, including updates, DLCs and platform launches.\nThe evolving global macroeconomic situation, and the continued conflict in Ukraine, impose caution and vigilance in the medium and long term. In particular, tinyBuild carefully assesses the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business.\nAlex Nichiporchik, Chief Executive Officer of tinyBuild, commented:\n\"The longevity of our catalogue increases with every year that goes by - Hello Neighbor into the end of last year was insane. That's down to a great team and amazing partners, and together we've delivered strong results through both new titles and evergreen franchises. I'm excited about 2026 and beyond and I want to thank all the people that make this possible.\"\n\u200b\nEnquiries\n:\ntinyBuild, Inc\nAlex Nichiporchik - Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder\nGiasone (Jaz) Salati - Chief Financial Officer\ninvestorrelations@tinybuild.com\nZeus (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nAntonio Bossi/ James Edis (Investment Banking)\nBen Robertson (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 203 829 5000\nSEC Newgate (Financial PR)\nRobin Tozer, Harry Handyside\ntinybuild@secnewgate.co.uk\n+44 (0)7540 106366\nAbout tinyBuild:\nFounded in 2013, tinyBuild (AIM: TBLD) is a global video games publisher and developer, with a catalogue of more than 100 premium titles across different genres. tinyBuild's strategy is to focus on its own intellectual property (IP) to build multi-game and multimedia franchises, in partnership with developers.\ntinyBuild is headquartered in the USA with operations stretching across the Americas and Europe.

The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

Why should I pay \u00a30.05p a share (on a one for six holding) when I can buy it cheaper on the market for \u00a30.04p ?

One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn.

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

A thought I had was that this was actually a clever play by tinyBuild. Kingmakers is now number 6 on Wishlist charts. Number 3 and number 5  (Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders) will have been released by the end of October. This puts Kingmakers into #4.  Quite a coveted position for a microcap!. I am sure many of the sellers were just previously following momentum and were just realising their gains. There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

The post IPO performance of TBLD's share price may have come as a bit of a shock, esp to Alex who owns such a significant chunk of the company, but it seems they may have learned and adjusted. I'm well down on my holding but am actually more hopeful than I've ever been.",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

          "content": "Having done my research, these are my final comments about this company, no doubt to the delight of MoneyShark!!! The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

That leaves them with existing cash which they've been burning through like nobodys business, plus an extra  $10m placing which, no doubt, will have to be taken up by the CEO who has underwritten it. All in all, I see existing shareholders being further screwed with a dilution.  I've lost faith in this. Why should I pay \u00a30.05p a share (on a one for six holding) when I can buy it cheaper on the market for \u00a30.04p ?  The only answer to my own question is that if I pay the \u00a30.05p price, it will prop up the company for another six months, whereupon it will either go under or be bought out or taken privavte for peanuts.",

To all intents this seems to be virtually the same as a rights issue, but without even the benefit of being able to sell on the nil paid rights, which, given the value of the shares, would be basically worthless anyway. One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn.

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

I am sure many of the sellers were just previously following momentum and were just realising their gains. There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

All in all, I see existing shareholders being further screwed with a dilution.  I've lost faith in this. Why should I pay \u00a30.05p a share (on a one for six holding) when I can buy it cheaper on the market for \u00a30.04p ?

To all intents this seems to be virtually the same as a rights issue, but without even the benefit of being able to sell on the nil paid rights, which, given the value of the shares, would be basically worthless anyway. One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn. The whole thing would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.",

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

A thought I had was that this was actually a clever play by tinyBuild. Kingmakers is now number 6 on Wishlist charts. Number 3 and number 5  (Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders) will have been released by the end of October. This puts Kingmakers into #4.  Quite a coveted position for a microcap!. I am sure many of the sellers were just previously following momentum and were just realising their gains. There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",

The emergency cash being raised comes at the expense of private shareholders whose holdings will be virtually wiped out completely, through further dilution. This is an equity raise of about $14million. Atari are taking up about $2million. Nichiporchik is taking up about $10million and the rest is open to retail offer. Nichiporchik, the co-founder, took out \u00a356million (about $70million ) with the IPO in 2021. His underwriting of this recent placing and retail issue is effectively a re-injection of a bit of this money. In my view, this is virtually taking the company private by the back door, but not quite. Shareholders vote today. Over 50% support is needed (not including Niks present 38% holding) to pass the resolution.. With his injection he will have control over 50% of the company. He has also said that if there is not sufficient support, the company will file for chapter11 insolvency. All this came about due to very few people noticing the early capitalisation of development costs that didn't show up in a hit to profitiability. On top of this, the company wasted tens of millions on Verses Evil  and shut it down within two years. Additionally they have faced a couple of serious law suits. The company has been run by games wizards who have virtually zero business acumen, and who in my view are cowboys incapable of running a business. Good old Nik. Down to his last \u00a348,000,000 from the IPO, while the rest of us have lost 97% of our investment at the present price of \u00a30.042p, with the prospect of that going to below a penny. And we never did find out what happened to Luke Burtis' holding and whether he sold or not.  Thanks a bunch Nik.",

All in all, I see existing shareholders being further screwed with a dilution.  I've lost faith in this. Why should I pay \u00a30.05p a share (on a one for six holding) when I can buy it cheaper on the market for \u00a30.04p ?  The only answer to my own question is that if I pay the \u00a30.05p price, it will prop up the company for another six months, whereupon it will either go under or be bought out or taken privavte for peanuts.",

To all intents this seems to be virtually the same as a rights issue, but without even the benefit of being able to sell on the nil paid rights, which, given the value of the shares, would be basically worthless anyway. One simply either 'defaults' by ignoring the offer or buys the extra shares. I have to let I.I . know by the 12th January if I want to pay \u00a30.05p per share (one share for every six held), when the mid-price on the market is \u00a30.04p.  Why on earth would I buy these shares above market price when, once the offer is finished, the price is likely to drop further due to the dilution? Are we being taken for mugs yet again?  Perhaps someone could explain in simple terms why I should be stupid enough to take up this offer. Unless you have entire faith in this cowboy of a CEO who, whilst he knows his way around a games program, appears to have zero business acumen, I suggest shareholders give this a wide berth. I mean, \u00a32.50 to \u00a30.04p in a couple of years is some achievement. All this corporate action for a mere $10 million. The CEO is underwriting this issue. I suspect he will end up acquiring a lot of the untaken offer.  I also suspect that  $10 million will not be nearly enough to save this company given the cash burn.

It's been 3 months since the delay to Kingmakers was announced, when they said \"We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on.\" When they delayed Kingmakers they (the developers) said it would be released 'Soon'. So I guess the question is how long is 'soon', and how long is 'very soon'?! They also said at the same time that FY results would be at least in line with expectations. But nothing on whether that presumed Kingmakers release in FY25 or not. Given they year has now ended, we must be due a trading update to give investors the details that they have been promised. Lack of transparency is what puts me off investing right now. If one can put the Kingmakers fiasco and poor comms out of one's mind, the release slate at end of last year and start of this year looks decent - with 'Of Ash and Steel', 'Ferocious' released in Nov / Dec and seem to have done OK. And All Will Fall and SAND due in Q1. The Kingmakers and Streets of Rogue 2 due 'Soon'. And THE LIFT which looks interesting due at some point in 2026. But as ever with this company, very difficult to link financial performance to the release slate even though it should be relatively straightforward in theory!",

For me the thing stopping me getting back into this at these levels is the poor comms over the last month suggests they don't really have control of the business. If they wanted to delay the release - why not announce this with H1 results in mid Sept, why wait until a few days before it was due? And if it's only minor issues that need to be ironed out (ie things they didn't know about or thought could fix easily a few weeks back with H1 results) then why now delay 'indefinitely'? Does that mean a few weeks or months? Or well into next year? It sort of implies they don't really know, which doesn't give confidence they can sort the issues out. And the longer they leave it, the more they risk losing the interest of players who want the game released and have seen multiple delays already... And then they are sticking to guidance for this year it seems (albeit with caveats re weak market), which they upgraded only a few weeks back. But it's unclear whether or not they need Kingmakers to launch this year in order to get to those upgraded numbers. Tough to get comfortable. If I was confident there was value here even if Kingmakers was cancelled / a flop, then I'd be putting some money in. But think the upside case here was kind of predicated on a successful launch and that's looking less likely now...",

Update on the delay of Kingmakers: \u25cf     Last Friday, Redemption Road Games announced that Kingmakers, previously scheduled for release on October 8, was delayed. \u25cf     Kingmakers is an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game that pushes the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits. \u25cf     The team needs more time to polish content and optimise performance, so even a mid-range PC can achieve true 60fps without the need for fake frames. \u25cf     We will be presenting a 30 minutes deep dive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on. Outlook reiterated \u25cf     2025 started with a strong EBITDA performance, but uncertainty remains about the second part of the year in a crowded market (Steam saw 10% more releases in H1 2025 than H1 2024). \u25cf     The pipeline includes a number of high-potential games; the strong H1 gives management greater flexibility both in terms of development budget and release schedule to achieve the full potential for each title. \u25cf     The implication of the conflict in Ukraine and the evolving macroeconomic situation still impose caution and vigilance. In particular, tinyBuild continues to carefully assess the position of its staff, its exposure in terms of revenues and any other factor that may have an impact on the business. \u25cf     All considered, the Board remains confident the Company is on track to deliver results at least in line with expectations.",

There are of course a lot of unknowns but the facts are tinyBuild have 4 games in top 100 and one of those is likely to be #4 in the next 3 weeks. I am liking the odds of success",

Devolver, Frontier, Team17 all trade at or above 1x revenue with not much better (or worse) prospects, TBLD trades at 0.6x. You do the math. Digital Bros at 1.5x. Remedy at the higher end of AA but similar sized trades at almost 5x! Kingmakers particularly could go gangbusters. Right now it's #19 on the Steam wishlist charts and rising. That is 1m copies pretty much guaranteed going by similar launches in the past. Watching interviews with devs, it's clear this is a solidly AA release with cutting edge AI features, with at least $30-35 as the base price. So at least $30m, most of which will be recognised this year, and a 50% pub share for TBLD. Best of all is this will require almost no marketing, so it flows straight down to cash. The trailer hype alone got millions of hits. If this is hot with streamers, it could do even better. Remember, 2m units = $30m for TBLD, 5m units = $75m.",
