As a result, the\nPenha Heights\nloan facilities are currently in default and the Company's other lending banks have intensified loan monitoring. Furthermore, these financial challenges have contributed to a negative impact on the Company's share price.\nThe Company continues to engage with lenders to negotiate loan extensions and restructuring to allow time to stabilise its capital structure and accelerate asset disposals.\nDespite a continued downturn in Macau's residential market, the Company's divestment programme progressed in H2 2025 with the sale of nine\nWaterside\nunits and the one remaining\nFountainside\nVilla. Market conditions were seen to marginally improve due to recent government measures, including reduced stamp duty charges and more relaxed mortgage lending rules.\nPortfolio Overview\nThe Waterside\nIn H2 2025, the Company sold an additional nine units at\nThe Waterside\n. Recent transactions showed slightly improving trends, with units transacting at narrower discounts to valuation compared to earlier quarters. The Company is negotiating the sale of additional units with several potential purchasers. The Company's available cash resources continue to be restricted by its lender to satisfy covenant conditions, but further cash is expected to be released once further sales are successfully completed.\nA total of 45 units have been sold since the divestment programme began in mid-2022, with 14 units remaining available for sale at the end of 2025. With a number of purchasers expressing a preference for tenanted units, some remaining units, covering approximately 37% of the remaining gross floor area, are let out on short-term leases.\nThe Fountainside\nThe Company sold the final villa at\nThe Fountainside\ntogether with its car-parking space. Having now sold all the villas in the project, the Company is focused on the three reconfigured apartments and two car-parking spaces, the final units available for sale. Sales efforts for these apartments has been delayed by continuing challenges in obtaining approvals for newly built parking spaces as part of the reconfiguration exercise. The Company has held multiple discussions with representatives of the Land and Urban Construction Bureau (DSSCU) to address this and the requested documentation for final review was submitted to DSSCU in December 2025 with feedback by end Q1 2026.\nPenha Heights\nPenha Heights\n, located at the top of the exclusive and historic Penha Hill, represents among the top homes in Macau. The Company's marketing strategy leverages the regional network of ultra-high-net-worth clients maintained by a Hong Kong-based specialist agency. The property is also being promoted as two separate residences, in line with its land titles, to make the pricing more accessible than selling it solely as a single asset.\nFollowing the unsuccessful fund raising, the Company is actively engaged with lenders exploring a variety of options, including asset sales and loan restructuring. Marketing initiatives have generated consistent interest and property viewings, though these have not yet resulted in firm offers, although encouragingly, some traction has been achieved recently with a prospective purchaser. The Company believes that slightly improved sentiment in Macau may provide better opportunities for achieving a divestment.\nProperty\nIn the second half of 2025, Macau's property market showed some signs of recovery. After a first half characterised by stabilised transaction volumes, but falling prices, the market further stabilised later in the year, with both transactions and prices recovering. Q3 residential transaction volumes rose 19.2% QoQ to 955 units, despite a YoY drop of 19%. Residential unit transaction prices in Q3 also increased by 8% QoQ, while decreasing 14% YoY.\nDevelopers have been using more aggressive pricing strategies to clear pre-sale inventories, drawing buyers toward new projects with attractive discounts. This has diverted demand away from second-hand homes, prompting sellers in the secondary market to cut prices to close deals. Consequently, the secondary market experienced steeper declines in both transactions and prices than the broader property market. By the end of October 2025, transaction volumes were down 11.8% YoY, while prices had fallen 17.8% YoY.\nLuxury Market Dynamics\nIn the luxury residential segment, transaction volumes have tracked the overall market weakness. Luxury residential units spanning over 150 sqm totalled 46 units in Q3 2025, representing a YoY decrease of 19%, but a QoQ increase of 48%, possibly indicating early signs of stabilisation in the premium segment. High-end buyers remain cautious after recent price declines and continue to wait for clearer recovery signals. Mainland investor demand is constrained by capital controls and financing scrutiny, while local income growth outside gaming is limited. The luxury segment is stabilising rather than rebounding, with activity improving selectively since the recent government measures, but buyers retaining strong bargaining power.\nGovernment Measures to Revitalise Property Sector\nIn its 2026 Policy Address, the Macau government unveiled several initiatives aimed at revitalising the property market. The first MOP6 million of a residential property's purchase price will now be exempt from stamp duty, up from the previous threshold of MOP3 million. In addition, mortgage rules are being eased, with the permitted loan-to-value ratio raised from 70% to 80%, making it easier for buyers to obtain financing.\nAlthough industry participants generally view these steps positively, many believe they will fall short of fully restoring market momentum. The measures are expected to lift transaction activity for entry level units; however, while they may help stabilise prices and curb further declines, they are unlikely to spark a strong rebound in property values without additional stimulus.\nEconomy, Tourism & Gaming\nAfter a slow start in the first half of 2025, Macau's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) powered to 8.0% growth YoY in the third quarter of 2025, fuelled primarily by a 13.6% rise in visitor arrivals. For the first nine months of the year, GDP grew 4.2% YoY to 88.4% of pre-pandemic levels. Analysts have forecasted full year GDP growth for the territory of 5.4% YoY\n2025 proved to be a record-breaking year for visitor arrivals in Macau. Full-year arrivals of 40.06 million have now established a new all-time high for the territory, exceeding the previous peak of 39.4 million set in 2019 by 1.6% and surpassing 2024 arrivals by 14.7%.\nIn the second half of 2025, in line with the surge in visitor arrivals, gaming revenue saw several record-setting double-digit year-on-year growth months. October 2025 recorded MOP24.09 billion (c.US$ 3 billion), the best monthly performance since January 2020, representing a 15.9% YoY increase. As at November, the year-to-date gaming revenue was approximately MOP226.5 billion (c.US$ 28 billion), which is 8.6% higher than the first 11 months of 2024.\nOutlook\nDespite global and regional volatility, Macau's headline economic numbers have demonstrated the territory's resilience. Growth forecasts for full year 2026 GDP have ranged from 2% to 5%, which translates to approximately 93% of 2019's pre-pandemic levels.\nDespite strong economic fundamentals and continued growth, Macau's economic activity has been primarily concentrated in the tourism and gaming sectors. There has been limited spillover to the luxury residential market, which remains subdued. High-end buyers remain cautious following years of price declines and continue to wait for clearer recovery signals.\nIn light of these challenges, the Company will continue to vigorously progress its divestment strategy, while working with lenders to stabilise its financial position and execute its divestment programme. The Government's comprehensive policy package, combined with strong economic fundamentals, creates a more supportive environment for residential property sales in 2026.\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nPremium listed on the London Stock Exchange,\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\nis a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's leading gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

The US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate was 1.372 as at 30 June 2025.\nThe regional real estate sector remains weak, with valuations continuing to decline albeit at a slower rate. The Company continues to achieve sales in the execution of its divestment strategy, however cash flow remains restricted, requiring disciplined expenditure management and prioritization of essential commitments.\nThe Company is in ongoing discussions with its lenders regarding the Penha Heights facilities, where potential lender enforcement could result in expedited sales of the two units at reduced prices. In such circumstances, valuations would likely be under further pressure. As disclosed in recent announcements, the Company is actively seeking to divest of Penha Heights, however there is no certainty that proceeds from an accelerated sale would equal or exceed the outstanding loan balance. This may lead to a series of events, including but not limited to the inability to repay secured loans, the forced disposal of other properties on a distressed basis under the Company's guarantee provisions, and restrictions on any distribution of returns to Shareholders.\nNote:\n1. The above figures are estimates only and are unaudited and derived from independently assessed valuations.

Due to the parent company guarantees under the Penha Heights banking facilities and cross-default provisions in the Group's financing documents, there is also a risk that the Group could become obligated to dispose of its other outstanding properties on an expedited and/or depressed basis, and could lead to the need for restructuring, liquidation or insolvency proceedings and Shareholders losing all or part of their investment.\nSeparately, the Company notes that it has exchanged contracts in respect of the sale of a further two units at The Waterside, which are expected to complete in Q1 of 2026. Following completion of these sales, 14 units remain available for sale. In addition, following completion of recent sales at The Waterside, the loan-to-value ratio has reduced below the 60% covenant limit for the property's banking facility (versus 64.5% at 30 June 2025).\nStock Code\nLondon Stock Exchange: MPO\nLEI\n213800NOAO11OWIMLR72\nFor further information:\nManager\nSniper Capital Limited\nGroup Communications\nTel: +853 2870 5151\nEmail:\ninfo@snipercapital.com\nCorporate Broker, Financial Adviser and Sole Bookrunner\nPanmure Liberum Limited\nDarren Vickers\nTel: +44 20 3100 2222\nCompany Secretary & Administrator\nOcorian Administration (Guernsey) Limited\nKevin Smith\nTel: +44 14 8174 2742\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nListed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\nis a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's leading gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.
