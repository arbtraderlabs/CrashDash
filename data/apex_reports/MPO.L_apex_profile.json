As a result, the\nPenha Heights\nloan facilities are currently in default and the Company's other lending banks have intensified loan monitoring. Furthermore, these financial challenges have contributed to a negative impact on the Company's share price.\nThe Company continues to engage with lenders to negotiate loan extensions and restructuring to allow time to stabilise its capital structure and accelerate asset disposals.\nDespite a continued downturn in Macau's residential market, the Company's divestment programme progressed in H2 2025 with the sale of nine\nWaterside\nunits and the one remaining\nFountainside\nVilla. Market conditions were seen to marginally improve due to recent government measures, including reduced stamp duty charges and more relaxed mortgage lending rules.\nPortfolio Overview\nThe Waterside\nIn H2 2025, the Company sold an additional nine units at\nThe Waterside\n. Recent transactions showed slightly improving trends, with units transacting at narrower discounts to valuation compared to earlier quarters. The Company is negotiating the sale of additional units with several potential purchasers. The Company's available cash resources continue to be restricted by its lender to satisfy covenant conditions, but further cash is expected to be released once further sales are successfully completed.\nA total of 45 units have been sold since the divestment programme began in mid-2022, with 14 units remaining available for sale at the end of 2025. With a number of purchasers expressing a preference for tenanted units, some remaining units, covering approximately 37% of the remaining gross floor area, are let out on short-term leases.\nThe Fountainside\nThe Company sold the final villa at\nThe Fountainside\ntogether with its car-parking space. Having now sold all the villas in the project, the Company is focused on the three reconfigured apartments and two car-parking spaces, the final units available for sale. Sales efforts for these apartments has been delayed by continuing challenges in obtaining approvals for newly built parking spaces as part of the reconfiguration exercise. The Company has held multiple discussions with representatives of the Land and Urban Construction Bureau (DSSCU) to address this and the requested documentation for final review was submitted to DSSCU in December 2025 with feedback by end Q1 2026.\nPenha Heights\nPenha Heights\n, located at the top of the exclusive and historic Penha Hill, represents among the top homes in Macau. The Company's marketing strategy leverages the regional network of ultra-high-net-worth clients maintained by a Hong Kong-based specialist agency. The property is also being promoted as two separate residences, in line with its land titles, to make the pricing more accessible than selling it solely as a single asset.\nFollowing the unsuccessful fund raising, the Company is actively engaged with lenders exploring a variety of options, including asset sales and loan restructuring. Marketing initiatives have generated consistent interest and property viewings, though these have not yet resulted in firm offers, although encouragingly, some traction has been achieved recently with a prospective purchaser. The Company believes that slightly improved sentiment in Macau may provide better opportunities for achieving a divestment.\nProperty\nIn the second half of 2025, Macau's property market showed some signs of recovery. After a first half characterised by stabilised transaction volumes, but falling prices, the market further stabilised later in the year, with both transactions and prices recovering. Q3 residential transaction volumes rose 19.2% QoQ to 955 units, despite a YoY drop of 19%. Residential unit transaction prices in Q3 also increased by 8% QoQ, while decreasing 14% YoY.\nDevelopers have been using more aggressive pricing strategies to clear pre-sale inventories, drawing buyers toward new projects with attractive discounts. This has diverted demand away from second-hand homes, prompting sellers in the secondary market to cut prices to close deals. Consequently, the secondary market experienced steeper declines in both transactions and prices than the broader property market. By the end of October 2025, transaction volumes were down 11.8% YoY, while prices had fallen 17.8% YoY.\nLuxury Market Dynamics\nIn the luxury residential segment, transaction volumes have tracked the overall market weakness. Luxury residential units spanning over 150 sqm totalled 46 units in Q3 2025, representing a YoY decrease of 19%, but a QoQ increase of 48%, possibly indicating early signs of stabilisation in the premium segment. High-end buyers remain cautious after recent price declines and continue to wait for clearer recovery signals. Mainland investor demand is constrained by capital controls and financing scrutiny, while local income growth outside gaming is limited. The luxury segment is stabilising rather than rebounding, with activity improving selectively since the recent government measures, but buyers retaining strong bargaining power.\nGovernment Measures to Revitalise Property Sector\nIn its 2026 Policy Address, the Macau government unveiled several initiatives aimed at revitalising the property market. The first MOP6 million of a residential property's purchase price will now be exempt from stamp duty, up from the previous threshold of MOP3 million. In addition, mortgage rules are being eased, with the permitted loan-to-value ratio raised from 70% to 80%, making it easier for buyers to obtain financing.\nAlthough industry participants generally view these steps positively, many believe they will fall short of fully restoring market momentum. The measures are expected to lift transaction activity for entry level units; however, while they may help stabilise prices and curb further declines, they are unlikely to spark a strong rebound in property values without additional stimulus.\nEconomy, Tourism & Gaming\nAfter a slow start in the first half of 2025, Macau's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) powered to 8.0% growth YoY in the third quarter of 2025, fuelled primarily by a 13.6% rise in visitor arrivals. For the first nine months of the year, GDP grew 4.2% YoY to 88.4% of pre-pandemic levels. Analysts have forecasted full year GDP growth for the territory of 5.4% YoY\n2025 proved to be a record-breaking year for visitor arrivals in Macau. Full-year arrivals of 40.06 million have now established a new all-time high for the territory, exceeding the previous peak of 39.4 million set in 2019 by 1.6% and surpassing 2024 arrivals by 14.7%.\nIn the second half of 2025, in line with the surge in visitor arrivals, gaming revenue saw several record-setting double-digit year-on-year growth months. October 2025 recorded MOP24.09 billion (c.US$ 3 billion), the best monthly performance since January 2020, representing a 15.9% YoY increase. As at November, the year-to-date gaming revenue was approximately MOP226.5 billion (c.US$ 28 billion), which is 8.6% higher than the first 11 months of 2024.\nOutlook\nDespite global and regional volatility, Macau's headline economic numbers have demonstrated the territory's resilience. Growth forecasts for full year 2026 GDP have ranged from 2% to 5%, which translates to approximately 93% of 2019's pre-pandemic levels.\nDespite strong economic fundamentals and continued growth, Macau's economic activity has been primarily concentrated in the tourism and gaming sectors. There has been limited spillover to the luxury residential market, which remains subdued. High-end buyers remain cautious following years of price declines and continue to wait for clearer recovery signals.\nIn light of these challenges, the Company will continue to vigorously progress its divestment strategy, while working with lenders to stabilise its financial position and execute its divestment programme. The Government's comprehensive policy package, combined with strong economic fundamentals, creates a more supportive environment for residential property sales in 2026.\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nPremium listed on the London Stock Exchange,\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\nis a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's leading gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

The US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate was 1.372 as at 30 June 2025.\nThe regional real estate sector remains weak, with valuations continuing to decline albeit at a slower rate. The Company continues to achieve sales in the execution of its divestment strategy, however cash flow remains restricted, requiring disciplined expenditure management and prioritization of essential commitments.\nThe Company is in ongoing discussions with its lenders regarding the Penha Heights facilities, where potential lender enforcement could result in expedited sales of the two units at reduced prices. In such circumstances, valuations would likely be under further pressure. As disclosed in recent announcements, the Company is actively seeking to divest of Penha Heights, however there is no certainty that proceeds from an accelerated sale would equal or exceed the outstanding loan balance. This may lead to a series of events, including but not limited to the inability to repay secured loans, the forced disposal of other properties on a distressed basis under the Company's guarantee provisions, and restrictions on any distribution of returns to Shareholders.\nNote:\n1.

Due to the parent company guarantees under the Penha Heights banking facilities and cross-default provisions in the Group's financing documents, there is also a risk that the Group could become obligated to dispose of its other outstanding properties on an expedited and/or depressed basis, and could lead to the need for restructuring, liquidation or insolvency proceedings and Shareholders losing all or part of their investment.\nSeparately, the Company notes that it has exchanged contracts in respect of the sale of a further two units at The Waterside, which are expected to complete in Q1 of 2026. Following completion of these sales, 14 units remain available for sale. In addition, following completion of recent sales at The Waterside, the loan-to-value ratio has reduced below the 60% covenant limit for the property's banking facility (versus 64.5% at 30 June 2025).\nStock Code\nLondon Stock Exchange: MPO\nLEI\n213800NOAO11OWIMLR72\nFor further information:\nManager\nSniper Capital Limited\nGroup Communications\nTel: +853 2870 5151\nEmail:\ninfo@snipercapital.com\nCorporate Broker, Financial Adviser and Sole Bookrunner\nPanmure Liberum Limited\nDarren Vickers\nTel: +44 20 3100 2222\nCompany Secretary & Administrator\nOcorian Administration (Guernsey) Limited\nKevin Smith\nTel: +44 14 8174 2742\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nListed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\nis a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's leading gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

As a result, the\nPenha Heights\nloan facilities are currently in default and the Company's other lending banks have intensified loan monitoring. Furthermore, these financial challenges have contributed to a negative impact on the Company's share price.\nThe Company continues to engage with lenders to negotiate loan extensions and restructuring to allow time to stabilise its capital structure and accelerate asset disposals.\nDespite a continued downturn in Macau's residential market, the Company's divestment programme progressed in H2 2025 with the sale of nine\nWaterside\nunits and the one remaining\nFountainside\nVilla. Market conditions were seen to marginally improve due to recent government measures, including reduced stamp duty charges and more relaxed mortgage lending rules.\nPortfolio Overview\nThe Waterside\nIn H2 2025, the Company sold an additional nine units at\nThe Waterside\n. Recent transactions showed slightly improving trends, with units transacting at narrower discounts to valuation compared to earlier quarters. The Company is negotiating the sale of additional units with several potential purchasers. The Company's available cash resources continue to be restricted by its lender to satisfy covenant conditions, but further cash is expected to be released once further sales are successfully completed.\nA total of 45 units have been sold since the divestment programme began in mid-2022, with 14 units remaining available for sale at the end of 2025. With a number of purchasers expressing a preference for tenanted units, some remaining units, covering approximately 37% of the remaining gross floor area, are let out on short-term leases.\nThe Fountainside\nThe Company sold the final villa at\nThe Fountainside\ntogether with its car-parking space. Having now sold all the villas in the project, the Company is focused on the three reconfigured apartments and two car-parking spaces, the final units available for sale. Sales efforts for these apartments has been delayed by continuing challenges in obtaining approvals for newly built parking spaces as part of the reconfiguration exercise. The Company has held multiple discussions with representatives of the Land and Urban Construction Bureau (DSSCU) to address this and the requested documentation for final review was submitted to DSSCU in December 2025 with feedback by end Q1 2026.\nPenha Heights\nPenha Heights\n, located at the top of the exclusive and historic Penha Hill, represents among the top homes in Macau. The Company's marketing strategy leverages the regional network of ultra-high-net-worth clients maintained by a Hong Kong-based specialist agency. The property is also being promoted as two separate residences, in line with its land titles, to make the pricing more accessible than selling it solely as a single asset.\nFollowing the unsuccessful fund raising, the Company is actively engaged with lenders exploring a variety of options, including asset sales and loan restructuring. Marketing initiatives have generated consistent interest and property viewings, though these have not yet resulted in firm offers, although encouragingly, some traction has been achieved recently with a prospective purchaser. The Company believes that slightly improved sentiment in Macau may provide better opportunities for achieving a divestment.\nProperty\nIn the second half of 2025, Macau's property market showed some signs of recovery. After a first half characterised by stabilised transaction volumes, but falling prices, the market further stabilised later in the year, with both transactions and prices recovering. Q3 residential transaction volumes rose 19.2% QoQ to 955 units, despite a YoY drop of 19%. Residential unit transaction prices in Q3 also increased by 8% QoQ, while decreasing 14% YoY.\nDevelopers have been using more aggressive pricing strategies to clear pre-sale inventories, drawing buyers toward new projects with attractive discounts. This has diverted demand away from second-hand homes, prompting sellers in the secondary market t",

The US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate was 1.372 as at 30 June 2025.\nThe regional real estate sector remains weak, with valuations continuing to decline albeit at a slower rate. The Company continues to achieve sales in the execution of its divestment strategy, however cash flow remains restricted, requiring disciplined expenditure management and prioritization of essential commitments.\nThe Company is in ongoing discussions with its lenders regarding the Penha Heights facilities, where potential lender enforcement could result in expedited sales of the two units at reduced prices. In such circumstances, valuations would likely be under further pressure. As disclosed in recent announcements, the Company is actively seeking to divest of Penha Heights, however there is no certainty that proceeds from an accelerated sale would equal or exceed the outstanding loan balance. This may lead to a series of events, including but not limited to the inability to repay secured loans, the forced disposal of other properties on a distressed basis under the Company's guarantee provisions, and restrictions on any distribution of returns to Shareholders.\nNote:\n1. The above figures are estimates only and are unaudited and derived from independently assessed valuations.

Due to the parent company guarantees under the Penha Heights banking facilities and cross-default provisions in the Group's financing documents, there is also a risk that the Group could become obligated to dispose of its other outstanding properties on an expedited and/or depressed basis, and could lead to the need for restructuring, liquidation or insolvency proceedings and Shareholders losing all or part of their investment.\nSeparately, the Company notes that it has exchanged contracts in respect of the sale of a further two units at The Waterside, which are expected to complete in Q1 of 2026. Following completion of these sales, 14 units remain available for sale. In addition, following completion of recent sales at The Waterside, the loan-to-value ratio has reduced below the 60% covenant limit for the property's banking facility (versus 64.5% at 30 June 2025).\nStock Code\nLondon Stock Exchange: MPO\nLEI\n213800NOAO11OWIMLR72\nFor further information:\nManager\nSniper Capital Limited\nGroup Communications\nTel: +853 2870 5151\nEmail:\ninfo@snipercapital.com\nCorporate Broker, Financial Adviser and Sole Bookrunner\nPanmure Liberum Limited\nDarren Vickers\nTel: +44 20 3100 2222\nCompany Secretary & Administrator\nOcorian Administration (Guernsey) Limited\nKevin Smith\nTel: +44 14 8174 2742\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nListed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\nis a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's leading gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

The Company will seek to continue its discussions with its lenders and, if possible, accelerate the sale of properties, but there is no certainty as to the outcome.\nAbsent agreement to the contrary, if the Company were unable to satisfy the above payments when they become due, the lenders could demand accelerated repayment of part and/or all outstanding amounts due and/or call on parent guarantees given by the Company to relevant borrower entities, and cross-default provisions across the Group's other facilities could be triggered. This could ultimately result in expedited and enforced sales of the two Penha Heights units by the lenders (including at depressed prices) and/or the Group being required to satisfy demand for payment of all outstanding monies due in respect of Penha Heights through other means (which the Company does not anticipate being able to do given its current working capital and liquidity position).\nDue to prevailing market conditions, there is no certainty that, in the case of lender enforcement, Penha Heights could be sold for an amount equal to or above the outstanding loan amounts secured against it which could result in the Group not being able to satisfy the loans secured against Penha Heights nor being able to distribute any returns to Shareholders in respect of that property. Due to the parent company guarantees under the Penha Heights banking facilities and cross-default provisions in the Group's financing documents, there is also a risk that the Group could become obligated to dispose of its other outstanding properties on an expedited and/or depressed basis, and this could lead to the need for restructuring, liquidation or insolvency proceedings and Shareholders losing all or part of their investment.\nThe Company will be actively seeking to avoid any default situation and is taking advice on its position. A further update will be issued in due course.\nStock Code\nLondon Stock Exchange: MPO\nLEI\n213800NOAO11OWIMLR72\nFor further information:\nManager\nSniper Capital Limited\nGroup Communications\nTel: +853 2870 5151\nEmail:\ninfo@snipercapital.com\nCorporate Broker, Financial Adviser and Sole Bookrunner\nPanmure Liberum Limited\nDarren Vickers\nTel: +44 20 3100 2222\nCompany Secretary & Administrator\nOcorian Administration (Guernsey) Limited\nKevin Smith\nTel: +44 14 8174 2742\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nListed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\nis a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's leading gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO TAKE PART IN THE PLACING.\n17 November 2025\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\n(\"MPO\" or the \"Company\")\nProposed placing of New Ordinary Shares\nFurther to the announcement of the Company's annual results on 31 October 2025, the Company announces a placing (the \"\nPlacing\n\") of new ordinary shares (\"\nNew\nOrdinary Shares\n\") in the Company.\nThe Placing will comprise an issuance of up to\n12,367,146\nNew Ordinary Shares on a bookbuild basis.\nThe Company is also publishing a circular (the \"\nCircular\n\") today in connection with the proposed Placing convening an extraordinary general meeting to be held at 09.00 a.m. on 4 December 2025.\nBookbuild\nThe Placing will be launched immediately following this announcement, when Panmure Liberum (who are acting as bookrunner for the Placing) will commence a bookbuilding process to determine the level of demand from potential investors for participation in the Placing.\nThe New Ordinary Shares are not being offered at a fixed price. To bid in the bookbuild, investors should communicate their bid (or bids) by telephone\nto their usual sales contact at Panmure Liberum. Each bid should state the number of New Ordinary Shares for which the prospective investor wishes to subscribe and the price or price range that the prospective investor is offering to pay.\nThe number of New Ordinary Shares to be issued and the price per New Ordinary Share (the \"\nStrike Price\n\") will be agreed between Panmure Liberum and the Company following close of the bookbuild at 2.00 p.m. Friday, 21 November 2025, and announced shortly thereafter.\nBased on the expected minimum fundraising requirement of \u00a31.7 million, and assuming the maximum amount of New Ordinary Shares are issued (12,367,146 New Ordinary Shares), investors should note that the Strike Price is not expected to be less than 13.75 pence.\nThe Issue will be made to relevant persons (as defined in the appendix to this announcement (the \"\nAppendix\n\")) through the Bookrunner and will be subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix.\nBackground and use of proceeds\nAs previously announced, the Company continues to carefully manage its asset divestment programme to maximise shareholder value, whilst ensuring sufficient cashflow is generated from asset divestment to meet the Company's requirements and obligations to its lending partners and service providers. The Company's current divestment programme targets the completion of the sale of all remaining assets by December 2026.\nOver the sixteen-month period up to 14 November 2025, the Company successfully divested assets amounting to c.US$43.0 million in aggregate. As a consequence, total indebtedness has substantially reduced by 44 per cent. over such period (from c. US$82.8 million as at 30 June 2024 to c. US$46.5 million as at 14 November 2025).\nHowever, amid tightening credit conditions, lender positions have hardened and the majority of the sale proceeds from disposals have been allocated towards deleveraging, with limited available funds for general working capital purposes and immediate debt servicing obligations. While the Company continues to make progress with its sales programme, the Placing is required in order to meet near term liquidity requirements such that divestment momentum can be maintained in an orderly manner and the Company can execute its plan to achieve the best exit values available, balancing the timescales and need to meet lender repayment schedules. Although dilutive to the net asset value per Ordinary Share, the Placing is considered necessary to preserve Shareholder value and mitigate the risk of accelerated and/or depressed asset sales in the context of timing mismatch between cash inflows and scheduled repayment obligations.\nThe Company continues to work closely with its lending partners and has secured an extension of its loan facilities for\nThe Waterside\nand\nThe Fountainside\nto September 2026. In addition, the Company has also extended its Pe",

The Company, which is managed by Sniper Capital Limited, holds strategic property investments in Macau.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFund performance\n\u00b7\nOn a combined basis, from July 2024 to October 2025, a total of 18 assets at\nThe Waterside\nand\nThe Fountainside\nwere divested generating US$36.2 million (HK$282.6million) of sales proceeds.\n\u00b7\nDebt levels significantly reduced by US$22.8 million during the financial year falling from US$82.8 million to US$60.0 million. Since the financial year-end, a further reduction of US$13.5 million has been achieved as of 30 October 2025.\n\u00b7\nMPO's portfolio value1 declined 16% over the year to US$101.5 million.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted NAV was US$ 37.6 million, which translates to US$0.61 (44 pence2) per share, a 43.1% decrease year-on-year (YoY).\n\u00b7\nIFRS NAV was US$31.5 million or US$0.51 (37 pence2) per share, a 32.2% decrease YoY.\nCapital management\n\u00b7\nAs at 30 June 2025, the total assets on the Company's balance sheet (two of which were carried at cost) were valued at US$96.9 million, while its aggregate liabilities were US$65.5 million.\n\u00b7\nThe consolidated cash balance was\u00a0c.US$1.53 million, of which\u00a0US$1.41 million\u00a0was pledged as collateral for credit facilities.\n\u00b7\nGross borrowings stood at\u00a0US$60 million, equating to a loan-to-value ratio of 58.3%, an increase of 5.8% over the period.\n\u00b7\nLower valuations have impacted the Company's Adjusted Net Asset Value and also the loan-to-value ratios.\n\u00b7\nThe Group renegotiated several banking facilities during and after the financial year, involving extensions and partial settlements to align divestment plans, operational needs, and sales targets.\n\u00b7\nRecognising the late stage of life of the Company, the pace of progress achieved in respect of the Group's divestment programme and the expected timeframe over which the remaining assets are expected to be realised, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis other than that of a going concern.\n\u00b7\nThe Company intends to proceed with a modest equity capital raise which will supplement sales to ensure that debt repayments are met as well as meeting short-term working capital obligations. Should this be successful it is deemed to deliver a better outcome for investors.\n\u00b7\nShould the capital raise be unsuccessful the options for the Company will be adverse in terms of the overall outcome. The possibility will exist that a bank loan default could be possible if assets were unable to be sold. It is projected that the Company may remain viable subject to the continuing divestment of assets but it will undoubtedly be significantly impacted.\n1\nCalculation was adjusted to reflect\nlike-for-like comparisons to 30 June 2025 due to the divestment of properties during the period.\n2\nBased on the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate of 1.372 on 30 June 2025.\nPORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nThe Waterside\n- The Manager continued to advance the strata sales programme at The Waterside. The successful divestment of nine units during the financial year, followed by five more after year-end, brings the cumulative total to 41 units, realising a combined HK$834.5 million (US$106.7 million).\n- Regarding the post-year-end sales, four of the five units have been completed as of 30 October 2025, with completion of the remaining unit expected prior to the end of 2025. The property's 18 remaining available units are primarily located on higher floors.\n- The current leasing programme has largely been terminated to prioritise sales, with only selective short-term leases now considered. As of the end of the period, approximately 37% of\nThe Waterside\n's remaining apartments were occupied.\n\u00b7\nThe Fountainside\n- Three of the four villas at The Fountainside were divested during the financial year for a total consideration of HK$41.4 million (US$5.3 million), with two transactions completed during the period-and one transaction completed post year-end. The fourth villa was also sold following year end, subject to completion in January 2026.\n- The sales campaign for the three smaller units has continued to be hampered by bureaucratic challenges which the Manager is working towards resolving.\n\u00b7\nPenha Heights\n- The Company continues to actively seek a divestment of this flagship asset. The Manager has engaged a firm of specialist Hong Kong real estate agents to boost the marketing effort across the region, including within mainland China.\n- In October, the Company secured a loan extension with Penha Heights lender BCM Bank to extend the loan to end of January 2026.\nMark Huntley, Chairman of Macau Property Opportunities Fund, said:\n\"Our property divestment programme continued during the period with nine units sold at The Waterside and a further five units sold ",

The Company's primary source of working capital continues to be through the net proceeds of ongoing property sales, either individually or en bloc, which are also funding the Company's scheduled debt repayments.\nManagement of covenants and repayment schedules necessarily has a close interplay with the Company's operating cashflow. As valuations have declined, lenders' positions have noticeably hardened and the Company continues to strictly and carefully manage its working capital position to meet obligations both to its lending partners and its service providers.\nThe Company has successfully secured an extension of its loan facilities for The Waterside and The Fountainside to September 2026. The revised agreement features a structured repayment schedule, ensuring capital management is coordinated with the inflow of sales proceeds and debt servicing obligations over the extended term. In addition, the Company has also extended its Penha Heights loan facility to January 2026. This relatively short extension period underscores the importance of maintaining liquidity and optimising the timing of asset disposal. The extension of the Penha Heights facility is subject to the Company paying an instalment on the loan of HK$12m (U$1.5m) by 30 November 2025, although the Company continues to be in active dialogue with the lender.\nIn light of the continued challenges faced by the Company the Directors are considering all options, including the potential of an equity capital raise to meet short term working capital obligations and provide a more stable platform for the orderly completion of the divestment process, which can preserve greater value for shareholders. The Board continue to believe that a carefully managed divestment process is in the best interest of all shareholders and that unnecessary acceleration of the divestment of the portfolio, or any forced sale of assets, would produce a poor outcome for shareholders.\nThe Company continues to work actively towards the publication of the Company's annual report and accounts for the period ended 30 June 2025, in conjunction with its auditors, by 31 October 2025, in accordance with the UK's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nNote:\n1.

In response to prevailing market conditions and in order to meet the Company's ongoing financial obligations, strategic price adjustments and discounts have been necessary for asset disposals. Given the sustained weakness in demand and declining valuations, pricing pressure is expected to persist over the medium term.\nThe Company's cash flow remains restricted, requiring it to manage expenditures and to prioritise essential financial commitments, which it is doing in conjunction with its lending partners.

The recovery of gaming and tourism has stabilised while uncertainty continues to loom over the domestic property sector. Four sales at The Waterside were achieved, and the Company exchanged contracts for the sale of another villa at The Fountainside. The gross sales proceeds since the divestment programme commenced in mid-2022 stands at HK$800.1 million (c.US$102.3 million).\nPortfolio\nThe Waterside\nThe Company achieved new sales of four standard units at The Waterside for a total consideration of HKD 61.8 million (US$7.9 million) in H1 2025, with three units subject to completion in Q3. Negotiations continue on other units which have yet to convert to reportable sales. As a result, in total, 36 units have now been sold since the divestment programme began in mid-2022, with 23 units remaining available for sale as of 30 Jun. As a significant number of prospective purchasers have expressed a preference for tenanted units, pending their sale, a number of the remaining units are leased on a short-term basis reflecting an occupancy rate of 42% of the total available gross floor\narea, with rents at an average of HK$18.36 (US$2.33) per square foot per month. Further sales are being negotiated in what continues to be challenging conditions for the Macau real estate market.\nThe Fountainside\nAt The Fountainside, the Company sold an additional villa together with its car-parking space for a total consideration of HK$14.5 million (c.US$1.85 million). The sale is scheduled for completion in Q3 2025. With this sale, three out of the development's four villas have now been sold, and active discussions are in progress with prospective purchasers on the final villa.\nIn addition, the three reconfigured apartments and two car-parking spaces remain available for sale. The sales effort has been hampered by continuing challenges in obtaining approvals for newly built parking spaces as part of the reconfiguration exercise. The Company continues to pursue the resolution of these bureaucratic issues.\nPenha Heights\nPenha Heights, located at the top of the exclusive and historic Penha Hill, is among the top homes in Macau. The Company's marketing approach for the property includes tapping the regional client network of ultra-high-net-worth individuals of a Hong Kong-based firm of specialist property agents.\nAlthough these efforts have led to ongoing viewings by potential purchasers, they have not yet resulted in firm offers. However, the Company remains in proactive discussions with several interested parties to facilitate a sale of Penha Heights.\nProperty\nMacau's property recovery loses momentum\nAlthough the Macau property sector had demonstrated a nascent recovery in 2024 driven by interest rate cuts and changes in government policy, the market had lost its momentum by the first quarter of 2025. During that period, the residential sector saw declines in terms of both transaction volumes as well as prices - 754 residential property sales were recorded, which represented a drop of 130 transactions or 15% lower quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). In terms of value, the drop was sharper with the total transactions value falling 27% QoQ. Overall average prices in the first quarter were 6% lower QoQ.\nExisting residential units were worse hit than new homes offered by developers with the volume of transactions 18% lower QoQ while total transactions value recorded a steep fall of 29% QoQ. Nevertheless, in April, the residential property market appeared to have stemmed the decline. Sales volumes had increased 19.9% MoM while prices rose slightly by 1.5% MoM. New approvals of residential mortgage loans had also increased 7.2% MoM in March.\nOn the other hand, rental yields for residential properties had surged to a three-year high in the first quarter of 2025 with a 4.5% increase YoY.\nLuxury market tracks overall sector performance\nIn the luxury residential segment, the volume and value of transactions have largely tracked the overall market. The number of sales transactions expanded in the later part of 2024 in response to the p",

The Company, which is managed by Sniper Capital Limited, holds strategic property investments in\u00a0Macau.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFund performance\n\u00b7\nMPO's portfolio value\n1\nwas\u00a0US$126 million\u00a0as at 31 December 2024, a decrease of 2.4% over the six-month period.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Net Asset Value (NAV) was\u00a0US$57 million, which translates to\u00a0US$0.92\u00a0(73 pence\n2\n) per share, a decline of 13.8% over the period.\n\u00b7\nIFRS NAV was\u00a0US$44.9 million\u00a0as at the period end, equating to\u00a0US$0.73\u00a0(58 pence\n2\n) per share, a drop of 3.2% over the period.\nCapital management\n\u00b7\nThe consolidated cash balance was\u00a0c.US$1.7 million, of which\u00a0US$1.2 million\u00a0was pledged as collateral for credit facilities.\n\u00b7\nGross borrowings stood at\u00a0US$65 million, equating to a loan-to-value ratio of 50.9% from 52.5%, an improvement of 1.6% over the period.\n\u00b7\nLoan repayments of US$17.7 million (HK$141.3 million) made in the period. Subsequent to the period end, US$0.1 million repaid and a further US$2.7 million scheduled for March from completions of sales post period end.\nExtension of Company life\n\u00b7\nAt the Company's Annual General Meeting in December, shareholders agreed to a further extension of the Company's life until December 2025.\n1\nCalculation was adjusted to reflect\nlike-for-like comparisons to 31 December 2024 due to the divestment of properties during the period.\n2\nBased on the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate of 1.256 on 31 December 2024.\nPORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nThe Waterside\n- In the second half of 2024, the Company sold a further five units for a total gross value of US$11.5 million. One of these units is expected to complete in March 2025, post the period end.\n- To date, a total of 32 units have been sold representing 54% of the total. As of the end of 2024, 27 units remain available for sale.\n- The Manager is in active discussion with the lender to reschedule part of the March loan repayment to sales should that be required.\n- The current leasing programme has largely been terminated to prioritise sales, with only selective short-term leases now considered. As of the end of 2024, over 50% of\nThe Waterside\n's remaining apartments were occupied.\n\u00b7\nThe Fountainside\n- The Company sold two villas during the period at discounts to the latest valuations, but at an average premium of 46% over the original costs.One villa sale has completed and the second is scheduled for March with proceeds applied to debt repayment.\n- The sales campaign for the three smaller units has continued to be hampered by bureaucratic challenges which the Manager is working towards resolving.\n\u00b7\nPenha Heights\n- The Company has engaged a firm of specialist Hong Kong real estate agents to boost the marketing effort to the region, including mainland China.\n- Negotiations are ongoing with lenders to extend near term debt instalments and the remaining balances into the latter half of 2025, allowing additional time for the planned property disposal.\nMark Huntley, Chairman of Macau Property Opportunities Fund, said:\n\"\nWhile Macau's economy continues to demonstrate recovery driven by its two economic motors - gaming and tourism - the real estate market is subdued with conditions remaining challenging. Small and medium-sized enterprises, retail, and some elements of hospitality, also continue to display weakness.\n\"\nAgainst the backdrop of market-driven factors and the economic imbalances described above, the Manager continued to implement our divestment strategy and has successfully concluded further sales which has led to a reduction in debt levels and the restoration of working capital balances.\n\"\nOur clear focus is on reducing debt through active divestment, aligning debt repayments with our property sales to manage repayments and also lowering debt servicing costs that continue to weigh on returns.\n\"\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.mpofund.com\nfor the Company's full Interim Report 2024.\nThe Manager will be available to speak to analysts and the media. If you would like to arrange a call, please contact Sniper Capital Limited at\ninfo@snipercapital.com\n.\nMACAU PROPERTY OPPORTUNITIES FUND LIMITED\nINTERIM REPORT FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024\nCHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE\nI present my Chairman's report for the first six months of the current financial year to 31st December 2024.\nWhile Macau's economy continues to demonstrate recovery driven by its two economic motors - gaming and tourism - the real estate market is subdued with conditions remaining challenging.

Notably, two villas at The Fountainside were sold, along with five additional units at The Waterside. These transactions brought total gross sales proceeds to c.US$93 million since the divestment programme began in mid-2022.

The two villas were sold on an individual basis after the Manager was unable to progress discussions with an en-bloc\nbuyer. Further details about the sales will be presented in the Company's forthcoming interim results.\nThree reconfigured apartments and two car-parking spaces now remain available for sale.

The broader residential market concluded the first three quarters of 2024 with a transaction volume of 2,496 units, representing a 6% year-on-year (YoY) increase.\nThe luxury residential market outperformed the overall market, with 163 sales involving apartments of more than 150 square metres recorded during the first three quarters of 2024, an overall increase of 38% YoY, albeit from a low base. However, the number of transactions began to decline between Q2 and Q3, with an overall 10% drop-in activity between the two quarters. The market also saw a 7% decline in the average transaction price over the same period and, despite a subsequent improvement in transaction volumes, prices continued on a downward trajectory to hit a nine-year low.\nDespite three interest rate cuts by the Monetary Authority of Macao in 2024, new approvals for bank loans to purchase residential and commercial properties saw declines, with residential mortgage approvals dropping by 57% month on month to October, suggesting that potential purchasers were still sitting on the sidelines.\nThe Chinese government has introduced a number of significant stimulus measures to support GDP growth and the country's real estate sector.

The Company, which is managed by Sniper Capital Limited, holds strategic property investments in Macau.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFund performance\n\u2022 MPO's portfolio value1 declined 8% over the year to US$152.7 million.\n\u2022 Adjusted NAV was US$ 66.1 million, which translates to US$1.07 (85 pence2) per share, a 26.9% decrease year-on-year (YoY).\n\u2022 IFRS NAV was US$46.4 million or US$0.75 (59 pence2) per share, a 29.4% decrease YoY.\nCapital management\n\u2022 As at 30 June 2024, MPO's balance sheet held assets worth a total of US$137.9 million, against combined liabilities of US$91.5 million.\n\u2022 The Company ended the financial year with a consolidated cash balance (including deposits with lenders) of US$4.8 million.\n\u2022 As at 30 June 2024, gross borrowings stood at US$82.8million, which translates to a loan-to-value ratio of 52.9%.\n1 Calculation was adjusted to reflect like-for-like comparisons to 30 June 2024 due to the divestment of properties during the year.\n2 Based on the Dollar/Sterling exchange rate of 1.265 on 30 June 2024.\nPORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS\n\u2022 The Waterside\n- 13 units were sold during the financial year comprising 11 standard units, one simplex unit and one duplex unit. A further 3 units were sold subsequent to the financial year end, leaving 29 units available for sale as at end of September.\n- Since the launch of The Waterside strata sales program in Q2 2022, the Company has achieved total divestments of US$77.7 million (HK$607million) through the sale of 27 units as at end June.\n- Tenant occupancy increased from 46% to 71% YoY as of year end, albeit with a lower base of number of available units for leasing.\n\u2022 The Fountainside\n- Two duplexes at the property have been reconfigured into three smaller units and two car-parking spaces. Occupancy permits are expected by the end of 2024 to early 2025, clearing the way for sales in Q1 2025.\n- For the four villas, marketing efforts continue with increased investor interest albeit pricing pressure remains.\n\u2022 Penha Heights\n- Since Macau's zero-COVID measures were lifted in early 2023, marketing activity for the property has been stepped up.\n- Events targeting high net worth individuals were hosted at the villa to showcase its potential.\nMark Huntley, Chairman of Macau Property Opportunities Fund, said:\n\"The sales achieved during the year enabled the Company's gross borrowings with banks to be reduced from US$105.6 million to US$82.8 million. With further sales completed after year-end, the Company's borrowings have fallen to US$68.9 million. The repayment of loans and the reduction of associated debt service levels has been a key objective during the year.\n\"We are mindful that sales velocity has been slower than we anticipated, but would stress that working within, rather than against, the market is the only means by which we can maximize returns in this environment.\n\"The effects of easing restrictions and reduced property taxes, lower interest rates and signs of further economic stimulus measures provide a more encouraging medium term outlook and a basis for market confidence and sentiment to improve. We will navigate through the near-term market challenges and continue looking for every opportunity to achieve our divestment objectives to repay debt and distribute capital back to our shareholders.\"\nFor more information, please visit http://www.mpofund.comfor the Company's full Annual Report 2024.\nThe Manager will be available to speak to analysts and the media.

All debt obligations due in the first half have been met. The Macau government's abolition of real estate anti-speculation measures has been met positively by industry players; however, this policy adjustment will take time to have a meaningful impact on the luxury residential property segment.\nPortfolio\nThe Waterside\nThe Company sold five units at The Waterside - four standard units and a duplex - during the period for a total gross value of US$15.4m. A total of 24 units among the tower's 59 units have now been sold since the divestment programme began, generating gross sales proceeds of approximately US$67.1 million. Sales of several other units are in early-stage negotiations.\nThe Company has applied 75% of the sales proceeds towards repaying a HK$75 million tranche that was due in March 2024, as well as other upcoming debt repayment obligations. The Company's outstanding debt is expected to be reduced from US$96.5 million as of December to US$79 million in July while loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is estimated to drop to approximately 47.4% using 31 March 2024 valuations.\nWith more than 40% of available units at The Waterside sold, the Company has terminated the leasing programme at the development as it focuses on divesting the remaining units. At the end of H1 2024, the occupancy rate at The Waterside stood at 65%, based on the building's leasable area.\nThe Fountainside\nAt The\nFountainside\n, four villas, three reconfigured apartments and two car-parking spaces remain available for sale. The three reconfigured apartments were modified from two original duplexes, and although the renovation was completed in 2022, Macau authorities requested additional alterations at a very late stage, following which additional on-site works began in late 2023 and were completed in Q1 2024. The alterations are currently under inspection by the authorities pending the issuance of occupancy permits. The Company is deploying numerous sales and marketing strategies to divest the remaining assets at The\nFountainside\n.\nPenha Heights\nPenha Heights, positioned atop the exclusive and historic Penha Hill, offers world-class views. While the number of inquiries and viewings increased in the first half of the year, they remain limited, and identifying the right buyer will take time given the property's high value and unique nature as a rare large, detached mansion in Macau. The Company has been exploring various marketing avenues, including hosting high-end events in collaboration with exclusive brands to showcase the property to ultra-high-net-worth individuals. The Manager will further enhance marketing efforts in the second half of the year to capitalise on an anticipated recovery in market sentiment.\nProperty\nIn April, Macau's government announced unprecedented property market relaxation measures that reversed its decade-old anti-speculation policies. These measures, which followed a similar move by the Hong Kong government in February, included removing prevailing special stamp duty requirements and improving the LTV ratio ceiling for mortgage loans for foreign buyers from approximately 40% to 70%. Among the prohibitive measures removed were:\n\u00b7\nStamp duty levied on properties resold within 24 months after purchase;\n\u00b7\nAn extra 10% duty imposed on foreign buyers;\n\u00b7\nA 5% extra duty on additional ownership.\nMacau's rollback of its anti-speculation measures has rekindled buyer interest in the local property market, with developers seizing the opportunity to offload inventory, albeit at generous discounts. In the secondary market, it is too early to see a rise in demand, as the focus is currently on developer inventory. However, we expect to see a near-term increase in interest among foreign buyers and a corresponding rise in transactions, with prices recovering over the longer term.\nMacau's overall residential property liquidity and price indices have trended downward since 2020. Although the number of transactions stabilised to 2,879 units in 2023 on a year on year (YoY) basis, it remained down by arou",

Despite this broadly positive backdrop, the property market - especially the higher-end luxury segment - was slower to respond as favourably as other areas of the economy, as a degree of caution remained. Accordingly, while progress with disposals was made during the year, the Board deemed it necessary to extend the management arrangements with Sniper whilst repositioning the fees payable to incentivise the Manager to achieve substantial sales during 2024. The Board's view remains unchanged that the Manager's knowledge of the Company's portfolio of assets and the Macau market is key to the successful delivery of the divestment strategy.\nThe Board has agreed to amend the terms of the Investment Management Agreement (the \"\nAgreement\n\") with the Manager, with effect (retrospectively) from 1 January 2024 as follows:\n\u00b7\nFrom 1 January 2024 and continuing during the remainder of calendar year 2024, a management fee of US$100,000 per month will continue to be payable to the Manager, with the realisation fee continuing on the same terms as in 2023 and using the 30 September 2019 valuation basis for determining the realisation fee hurdle.\n\u00b7\nFees continue to be subject to an overall cap per annum set at 4.99% of the lower of market capitalisation and net asset value (the \"\nCap\n\"). This is based on the market capitalisation on the day immediately prior to signing the amendment agreement in respect of calendar year 2024 and will be reset for each of the following years based on the market capitalisation or net asset value (as applicable) at close of business on the last business day of the previous calendar year. The Cap for 2024 is accordingly set at US$1,439,816.\n\u00b7\nAt the option of the Board, the monthly management fee may be reduced to US$80,000 per month in respect of any monthly period beginning on or after 1 January 2025, with one month's advance notice given to the Manager.\n\u00b7\nFor calendar year 2025 and thereafter, the realisation fee hurdle will be rebased by reference to the carrying value of the Company's portfolio of assets as at 31 December 2024 (if available), but subject to divestment hurdles being reached in 2024, in line with an agreed divestment plan.\n\u00b7\nFor calendar year 2025 and thereafter, the realisation fee will be 2.5% of the net realisation proceeds if the sale price achieved is greater than 90% of the carrying value, with the removal of the 80% - 90% performance hurdle band.\nThe Agreement (as amended) will continue throughout the divestment period, but with effect from 1 January 2025, the notice period to terminate the Agreement by each party will be reduced to 3 months.\nThe Board considers the arrangements to be fair given the context of the continued challenging property market seen during 2023. They are intended to ensure that the Manager is able to continue to operate and remains incentivised to deliver realisations on behalf of the Company and its shareholders. The changes to the fee arrangements constitute a smaller related party transaction under the Listing Rules, and the Company has obtained written confirmation from its Sponsor that the terms are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nThe Board would like to thank shareholders for their continued support and patience with regard to the Company's realisation strategy, and recognition of the inherent value in the Company's portfolio of assets.\nFor further information:\nManager\nSniper Capital Limited\nGroup Communications\nTel: +853 2870 5151\nEmail: info@snipercapital.com\nCorporate Broker\nLiberum Capital\nDarren Vickers\nTel: +44 20 3100 2222\nCompany Secretary & Administrator\nOcorian Administration (Guernsey) Limited\nKevin Smith\nTel: +44 14 8174 2742\n--Ends--\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nPremium listed on the London Stock Exchange, Macau Property Opportunities Fund Limited is a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's largest gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

These measures, which follow a similar move by Hong Kong in February, include the axing of prevailing special stamp duty requirements and improving loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratio ceilings for mortgage loans.\nUnder the proposed amendments, all\nexisting\nanti-speculation measures will be removed\n, i\nncluding:\no\nStamp duty levied on properties resold within 24 months after being purchased\no\nAn extra 10% duty imposed on\nforeign buyers\no\nAn 5% extra duty on additional ownership\nThe maximum mortgage LTV ratio ceiling for foreign buyers has also been increased from c.40% to 70%.\nThese policy changes are welcomed by the Company which is likely to benefit from an increase in interest for luxury residential properties which constitute the remainder of MPO's portfolio exposure.\nThe proposed policy amendments are subject to formal ratification by Macau's Legislative Assembly and are expected to become effective in the near future, following a fast-tracked approval process.\nDivestment Programme and Debt Position Update\nThe Company is also pleased to provide an update on its divestment progress and debt position, following the most recent information provided to shareholders in its Interim Results in early March.\nSince the end of 2023, MPO has successfully divested a further six units in The Waterside worth a combined gross value of HK$139.7 million\u00a0(c.US$17.9 million.) This brings the total number of units divested at The Waterside since the programme commenced to 24, raising a total of HK$525.0 million (US$67.1 million) in gross proceeds. 35 units remain available for sale.\nWhile negotiations are ongoing in an improving market, no further sales have as yet been secured at The Fountainside or Penha Heights.\nFollowing the completion of these latest divestments, the Company's total debt will fall to c. US$79.3 million from US$96.5 million, with its corresponding loan-to-value ratio declining to c.47% from c.51%.\nThe Manager continues to focus on securing further asset sales to reduce debt further and meet all the Company's financial obligations.\n-\u00a0End -\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nPremium listed on the London Stock Exchange,\nMacau Property Opportunities Fund Limited\nis a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's leading gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

To-date, 22 units, or 37.3% had been sold, with 37 units (62.7%) remaining available for sale. Gross proceeds in total amount to US$ 56.9m. Debt was reduced by US$ 9.6m in the period and further scheduled repayments will take place in Q1 2024.\n- As of the end of 2023, around 50% of\nThe Waterside\n's remaining apartments were occupied. Since the period end, this figure has increased to 60% and rental rates are improving.\n\u00b7\nThe Fountainside\n- Over 40 viewings took place, however no further sales were secured during the period. The Manager is maintaining a flexible and active marketing strategy for The Fountainside's four villas, targeting both individual unit and en bloc sales.\n- Reconfiguration of the two duplex units to create three smaller apartments and two car parks has been completed with final government inspections scheduled for the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nPenha Heights\n- Interest in the property picked up in 2023 after Macau's pandemic-related travel restrictions were lifted.\n- It will nevertheless take time to identify a buyer for the property, given its value and unique status as one of very few large, detached houses in Macau.\nMark Huntley, Chairman of Macau Property Opportunities Fund, said:\n\"Further disposals of units in\nThe Waterside\nunderscores our continued divestment of assets through a carefully managed process in market conditions which remain challenging. Debt levels are being reduced accordingly.\"\n\"For the first time in four years the Board was able to hold a meeting in Macau at the end of 2023. We saw at first-hand the territory's recovery through vibrant, dynamic gaming and hospitality sectors that we have reported previously.\nDespite this broadly positive backdrop, the property market - especially the higher-end luxury segment - has yet to respond as favourably as other areas of the Macau economy, as a degree of investor caution remains. Improved leasing of units in\nThe Waterside\nmay just be an earlier pointer to a strengthening market.\"\n\"The twin factors of a sluggish Chinese economy clearly experiencing major issues, including in its own real estate sector, coupled with higher interest rates, continue to affect investor appetite for high-end real estate and have also increased our ongoing debt service costs.\"\n\"In a welcome development, Macau's government announced a series of measures to provide relief to the property sector that came into effect in January 2024. These are fully explained in the Manager's Report and constitute a much-needed sign of support for the real estate market. It remains to be seen whether Macau will follow Hong Kong and introduce still further measures to support the property sector\".\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.mpofund.com\nfor the Company's full Interim Report 2024.\nThe Manager will be available to speak to analysts and the media.

Macau's economy, meanwhile, has continued to rebound following the lifting of COVID-related restrictions in early 2023, although its property market has remained sluggish. Looking forward, recently announced government measures to relax long-standing anti-speculation property restrictions from early 2024, may provide some support to the luxury residential segment.\nPortfolio\nThe Waterside\nSince the divestment programme was initiated in mid-2022, the Company has sold 19 units - around one in three of the tower's 59 units -\ngenerating gross revenues of c.US$52 million\n. Of the net proceeds, 75% has been deployed to pay down the Company's debt, while the balance has been made available for working capital. During H2 2023, the Company made loan repayments of HK$60 million (approximately US$7.7 million). A further debt repayment tranche of HK$75 million is scheduled for the end of Q1 2024, which the company is aiming to meet through its ongoing divestment programme.\nAt the end of 2023, the occupancy rate at\nThe Waterside\nwas 50%, based on the gross floor area of the unsold units.\nThe Fountainside\nAt\nThe Fountainside\n, four villas, three reconfigured apartments and two car-parking spaces remain available for sale. The Company is deploying several active sales and marketing strategies to divest these assets.\nThe three reconfigured apartments being modified from two original duplexes have been the subject of requests for additional alterations at a very late stage by Macau authorities. Upon receiving the construction licence, on-site works began at the end of November, and are expected to be completed imminently. An application for the occupancy permits will be made once the works are completed.\nPenha Heights\nPotential buyers' interest in\nPenha Heights\nhas picked up since Macau's pandemic-era travel restrictions were lifted. The number of inquiries and viewings has increased, but it will take time to identify a buyer, given the value and unique nature of the property, one of very few large, detached houses in Macau. The Company will thus explore a variety of new marketing opportunities.\nCaption: Living and dining area of a duplex unit at the Waterside\nProperty\nMacau's property sector has remained sluggish due to higher interest rates and the uneven progress of the territory's economic recovery following the worst of the COVID pandemic. Economic headwinds both globally and in mainland China have also weighed on investor sentiment.\nIn the residential property segment overall, 2,354 transactions were recorded during the first three quarters of 2023, a year-on-year (YoY) improvement of 9% from a 40-year low in 2022. Prices appeared to have stabilised at HK$5,721 per square foot in Q3 2023, 1% lower than in Q3 2022. In the luxury residential segment, comprising units larger than 150 square metres, only 118 units were transacted during the first three quarters of the year, an increase of 13% YoY, while average prices in Q3 2023 declined 10% YoY.\nSentiment in the luxury segment, however, received a potential boost when Macau's government announced several measures late in Q4 to rekindle interest in property by rolling back some anti-speculation policies from January 2024. It has abolished a 5% stamp duty for transactions involving second homes, and purchasers of properties valued at MOP8 million (c.US$1 million) or more can now enjoy 70% ceilings on mortgage loan-to-value ratios, up from 50% previously.\nAmid signs of stabilisation of mainland China's property sector, ongoing efforts to stimulate the Chinese economy, and the relaxation of Macau's anti-speculation measures, the Company is cautiously optimistic that investor sentiment towards luxury residential properties in the territory will gradually improve.\nMacau\nEconomy\nMacau registered robust gross domestic product growth of 78% YoY during the first three quarters of 2023, and full-year 2023 growth is expected to be 75% YoY. GDP growth has been driven mainly by the recovery of the territory's twin economic engin",

The Company, which is managed by Sniper Capital Limited, holds strategic property investments in Macau.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFund performance\n\u00b7\nMPO's portfolio value1 declined 1% over the year to US$200.5 million.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted NAV was US$ 90.4 million, which translates to US$1.46 (116 pence2) per share, a 12.6% decrease year-on-year (YoY).\n\u00b7\nIFRS NAV was US$65.7 million or US$1.06 (84 pence2) per share, a 15.3% decrease YoY.\nCapital management\n\u00b7\nAs at 30 June 2023, MPO's balance sheet held assets worth a total of US$182.6 million, against combined liabilities of US$116.9 million.\n\u00b7\nThe Company ended the financial year with a consolidated cash balance (including deposits with lenders) of US$6.7 million.\n\u00b7\nAs at 30 June 2023, gross borrowings stood at US$105.6 million, which translates to a loan-to-value ratio of 50.9%.\n1\nCalculation was adjusted to reflect like-for-like comparisons to 30 June 2023 due to the divestment of properties during the year.\n2\nBased on the Dollar/Sterling exchange rate of 1.261 on 30 June 2023.\nPORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nThe Waterside\n-\nSince the launch of The Waterside strata sales programme in Q2 2022, the Company\nhas achieved total divestments of US$44.3 million (HK$348 million) through the sale of 16 units.\n-\nThe units were sold at an average value of 65% above cost, and an average 8% discount to their latest average valuations.\n-\nThe completion of 13 units occurred during the period under review. Of the\nthree further sales of units, two have settled and one completion is scheduled for early October.\n-\nTenant occupancy increased by 19% YoY to 46%.\n-\nThe average rental remains at US$2.2 per square foot per month.\n\u00b7\nThe Fountainside\n-\nTwo duplexes at the property have been reconfigured into three smaller units and two car-parking spaces. Occupancy permits are expected by the end of 2023, clearing the way for sales.\n-\nFor the four villas, marketing efforts are expected to increase investor interest as we enter 2024.\n\u00b7\nPenha Heights\n-\nDuring the period under review, Macau's zero-COVID measures disrupted on-site viewings and weighed on investor sentiment.\n-\nSince Macau's zero-COVID measures were lifted in early 2023, marketing activity for the property has been stepped up.\nMark Huntley, Chairman of Macau Property Opportunities Fund, said:\n\"The financial year can be separated into two distinct periods. During the first six months, Macau was subject to strict dynamic zero-COVID regulations, in lockstep with mainland China. At the beginning of 2023, however, COVID controls were rapidly relaxed, triggering a dramatic economic recovery which has seen both strong growth in gross gaming revenues and significantly increased numbers of visitors to Macau.\nThe strata sales programme of selected apartments in the Waterside is delivering results and has produced US$44.3 million of sale proceeds which has reduced our overall level of debt from US$131 million to US$105 million in the last financial year. The environment in which we operate has remained difficult; concerns have surfaced regarding China's economic performance and inflationary pressures have driven global interest rates higher.

The property sector, however, has so far lagged the overall economy at this relatively early stage of the recovery and challenges including high interest rates and a slow return of confidence have persisted. Against this backdrop, the Company continued to advance its divestment programme during the period, selling an additional nine units at\nThe Waterside\n.\nPortfolio\nThe lifting of travel restrictions to and from Macau just six months ago has been extremely positive for the territory's tourism industry, but the immediate impact on the ultra-luxury segment of its residential property market and the Company's portfolio has so far been muted.\nThe Waterside\nThe Company's strata sales programme at\nThe Waterside\nhas made further progress, with the disposal of three additional units since the last update to Shareholders in the Company's Interim Report, issued in February. The disposals bring total year-to-date sales at the property to nine standard units. Overall, 14 of the development's 59 apartments have so far been sold through the strata sales programme.\nThe combined value of year-to-date sales at\nThe Waterside\nis approximately US$22.3 million, with 80% of the apartments sold being standard units located on low to middle floors. Units located on more valuable higher floors, including the special simplex and duplex units, have been reserved for future sales as Macau's property market improves.\nIn line with the recovery in Macau's tourism industry, leasing demand at\nThe Waterside\nis showing continued signs of improvement. Occupancy currently stands at 47%, up from 32% at the end of 2022, driven by a 22% increase in new leases since last December and an 11% reduction in the number of units available for lease during the same period. Rental income has also increased since December, up 22%, while the average rent remains unchanged at US$2.17 per square foot, despite average rentals in the immediate area around\nThe Waterside\ndropping 8.3% year on year (YoY) in Q1.\nSecuring further sales at\nThe Waterside\nremains a priority. The Company is therefore balancing increased rental income from current leasing demand with further strata sales of vacant units. Sales of units with sitting tenants are a component of our strategy, bringing our leasing and sales approaches into alignment.\nThe Company intends to progress the strata sales programme but pace this to take advantage of the expected property market recovery.\nThe Fountainside\nAt\nThe Fountainside\n, four villas, three reconfigured units and two car-parking spaces remain available for sale. A few potential purchasers have viewed the villas and negotiations remain ongoing, a reflection of the current state of the luxury segment of Macau's property market, which has faced ongoing challenges despite the territory's economic recovery. Nevertheless, in anticipation of increased market activity in the coming months, a renewed marketing campaign is currently in progress for the villas.\nThe\nissuance of\noccupancy permits for the three smaller reconfigured units has been delayed. The authorities completed inspections in January and comments detailing minor changes have been received. The permits are now expected to be issued in Q3, following which the marketing of the three units will commence.\nPenha Heights\nInterest in\nPenha Heights\nhas been muted, consistent with the lack of activity in Macau's ultra-luxury property segment. Although several viewings have taken place in the past six months, a sustained economic recovery in both Macau and mainland China is a prerequisite for investor interest in an asset such as\nPenha Heights -\na fact that is likely to become more apparent entering 2024. In the meantime, maintenance work has been ongoing to keep the property in pristine condition and a very targeted marketing campaign is planned for the second half of the year.\nProperty\nProperty sector expected to lag economic recovery\nMacau's property market has so far lagged the impressive tourism industry recovery. The market faces a number of challenges, including a high interest rate environment that has seen the territory's base lending rate",

The Company, which is managed by Sniper Capital Limited, holds strategic property investments in\u00a0Macau.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFund performance\n\u00b7\nMPO's portfolio value\n1\nwas\u00a0US$224.9 million\u00a0as at 31 December 2022, an increase of 1.4% over the six-month period.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted Net Asset Value (NAV) was\u00a0US$99.5million, which translates to\u00a0US$1.61\u00a0(133 pence\n2\n) per share, a decline of 3.8% over the period.\n\u00b7\nIFRS NAV was\u00a0US$73.6 million\u00a0as at the period end, equating to\u00a0US$1.19\u00a0(98 pence\n2\n) per share, a drop of 5.1%.\nCapital management\n\u00b7\nThe aggregated cash and deposit balances were\u00a0US$2.3 million, of which\u00a0US$1.9 million\u00a0was pledged as collateral for credit facilities.\n\u00b7\nGross borrowings stood at\u00a0US$117.2 million, equating to a loan-to-value ratio of 51.6%.\n\u00b7\nDebt repayment of\u00a0US$14 million\u00a0was achieved during the period.\nExtension of Company life\n\u00b7\nAt the Company's Annual General Meeting in December, shareholders agreed to a further extension of the Company's life until 31 December 2023.\n[1]\nCalculation was adjusted to reflect\nlike-for-like comparisons to 31 December 2022 due to the divestment of properties during the period.\n[2]\nBased on the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate of 1.210 on 31 December 2022.\nPORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nThe Waterside\n- Challenging market conditions hindered the Company's strata sales programme, with the sale of only one unit completed during the six month period.\n- Since the period end, MPO has entered into contracts for the sale of six further units for a combined consideration of US$14.6 million. This brings the total units sold to date in\nThe Waterside\nto eleven.\n- Two of these six latest transactions have now completed in full and security deposits have been received for the remaining four properties, with completions due over the next three months.\n- As of the end of 2022, around 32% of\nThe Waterside\n's apartments were occupied and the average rent stood at\u00a0US$2.2\u00a0per square foot per month. The occupancy rate has subsequently risen to 37% as of the date of this release.\n\u00b7\nThe Fountainside\n- No further sales were secured during the period. The Manager is maintaining a flexible marketing strategy for The Fountainside's four villas, targeting both individual unit and en bloc sales.\n- Reconfiguration of the two duplex units to create three smaller apartments and two car parks has been completed with government inspections conducted in January 2023. Government approval is expected in Q2 2023.\n\u00b7\nPenha Heights\n- Marketing this trophy home has been challenging as in-person viewings were made difficult by travel restrictions until the new year.\n- Ongoing viewings are taking place and the manager will continue to work with specialist agents to explore all possible channels for an optimal exit from the asset.\nMark Huntley, Chairman of Macau Property Opportunities Fund, said:\n\"Throughout the period, our divestment process continued against a very difficult backdrop, with a consistent focus on marketing more units at The Waterside. We have maintained a pragmatic, measured approach to market conditions, balancing our need for debt reduction and working capital with the market's emerging upside potential.\n\"The dramatic effects of the easing of COVID-related restrictions can only benefit the outlook for Macau, leading to a more supportive environment for the Company as it pursues its divestment strategy.\"\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.mpofund.com\nfor the Company's full Interim Report 2023.\nThe Manager will be available to speak to analysts and the media.

The divestment of all remaining assets continues to be the highest priority of the Company and the Manager is exploring all possible options to divest the assets for the benefit of shareholders. The Board's view remains unchanged that the Manager's knowledge of the Company's portfolio of assets and the Macau market is key to the successful delivery of the divestment strategy. The Board welcomes the recent abandonment of the Chinese government's zero-COVID strategy and is hopeful that as the market continues to open that the possibility for significant further disposals will increase.\nAgainst this challenging backdrop, the Board has agreed to roll the terms of the Investment Management Agreement (the \"\nAgreement\n\") with the Manager, with effect (retrospectively) from 1 January 2023. Accordingly, a management fee of US$100,000 per calendar month for the calendar year 2023 will continue to be payable. Realisation fees will continue on the same terms as in 2022 (using the 30 September 2019 valuation basis for calculating any realisation fees due) with all fees payable under the Agreement subject to an overall cap of US$1,780,000.\nThe Board considers the arrangements to be fair given the context of the impact of the zero-COVID policy seen during 2022. They are intended to ensure that the Manager is able to continue to operate and remains incentivised to deliver realisations on behalf of the Company and its shareholders. The changes to the fee arrangements constitute a smaller related party transaction under the Listing Rules, and the Company has obtained written confirmation from its Sponsor that the terms are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nThe Board would like to thank shareholders for their continued support and patience with regard to the Company's realisation strategy, and recognition of the inherent value in the Company's portfolio of assets.\nFor further information:\nManager\nSniper Capital Limited\nGroup Communications\nTel: +65 6222 1440\nEmail: info@snipercapital.com\nCorporate Broker\nLiberum Capital\nDarren Vickers / Owen Matthews\nTel: +44 20 3100 2222\nCompany Secretary & Administrator\nOcorian Administration (Guernsey) Limited\nKevin Smith\nTel: +44 14 8174 2742\n--Ends--\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nPremium listed on the London Stock Exchange, Macau Property Opportunities Fund Limited is a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's largest gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau.

The rapid reversal of that policy i\nn December - although ultimately positive for Macau - is likely to continue to hinder the near-term progress of the Company's divestment programme due to the ensuing \"exit-wave\" of COVID infections sweeping across the region.\nPortfolio\nThe economic downturn and zero-COVID restrictions over the past six months prompted the Company to carefully adjust its divestment strategy. This led to negotiations for all three portfolio properties, although successful sales were concluded only at\nThe Waterside\n.\nThe complete reversal of China and Macau's zero-COVID policy in December, is far reaching and comes as a long-awaited, positive development. Most significantly, it reinstates free access across the region, including Hong Kong. However, a positive impact on Macau's property market is unlikely to be immediate, and the Company is adopting a cautious position as the rapid spread of COVID following the lifting of restrictions may complicate the near-term divestment programme.\nThe Waterside\nThe Company's strata sales programme at\nThe Waterside\nmade slow progress in the second half, with the sale of only one additional unit, bringing the total sold in 2022 to five out of the 59 apartments in the building. The total combined sales value of the units was approximately US$17 million, equating to a discount of 6% to their average valuations as of 30 June 2022.\nFrom the US$17 million sales proceeds, the Company utilised US$14 million for loan repayments and earmarked the balance for working capital.\nThe Waterside\n's lender extended new financing of US$6.4 million partly to refinance an US$18.3 million repayment that was due for settlement in September, resulting in an improvement of the overall portfolio loan-to-value (LTV) ratio from 53.3% in June to its current 51.5%.\nSecuring further sales remains the Company's overriding priority at\nThe Waterside\n, but this is being balanced with its ongoing leasing programme. Tenant demand showed signs of improvement in December, with the occupancy rate increasing marginally to 32% at an average rent of HK$17.06 per square foot, largely unchanged from H1 2022. The Company has received interest in unit purchases in the building from some long-term tenants.\nThe Fountainside\nAt\nThe Fountainside\n, four villas and two duplexes that have been reconfigured into three smaller units and two additional car-parking spaces, remain available for sale. The reconfiguration work was completed in Q3, but the occupancy permits have been delayed by several months due to Macau's protracted approvals process and the local COVID situation. The permits are now expected to be issued by Q2 2023, following which the marketing of the three units will commence.\nAlthough several buyers from Macau and Hong Kong have been identified, negotiations stalled as investor sentiment waned following a COVID lockdown in Macau in July and amid restrictions on access to the territory from China, which have now been lifted.\nPenha Heights\nMarketing Penha Heights to potential purchasers has been challenging, as viewings are an important step in the acquisition of this type of luxury property. Demand for the asset remains strongest from China where travel restrictions have discouraged interested parties from actively viewing the property. The more recent resumption of the free movement of people in the region and a likely rebound in sentiment once the current COVID surge abates should positively impact progress on a sale moving forward.\nProperty\nResidential property sector hits new lows\nImpacted by weak investor sentiment, Macau's residential property sector continued to struggle in H2 2022. Following Macau's citywide lockdown in July, the city's property market did not recover as expected, resulting in Q3 transaction volumes declining by 32% quarter on quarter (QoQ), or 65% year on year (YoY) to 541 transactions - a new low for the residential market. Average prices declined 3.1% QoQ to HKD8,267 (US$1,061) per square fo",

The AGM will take place on 13 December 2022 at 10.00 a.m. (GMT) 6.00 p.m. (HKT).\nAn electronic copy of the AGM and Chairman's Letter is available at the Company's website at\nhttps://mpofund.com/investors/publications/shareholder-documents/\n.\nIn addition to the ordinary business being proposed at the AGM, a resolution will be put to shareholders to continue the life of the Company (the \"Continuation Resolution\") in accordance with the obligation set out in the circular dated 8 June 2018.\nDuring 2022, the divestment strategy for the Company's luxury residential tower,\nThe Waterside\n, was expanded to include strata sales, which to-date has led to the successful divestment of five units valued at approximately US$17 million.\nThe average transaction price of the 5 units was at a 6% discount to the average valuation of the Waterside as at 30 June 2022 but represented a 74% increase against costs.\nMore recently, a new sales programme featuring an additional five units has been launched, generating positive initial feedback among potential buyers. The Company will aim to progress its divestment programme for all its remaining assets throughout 2023, taking into account market conditions and investor demand.\nIt is likely that returns from sales of properties would be significantly lower if the Company was forced to sell as a result of discontinuation. It is the Board's view that it is therefore commercially sensible for the Company to continue.\nThe Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Continuation Resolution in order to allow the opportunity to dispose of the remaining Company assets in an orderly way.\nNotes\nA copy of the Notice and the Form of Proxy has also been filed at the National Storage Mechanism web-site at\nhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism\n.\nAbout Macau Property Opportunities Fund\nPremium listed on the London Stock Exchange, Macau Property Opportunities Fund Limited is a closed-end investment company registered in Guernsey and is the only quoted property fund dedicated to investing in Macau, the world's largest gaming market and the only city in China where gaming is legalised.\nLaunched in 2006, the Company targets strategic property investment and development opportunities in Macau. Its current portfolio comprises prime residential property assets.\nThe Company is managed by Sniper Capital Limited, an Asia based property investment manager with an established track record in fund management and investment advisory.\nStock Code\nLondon Stock Exchange: MPO\nLEI\n213800NOAO11OWIMLR72\nFor further information:\nInvestor Relations\nSniper Capital Limited\nTel: +853 2870 5151\ninfo@snipercapital.com\nwww.snipercapital.com\nCorporate Broker\nLiberum Capital\nDarren Vickers / Owen Matthews\nTel: +44 20 3100 2000\nCompany Secretary & Administrator\nOcorian Administration (Guernsey) Limited\nKevin Smith\nTel: +44 14 8174 2742\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

Another residential project, The Fountainside, was marked up 54 per cent thanks to progress on development and pre-sales. The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

Another residential project, The Fountainside, was marked up 54 per cent thanks to progress on development and pre-sales. The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

Another residential project, The Fountainside, was marked up 54 per cent thanks to progress on development and pre-sales. The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

Another residential project, The Fountainside, was marked up 54 per cent thanks to progress on development and pre-sales. The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

Astonishingly, however, the Far Eastern developer has grown so fast that even at 212p the shares remain clearly undervalued. At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent).

          "content": "But - as the inefficacy of previous cooling measures shows - it is impossible for the government to address the underlying problem: rapid growth on an island market where supply is radically constrained by geography. In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

          "content": "And that was one of the more modest revaluation figures in Macau's annual results. Another residential project, The Fountainside, was marked up 54 per cent thanks to progress on development and pre-sales. The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

Astonishingly, however, the Far Eastern developer has grown so fast that even at 212p the shares remain clearly undervalued. At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

Another residential project, The Fountainside, was marked up 54 per cent thanks to progress on development and pre-sales. The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",

In the first half of 2013, Macau's economy grew by 11 per cent year on year to $10.6bn. Revenues in the gaming sector - the backbone of this economy - were up nearly 17 per cent. Retail sales rose 20 per cent by value. The government reckons the island's population will have to expand by 20 per cent over the coming three years to support this economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrucially, however, investors don't even need to believe in this admittedly distant growth story to find Macau Property\u2019s stock attractive. The valuation case alone is compelling enough. In August Macau Property agreed to sell its two assets in Zhuhai, just across from Macau on mainland China, for $64m - a 42 per cent premium to their latest book value. When this deal completes early next year, it will crystallise a one-off gain of 13p, which broker Liberum Capital expects to be distributed as a dividend, which would be equivalent to a yield of over 6 per cent.",

Another residential project, The Fountainside, was marked up 54 per cent thanks to progress on development and pre-sales. The Green House, an unusual detached home the company bought in 2007, rose 32 per cent to $16m even though Macau Property did nothing to it. Even Senado Square, a retail redevelopment project that has been held up by planning, increased 16 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe sheer strength of such numbers inevitably calls into question their sustainability. The Macau property market has been roaring since 2010, despite various attempts by the government to cool it. The latest measures, introduced in July, include compulsory licensing of estate agents and a new checklist of requirements for off-plan sales. The latter has delayed Macau Property's exit strategy for The Fountainside - though the developer still expects to obtain the permit necessary to sell the remaining 20 flats by the end of the year",

At the end of September, the company's book value stood at 413\u00a2 or 251p per share.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown thanks partly to strong portfolio revaluations, partly to share buy-backs. By far the fund's largest asset is The Waterside, a block of luxury rental flats for expat executives launched in 2010. Macau Property has been aggressively increasing rents to maximise the asset valuation. Over the 12 months to 30 June the average rent per square foot rose by 9 per cent, even as occupancy leapt from 75 per cent to 94 per cent (though it has since fallen back to 88 per cent). The portfolio valuation, which is conducted by the local branch of brokerage Savills, consequently rose 23 per cent to $221m.",
