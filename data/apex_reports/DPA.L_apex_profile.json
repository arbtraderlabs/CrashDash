As a result, the Group's UK subsidiary intends to exercise its right to cancel any extension of its existing lease arrangements with Thai Airways (\"Thai\") beyond the existing scheduled lease term which ends in 2026.\nBackground\nIn April 2022, a Letter of Intent with Thai was signed to amend the existing lease terms. Under the revised terms, the lease was structured as a power-by-the-hour arrangement until 31 December 2022, followed by fixed monthly lease payments thereafter until October 2026 for aircraft MSN 36110 and December 2026 for aircraft MSN 35320.\nThe leases also contained possible extensions for an additional three years to October and December 2029, at reduced monthly payments starting in November 2026 and January 2027\n.\nHowever, with the consent of the Lenders, an option was retained to early-terminate the extended leases with effect from October and December 2026 without any extension.\nNew Lease Agreements\nFollowing an extended period of negotiation, the Group is pleased to announce that its New Subsidiaries have entered into new lease agreements with LOT, Poland's state-owned airline, for its two Boeing 787-8 aircraft. The leases each have a 12-year term, commencing on 29 October 2026 (MSN 36110) and 9 December 2026 (MSN 35320).\nLease rental payments are structured over the 12-year term, with a fixed monthly rate for the first eight years, followed by a reduced fixed monthly rate for the final four years, providing rental payments of approximately US$168m in aggregate over the full term.\nAs a result of entering into these new agreements, the Group's UK subsidiary will shortly confirm to Thai its intention to exercise its right to cancel any extension of the existing leases beyond 2026. Under the terms of the current lease, Thai will be required to return the aircraft in full-life condition at the end of the respective lease periods in October and December 2026.\nLOT Polish Airlines\nLOT Polish Airlines is Poland's flag carrier and one of the world's oldest airlines still in operation. LOT is wholly owned by Polish Aviation Group, a Polish state-owned holding company and is a member of the International Air Transport Association.\nBased at Warsaw Chopin Airport, LOT operates an extensive network, connecting passengers to approximately 100 destinations across Europe, Asia, and North America. In 2024, LOT achieved a record-breaking year by transporting over 10 million passengers, operating 107,926 flights, and covering a total of 148 million kilometres. As of August 2024, the airline's fleet comprised 80 aircraft, making it the 18th largest operator in Europe.\nLOT is a member of the Star Alliance, having joined in October 2003, which allows it to offer passengers a wide range of global connections. The airline also has codeshare agreements with various carriers, including Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, and Singapore Airlines, further expanding its network.\nThroughout its history, LOT has been recognized for its service quality, receiving accolades such as the \"Business Traveller\" award for the Best Eastern European Airline multiple times.\nDebt Financing Position\nThe existing debt financing arrangements with the current lenders are set to expire in October and December 2026, coinciding with the expiration of the Thai leases. The Group is actively exploring all refinancing options, including potential agreements with new lenders, and has already received several indicative proposals.\nThe Board will be evaluating these proposals as a top priority in the coming weeks.\nAs at 28 February 2025, the Group had approximately US$81.24 million in outstanding debt. The total outstanding debt at loan maturity on 31 December 2026 is expected to be US$70 million.\nAircraft Valuati",

The Board has now determined to proceed with a fundraising through the issue of new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"\nNew Ordinary Shares\n\") by way of tap issuance (the \"\nTap\nIssue\n\").\nThe Tap Issue will provide for the issue of up to 16,666,667 New Ordinary Shares at a price of US$0.06 per Share, thereby raising gross proceeds of up to US$1 million. The Tap Issue is being undertaken at a price which represents a significant discount to the Company's unaudited NAV per Ordinary Share, which was US$0.18751 as at 30 June 2024. At the Company's most recent Annual General Meeting, held on 19 September 2023, authority was granted by shareholders for the issue of up to 47,866,666 Ordinary Shares at a price which is less than the prevailing NAV per Ordinary Share.\nThe Tap Issue will be launched immediately following this announcement. To register their interest in participating in the Tap Issue, potential investors should communicate their\napplications\nfor New Ordinary Shares to their usual contact at Investec. The Tap Issue is expected to close at 10.00 a.m. (London time) on Friday, 15 November 2024 but may close earlier or later at the discretion of the Company and Investec.\nThe Tap Issue will be made to qualified investors\n(as defined in Article 2(e) of the UK version of the Prospectus Regulation (EU 2017/1129) which forms part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended), and will be subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement.\nAllocations of New Ordinary Shares\nThe number of New Ordinary Shares to be issued will be agreed between Investec and the Company following the close of the Tap Issue and announced shortly thereafter. In the event that applications from investors in aggregate exceed the number of New Ordinary Shares available under the Tap Issue, it is expected that precedence will be given to applications from shareholders on the Company's share register as at close of business on 31 October 2024. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Investec may choose to accept applications, either in whole or in part, on the basis of allocations determined in agreement with the Company, and may scale down any applications for this purpose on such basis as the Company and Investec may determine.\nApplication for Admission\nApplication will be made for admission of the New Ordinary Shares to trading on the Specialist Fund Segment of the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities (the\n\"SFS\"\n) (\"\nAdmission\"\n). It is expected that Admission will become effective, and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares on the SFS will commence, on\nTuesday, 19 November 2024\n.\nExpected Timetable\nLatest time and date for receipt of applications\n10.00 a.m. on Friday, 15 November 2024\nAnnouncement of results of the Tap Issue\nFriday, 15 November 2024\nNew Ordinary Shares issued to successful applicants on a T+2 basis\nFriday, 15 November 2024\nAdmission and commencement of dealings in New Ordinary Shares\n8.00 a.m. on Tuesday, 19 November 2024\nInformation about the Company\nThai Airways Leases\nThe Company's two aircraft are now operating on fixed monthly lease payments with Thai Airways (\"Thai\") until October/December 2026 respectively. As previously noted, the lease terms were extended by a further three years to October/December 2029, with further scaled back monthly lease payments starting from November 2026/January 2027. The Company retains a right of early termination regarding this three year extension after consultation with the Company's lending banks (the \"Lenders\").\nAs the lease agreements currently stand, Thai are required to return the aircraft at the end of the lease terms in full life condition, which would incur significant costs for Thai.\nThe Company is now in discussions with Thai regarding proposals to amend the",

The lease rental income generated under the PbH period by the Company's aircraft exceeded expectations. Ongoing costs and interest on scheduled and deferred loan amounts were paid when due, with the effect that an increase in the debt burden was avoided, and a cash reserve was instead built up. The PbH period negotiated between the Company and THAI ended, as agreed, on 31 December 2022 and is now being replaced with new fixed lease rentals of USD 510k per aircraft per month for the remaining lease period.\nUnder the debt arrangements in place between the Company and its lending banks, modified terms and conditions for the total loan amount outstanding as at 31 December 2022 have to be negotiated for the period commencing 1 January 2023 until loan maturity in December 2026. The Company has now negotiated revised terms with its lenders, including the postponement of certain principal payments, to align the respective loan agreements with the terms of the amended lease agreements with THAI.\nIn a Second Amendment and Restatement to the Loan Agreement signed on 7 February 2023, the parties agreed on the following main terms:\n\u00b7\nthe total loan amount outstanding of USD 97.9m will be split into two tranches:\no\nTranche 1 of USD 62.4m (amortizing to a balloon\u00a0which is dependent on the fixed interest rate and still\u00a0has to be determined) represents the scheduled debt\no\nTranche 2 of USD 35.5m (non-amortizing) represents the deferred debt\n\u00b7\nUSD 2.36m of surplus cash generated under the PbH period will be used to repay debt on the amortizing Tranche 1, while an agreed cash reserve of USD 500k per aircraft will be retained to cover unforeseen costs going forward\n\u00b7\nthe interest rate swap currently in place for the scheduled debt will be dissolved at no net gain or loss\n\u00b7\nTranche 1 and Tranche 2 will each bear fixed interest rates to establish reliable and transparent payment schedules and to eliminate the risk of increasing interest rates. Further details will be provided once both have been fixed\n\u00b7\nfrom the monthly lease rental of USD 510k/aircraft, USD 35k per aircraft will be retained by the Company to contribute to ongoing fixed costs\nDue to the limited liquidity position of the Company, the lenders have refrained at this stage from charging the restructuring fees which are typically associated with the process; instead the lenders will be paid a fee after the eventual remarketing of the aircraft, subject to surplus sales proceeds being realized.\nFor further information, please contact:\nAztec Financial Services (Guernsey) Limited +44(0) 1481 748833\nSarah Felmingham / Chris Copperwaite\nInvestec Bank plc +44(0) 20 7597 4000\nDavid Yovichic/Denis Flanagan\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
