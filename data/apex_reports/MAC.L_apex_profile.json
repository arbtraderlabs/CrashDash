However, the market started to pick up in November 2025, and there has been a healthy new business pipeline developing in recent months.\nDuring the six months ended 31 October 2025, the Company generated a gross profit of \u00a355,310 (2024: \u00a3103,468) and delivered an operating loss of \u00a3177,066 (2024: loss of \u00a3138,485 ), resulting in an overall loss before tax of \u00a3176,515 (2024: loss of \u00a3178,261).\nThe Company\u2019s balance sheet shows a net asset value of \u00a33,063,198 (2024: \u00a33,183,537), representing 2.56p (2024: 3.01p) of value per share in issue. The Board remains positive about the investments that it holds in its client companies, and in particular its core investment in Weardale Lithium.\nWhilst there have been delays in completing some advisory projects during the Period, on a positive note, Marechale has in the last few months completed both debt and equity growth round transactions for Wright Brothers, the UK\u2019s leading premium fish wholesaler and restaurant operator, KBH, one of the UK\u2019s leading \u2018out of home\u2019 media companies on the UK\u2019s railways and cinemas, Weardale Lithium, which has received planning for the UK\u2019s first Direct Lithium Extraction plant and Chestnut Inns, one of the UK\u2019s leading premium inn operators.\nCash at bank as at 31 October 2025 was \u00a3228,593 (2024: \u00a3223,700). However, in the months since the end of the Period, and based on the recent transactions that Marechale has completed, the Company has grown its cash at bank to \u00a3312,000 as at 14 January 2026.\nThe Board is working on a number of initiatives to create further value for shareholders over and above its core investment portfolio and corporate finance projects, including working with various potential businesses and individuals.\nThis plan to continue to develop Marechale\u2019s strategic partnerships in order to enhance shareholder value, and develop new funding partners alongside its traditional investor relationships, has culminated in the successful completion of a placing in Marechale shares in October (as previously announced); this brought in two new strategic investors as well, in addition to all the Company\u2019s directors investing too.\nMarechale Capital continues to see interesting corporate finance and advisory projects; the Board believes despite the challenges of the last few years, that the SME market is looking more positive, and that there is a recognition of value in UK growth companies, particularly with new initiatives for the AIM markets, the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), and the move to encourage more private and institutional funding into smaller UK companies.\nWhilst the current economic climate is difficult, Marechale Capital remains diligent and is convinced that there will continue to be good advisory and investment opportunities in its core hospitality, renewable, clean energy and technology sectors over the short to medium term, where the Company can generate more value enhancing warrant and founding equity holdings alongside advisory cash fees. The Board is also hoping to agree terms on further strategic partnerships, and is in a number of advanced conversations with different parties.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\nJo Turner / Sandy Jamieson\nTel: +44 (0)20\n7213 0880\nIncome Statement (unaudited)\n6 months ended 31 October\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n111,932\n148,500\nCost of sales\n(56,622)\n(45,032)\nGross profit\n55,310\n103,468\nAdministrative expenses\n(232,376)\n(241,953)\nOperating loss\n(177,066)\n(138,485)\nExceptional credit\n600\n10,316\nLoss on disposal of investments\n-\n(49,837)\nInterest paid\n(49)\n(255)\n(Loss) before tax\n(176,515)\n(178,261)\nTaxation\n-\n-\n(Loss) after tax\n(176,515)\n(178,261)\n(Loss) per share\n(Pence)\n(Pence)\n- Basic\n(0.17)\n(0.17)\n- Diluted\n(0.17)\n(0.17)\nBalance Sheet (unaudited)\nAs at\n31 October\n31 October\n2025\n2024\nCurrent assets\nAvailable for sale investments\n2,807,829\n2,939,660\nTrading investments\n58,800\n49,953\nTrade and other receivables\n91,172\n52,856\nCash and cash equivalents\n228,593\n223,712\n3,186,394\n3,266,181\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\nPAYE\nBounce-back Loan\n(110,811)\n(4,885)\n(7,500)\n(54,338)\n(10,806)\n(10,000)\nTotal current liabilities\n(123,196)\n(75,144)\nNet current assets\n3,063,198\n3,191,037\nBounce-back Loan \u2013 long-term\n-\n(7,500)\nNet assets\n3,063,198\n3,183,537\nEquity\nCapital and reserves attributable to equity shareholders\nShare capital\nShare premium\n955,530\n575,790\n847,530\n481,290\nReserve for own shares\n(50,254)\n(50,254)\nRetained profits/ (losses)\n1,403,817\n1,739,397\nReserve for share based payments\n178,315\n165,574\n3,063,198\n3,183,537\nCash Flow Statement (unaudited)\n6 months ended\n31 October\n31 October\n2024\n\u00a3\nNet cash from operating activities\nLoss after tax\n(176,515)\n(178,261)\nReverse exceptional credits\n(600)\n(10,316)\nLoss of disposal of investments\n-\n49,837\nProvision for share based payments\nReverse interest paid\n-\n49\n15,406\n255\nOperating cash flows before movements in working capital\n(177,066)\n(123,079)\nMovement in working capital\nDecrease/ (increase) in receivables\n13,852\n(7,950)\n(Decrease)/ Increase in payables\n(17,795)\n3,108\nNet movement in working capital\n(3,942)\n(4,842)\nOperating cash out-flow\n(181,009)\n(127,921)\nInvestment activities\nExpenditure on available for sale investments\n-\n-\nProceeds from sale of investments and options\n-\n108,692\nCash flow from investing activities\n-\n108,692\nFinancing\nShare Capital\nBounce-back Loan repayments\nInterest paid\nNet financing\n202,500\n(5,000)\n(48)\n197,452\n-\n(5,000)\n(255)\n(5,255)\nNet Increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n16,443\n(24,484)\nCash and cash equivalents at start of the period\n212,150\n248,196\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the period\n228,593\n223,712\nIncrease / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n16,443\n(24,484)\nThis financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') interpretations adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, with the prior period being reported on the same basis.",

Completion of the Subscription is conditional on Admission.\nFollowing Admission, the Company\u2019s enlarged share capital will comprise 119,441,253 ordinary shares. No shares are held in Treasury. Therefore, the total number of ordinary shares with voting rights will be 119,441,253.

As all of the Company\u2019s directors are participating in the Transaction, there are no directors independent of the Transaction to be able to consult with the Company\u2019s nominated adviser, Cairn Financial Advisers LLP, that the terms of the Transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as shareholders are concerned. Consequently, Cairn Financial Advisers LLP confirms that the terms of the Transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as shareholders of the Company are concerned.\nPatrick Booth-Clibborn, CEO of Marechale Capital, commented\n: \u201cWe are pleased to announce the completion of the fundraise, which included the participation of both two experienced corporate finance advisors as well as members of the Board, demonstrating ongoing support for the Company and its development, at a time when we are seeing an encouraging increase in the number of projects progressing through our pipeline.\n\u201cWe are delighted to welcome on board our new shareholders, and, in particular, Nick Wells, who we look forward to welcoming, and the wealth of experience and potential deal flow that he brings, especially at a time when we are witnessing an increase in confidence in the market.\u201d\nT\nhis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014.\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital plc\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP (Nomad)\nJo Turner / Sandy Jamieson\nTel: +44 (0)20 7213 0880\nAbout Marechale Capital\nMarechale is an established City of London based corporate finance house, with a long-term track record and a strong reputation in advising & financing high growth consumer brands, leisure, clean energy, and technology companies.

However, against this challenging backdrop, there are significant market opportunities for Marechale\u2019s clients.\nThe Company entered the Period with good levels of business activity and funded clients in both the hospitality sector, as well as clients in other high growth sectors. Completed fund raising projects include further equity funding for the Chestnut Group, the leading East Anglian Inn Group, loan refinancing and growth equity funding for Brewhouse & Kitchen, the UK\u2019s largest brew pub chain, and equity funding was raised for Stubben Edge Capital Ltd, the Insurance industry platform. Also, additional funding has been raised for Weardale Lithium at a premium valuation.\nMarechale continues to generate professional services income by providing advice to its clients. In the last year this included strategic and funding advice for the Chestnut Group and Brewhouse & Kitchen. In addition, as announced to the market in March Marechale acted as exclusive adviser on the sale of Randalls, Guernsey\u2019s largest hospitality businesses as well as providing advice to the shareholder in the UK\u2019s leading resort business and the owner of Rileys, the national snooker business.\nSignificant progress continues to be made with the lithium extraction business, Weardale Lithium Ltd, and our pipeline of new and increasingly diversified projects remains robust.\nWeardale Lithium Ltd is Marechale\u2019s largest investment, comprising 467,000 founder shares and 20,800 options with a combined value of \u00a32.85 million which has been recorded in the Balance Sheet. Weardale has proved lithium reserves in its secured mineral rights in\nCo. Durham\nand as announced to the Market in February became the UK\u2019s first 100% direct lithium extraction plant to receive planning permission to build a pilot plant to use its existing boreholes. Marechale remains optimistic for a positive future outcome on this investment.\nThe total value of the Company\u2019s net assets has reduced to \u00a33,037,000 in 2025 (2024: \u00a33,346,000) equivalent to 2.9p/share (2024: 3.1p/share), due to a combination of Operating Losses and Investment Losses, the latter by taking advantage of an opportunity to sell some Weardale shares for cash, acquired as founder shares, albeit at a discount to their current value. This is in line with Marechale\u2019s stated strategy of using its balance sheet to co-invest in its client companies. Cash at bank at 30th April was \u00a3212,150.\nPlease note that, within the rules of the Accounting Standards, the Board took the decision in 2024 to declare separately as \u2018Exceptional Costs\u2019 various impairment provisions for bad debts and loan notes owed by two Investee Companies. Please be advised that at the time of writing, one of these companies remains trading but is under severe financial distress; the other is now in Administration: however, we managed to recover \u00a310,300 from the latter which has been credited back to this year\u2019s P&L.\nIt is also worth noting that the Company has \u00a3770,000 of unused capital tax losses to offset against any possible future tax liability on realisation of gains.\nMarechale\u2019s revenue for the year saw a substantial reduction to \u00a3409,500 compared to \u00a3668,800, in the previous financial year. In spite of this, gross profit increased to \u00a3274,000 compared to \u00a3197,000 in 2024 mainly due to lower commissions paid to 3rd parties on fundraising income.\nWhilst we continue to navigate through various market challenges, I am pleased to report a significant reduction in Marechale\u2019s operating loss for the year, from \u00a3296,000 in 2024 to \u00a3226,000 this year, mainly due to an improved gross margin of \u00a3275,000 (67%) compared to \u00a3197,000 (29%) in 2024. Marechale\u2019s net loss before tax for the year stands at \u00a3337,000, a notable deterioration from the net loss of \u00a3183,000 reported in 2024. The major year-on-year swing was caused by a significant uplift on the value of investments in 2024 \u2013 principally Weardale - offset by Exceptional Costs, versus in 2025, the sale of investments at a discount \u2013 to raise cash as mentioned above. It is worth noting that we expect to record an uplift in the value of investments based on an equity fundraising already in progress but not yet closed. Administrative expenses remained steady at \u00a3500,000 (2024: \u00a3494,000).\nThe Company\u2019s focus is to use its reputation and deal flow as a corporate finance adviser to build shareholder value in Marechale\u2019s balance sheet. This has been achieved by negotiating equity and warrant positions, and joint venture arrangements as part of its terms of engagement with growth company clients. Marechale\u2019s historical investment performance has been excellent in this regard, having achieved double digit internal rates of return across the total of all the companies that it has funded since 2010. The Board is confident that the investment in Weardale Lithium will deliver an uplift in value in due course.\nSince\nChris Kenning\nacquired his shareholding in Marechale and joined the Board, we have been working together on a number of corporate finance transactions with him and his business Stubben Edge Capital Ltd. We are pleased to report that the first transaction has been achieved, earning commission fees and warrants for Marechale. And we continue to explore how we can digitize our transaction processes for our early-stage corporate finance projects.\nWhilst the current economic climate remains challenging, the Board remains positive about the investments that it holds in its client companies, and optimistic that the Company, with its sufficient cash reserves, will continue to generate further uplifts on its current and future equity and warrant investments, both in the short and longer term. The Company continues to develop further its proven track record as a corporate finance adviser by seeking further deal flow in the high growth \u00a310-100 million Enterprise Value PE sector.\nHopefully there is now the beginning of a shift in sentiment towards investing in the SME space, driven by the Government\u2019s drive for growth, and we hope to see support and incentives towards realising this and encouraging investment in businesses that Marechale works with.\nThe Board is working on a number of initiatives to create further value for shareholders, and the plan is to continue to develop Marechale\u2019s strategic funding partnerships with the objective of enhancing shareholder value.\nThe Board believes, having had a number of approaches over the last few months, that the current disruption in the SME Advisory and Broking market presents an excellent opportunity to attract good quality people into Marechale\u2019s cost effective business structure that allows them to make good earnings and have a shared interest as shareholders\u00a0in Marechale\u2019s balance sheet.\nAs we look to the future, the Board remains committed to building on positive momentum. The Company will continue to focus on enhancing revenue streams and delivering value to shareholders.\nIn closing, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to shareholders, employees, and clients for their continued support and confidence in the Company. The Board looks forward to another year of progress and achievement.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\n21 August 2025\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the UK Market

Statements\nYear ended\n30 April 2025\n1. General information\nMarechale Capital PLC is a company registered in\nEngland\nand\nWales\nunder the Companies Act 2006. The Company's principal activities are the provision of professional services advice and broking services to companies. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.\nThe Company's registered office and principal place of business is 46 New Broad Street,\nLondon\n, EC2M 1JH.\nThe Company's registered number is 03515836.\n2. Basis of preparation\na. Going concern\nIn establishing the applicability of the going concern basis, the Directors have made enquiries as to the financial resources of the Company. The Company has unpredictable revenue due to the nature of corporate finance advisory and the reliance upon deal-driven transactions, however as at the year end the company had \u00a3212k of cash reserves (2024: \u00a3248k) which as at that date equated to approximately 7 months of cash overheads. Whilst the company generated operating losses of \u00a3226k in the financial year (2024: \u00a3296k) the directors remain confident that the project pipeline will generate sufficient income on top of the cash reserves in order to meet the company\u2019s liabilities as they fall due over the next twelve months from the date of approving these financial statements. Furthermore, there is the ability to fund working capital by equity issues, sales of investments and/or warrants and deferral of directors' salaries.\nb. Basis of accounting\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK Adopted International Reporting Standards ('IFRS'). IFRS Interpretations Committee ('IFRS IC') interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified by the valuation of certain financial instruments, as described below.\nThe Directors have chosen not to prepare consolidated accounts because the two subsidiaries, Marechale Limited and Marechale Capital Investments Limited, are both dormant, have never traded, and therefore highly immaterial to the financial statements.\nSubsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control, being the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the acquired entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\n3. Business and geographical segments\nThe directors consider that there is only one activity undertaken by the Company, that of corporate finance professional services advisory. All of this activity was undertaken in the\nUnited Kingdom\n.\n2025\n2024\n(\u00a3)\n(\u00a3)\nBroking commissions and fees earned from corporate finance\n409,413\n668,816\n4. Other gains/ (losses)\n2025\n2024\n(\u00a3)\n(\u00a3)\nRealised (losses) on equity investments\n(99,837)\n(5,402)\nUnrealised gains/(losses) on equity investments\n(31,832)\n250,000\nRealised gains on equity warrants\n8,847\n-\nUnrealised (losses) on equity warrants\n-\n(21,594)\n(122,822)\n223,004\n5. Earnings per share\n2025\n2024\nEarnings\nEarnings\n(\u00a3)\n(\u00a3)\nBased on Profit for the year.\n(337,325)\n(182,987)\nNo. shares\nNo. shares\nWeighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue\n105,941,247\n104,194,580\nfor the purpose of basic earnings per share\nThe loss attributable to equity shareholders and weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per ordinary share are identical to those used for basic earnings per ordinary share. This is because the exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and is therefore under the terms of IAS33 anti-dilutive.\n6. Other matters and Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe financial information for the year ended\n30 April 2025\nset out in this announcement does not constitute statutory financial statements, as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006 but is based on the statutory financial statements for the year then ended. The auditors have issued an unqualified opinion on these financial statements; their report included the following statement:\n\u201cWe have audited the financial statements of Marechale Capital PLC (the \u2018Company\u2019) for the year ended\n30 April 2025\n, which comprise the Income Statement, the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Changes in Equity, the Cash Flow Statement, and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK adopted International Accounting Standards.\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the Company\u2019s affairs as at\n30 April 2025\nand of the loss for the year then ended;\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards; and\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\u201d\n7. Related Party Transactions\nCompany in which the Company holds an investment which have paid fees to the Company\nBurgh Island Holdings Ltd ('BI')\nThe Company owned 10,640 shares, 4% in BI at\n30 April 2025\n(2024: 4%), BI is a related party through common directorship of\nPatrick Booth-Clibborn\n, a director of the Group.\nDirectors\nPatrick Booth-Clibborn\nDuring the year, an interest free travel advance of \u00a35,000 (2024: \u00a35,000) was extended to Mr Booth-Clibborn which is repayable within one year and is included within trade and other receivables on the balance sheet.\nDisclosure of control\nThe company is under the control of its shareholders and not any one party.\nKey management personnel\nThe key management personnel consist of the Directors, whose remuneration is disclosed in the Directors' Report, and the Company Secretary/Financial Officer, Shand FD Ltd ('Shand') whose remuneration in 2025 was \u00a330,014 (2024: \u00a325,964).\nThe group owed Shand \u00a32,806 at\n30 April 2024\n(2024: \u00a31,832).\n8. Post balance sheet events\nThere are no past balance sheet events to report\nCautionary statement\nCertain statements made in this announcement are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from any expected future events or results expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements.
