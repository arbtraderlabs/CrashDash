          "content": "24 Aug 2020 07:00\nRNS Number : 8899W\nMarechale Capital PLC\n24 August 2020\n24\nAugust 2020\nMarechale Capital plc\n(\"Marechale\" or the \"Company\")\nConsolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2020\nMarechale is pleased to announce its final results for the year ended 30 April 2020.\nChairman's statement\nMarechale Capital is an established corporate finance firm providing strategic, M&A and advisory services primarily to hospitality and renewable companies in the UK and Europe. Marechale also finances earlier stage and growth capital companies from its family office, private investor and private equity relationships.\nA year ago we took the difficult decision to significantly reduce our cost base in order to deliver an annual profit and we were on-track to doing so before the Covid lockdown stopped most commercial activity, and specifically investments. Traditionally we earn a significant proportion of our annual revenues in the last quarter, much of it\ntax driven growth investments, which affected our March and April revenues, and meant that we missed our target. Our business, which is predominantly hospitality advisory and growth finance has since been affected by the coronavirus.\nMarechale's revenues for the year of \u00a3477,000 (2019: \u00a3512,000) were slightly down on last year, but because of lower third-party commissions, we delivered a higher Gross Profit of \u00a3422,000 (2019: \u00a3400,000).\nAdministrative expenses were reduced to \u00a3447,000 from \u00a3688,000 in 2019.\nWhilst the Company was not profitable for the year as hoped, the business delivered an operating loss of \u00a325,000, significantly better than the \u00a3288,000 loss in 2019.\nInvestments in two client companies realised gains of \u00a319,350 which were offset by the need to write off \u00a320,850 for an investment now in liquidation, producing a net overall loss of \u00a31,500 compared to \u00a322,000 of gains in 2019.\nThe Company has raised equity and debt funding for a number of new and existing clients. This included funding for the telecommunications business Fast2fibre and raising capital for The Forest Road Brewing Company for their new brewery. Funding for existing clients include leading gastropub group Brewhouse & Kitchen, and the craft spirits distiller Oslo Distillery to finance their further development and product launch into the United States. Additionally, the Company has completed advisory work for a wide range of consumer brand, hospitality and renewable energy businesses.\nIn accordance with IFRS9 Equity Investments and Warrants are valued at 'fair value', typically at a price that reflects their last funding round, and underlying movement in fair value is reflected through the Profit and Loss Account. Given our Investments and Warrants are held, broadly speaking, in the Renewables and in the Hospitality sectors, where under Lockdown the former continued to trade but the latter were closed, with potential well publicised difficulties to re-open, the Board was forced to consider re-valuing the latter at 30 April 2020, rather than two months earlier in healthier times. The Board determined to make a 50% 'Covid 19' downward fair value adjustment of \u00a311,000 (2019: 'non Covid' of \u00a330,000) against all our Hospitality Investments and Warrants in the sincere hope that these may be recovered this time next year.\nThe net effect is a loss for the year before tax of \u00a337,500 compared to a \u00a3298,000 loss in 2019.\nThe balance sheet value has reduced during the year to \u00a3159,000 (2019: \u00a3179,000) which is more fully explained in the Statement of Changes in Equity.\nFinally, it will come as no surprise that current trading is very challenging as there is concern and lack of confidence in the Hospitality sector, nonetheless the Directors are confident that markets will recover. While there is increasing optimism that the worst of Covid is over, there is significant uncertainty as to the timing and extent of any recovery.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\n21 August 2020\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCenkos Securities\nKaty Birkin\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nConsolidated Income Statement\nYear ended\n30 April\n30 April\nNotes\n2020\n2019\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n3\n476,743\n511,691\nCost of sales\n(54,587)\n(111,323)\nGross profit\n422,156\n400,368\nAdministrative expenses\n4\n(447,063)\n(688,171)\nOperating loss\n(24,907)\n(287,803)\nFinance expense\n(251)\n(149)\nOther losses\n(12,372)\n(8,357)\nNet loss in respect of associate\n-\n(1,708)\nLoss before tax\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nTaxation\n-\n-\nLoss for the year\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nLoss per share\n5\nPence\nPence\n- Basic\n(0.07)\n(0.52)\n- Diluted\n(0.07)\n(0.52)\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nLoss for the year\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nTotal recognised comprehensive loss\n(all attributable to owners of the parent)\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nAs at\n30 April\n30 April\n2020\n2019\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCurrent assets\nInvestment in associate\n-\n12,330\nEquity investments at fair value thro"

          "full_content": "19 Jan 2026 12:15\nMarechale Capital Plc - Half-year Report\nMarechale Capital Plc - Half-year Report\nPR Newswire\nLONDON, United Kingdom, January 19\n19 January 2026\nMarechale Capital plc\n(\"Marechale Capital\", \u201cMarechale\u201d or the \"Company\")\nHalf-yearly Results\nMarechale Capital plc, an established City of London based corporate finance house with a long-term track record and a strong reputation for advising and financing high growth consumer brands, leisure, clean energy, mineral extraction and technology companies, announces its unaudited half-yearly results for the six months ended 31 October 2025 (the \u201cPeriod\u201d).\nChairman\u2019s Statement\nA difficult first half to the Company\u2019s year has been a feature of recent years, with 2025 being no exception, particularly with the SME market being challenging. However, the market started to pick up in November 2025, and there has been a healthy new business pipeline developing in recent months.\nDuring the six months ended 31 October 2025, the Company generated a gross profit of \u00a355,310 (2024: \u00a3103,468) and delivered an operating loss of \u00a3177,066 (2024: loss of \u00a3138,485 ), resulting in an overall loss before tax of \u00a3176,515 (2024: loss of \u00a3178,261).\nThe Company\u2019s balance sheet shows a net asset value of \u00a33,063,198 (2024: \u00a33,183,537), representing 2.56p (2024: 3.01p) of value per share in issue. The Board remains positive about the investments that it holds in its client companies, and in particular its core investment in Weardale Lithium.\nWhilst there have been delays in completing some advisory projects during the Period, on a positive note, Marechale has in the last few months completed both debt and equity growth round transactions for Wright Brothers, the UK\u2019s leading premium fish wholesaler and restaurant operator, KBH, one of the UK\u2019s leading \u2018out of home\u2019 media companies on the UK\u2019s railways and cinemas, Weardale Lithium, which has received planning for the UK\u2019s first Direct Lithium Extraction plant and Chestnut Inns, one of the UK\u2019s leading premium inn operators.\nCash at bank as at 31 October 2025 was \u00a3228,593 (2024: \u00a3223,700). However, in the months since the end of the Period, and based on the recent transactions that Marechale has completed, the Company has grown its cash at bank to \u00a3312,000 as at 14 January 2026.\nThe Board is working on a number of initiatives to create further value for shareholders over and above its core investment portfolio and corporate finance projects, including working with various potential businesses and individuals.\nThis plan to continue to develop Marechale\u2019s strategic partnerships in order to enhance shareholder value, and develop new funding partners alongside its traditional investor relationships, has culminated in the successful completion of a placing in Marechale shares in October (as previously announced); this brought in two new strategic investors as well, in addition to all the Company\u2019s directors investing too.\nMarechale Capital continues to see interesting corporate finance and advisory projects; the Board believes despite the challenges of the last few years, that the SME market is looking more positive, and that there is a recognition of value in UK growth companies, particularly with new initiatives for the AIM markets, the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), and the move to encourage more private and institutional funding into smaller UK companies.\nWhilst the current economic climate is difficult, Marechale Capital remains diligent and is convinced that there will continue to be good advisory and investment opportunities in its core hospitality, renewable, clean energy and technology sectors over the short to medium term, where the Company can generate more value enhancing warrant and founding equity holdings alongside advisory cash fees. The Board is also hoping to agree terms on further strategic partnerships, and is in a number of advanced conversations with different parties.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\nJo Turner / Sandy Jamieson\nTel: +44 (0)20\n7213 0880\nIncome Statement (unaudited)\n6 months ended 31 October\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n111,932\n148,500\nCost of sales\n(56,622)\n(45,032)\nGross profit\n55,310\n103,468\nAdministrative expenses\n(232,376)\n(241,953)\nOperating loss\n(177,066)\n(138,485)\nExceptional credit\n600\n10,316\nLoss on disposal of investments\n-\n(49,837)\nInterest paid\n(49)\n(255)\n(Loss) before tax\n(176,515)\n(178,261)\nTaxation\n-\n-\n(Loss) after tax\n(176,515)\n(178,261)\n(Loss) per share\n(Pence)\n(Pence)\n- Basic\n(0.17)\n(0.17)\n- Diluted\n(0.17)\n(0.17)\nBalance Sheet (unaudited)\nAs at\n31 October\n31 October\n2025\n2024\nCurrent assets\nAvailable for sale investments\n2,807,829\n2,939,660\nTrading investments\n58,800\n49,953\nTrade",

However, against this challenging backdrop, there are significant market opportunities for Marechale\u2019s clients.\nThe Company entered the Period with good levels of business activity and funded clients in both the hospitality sector, as well as clients in other high growth sectors. Completed fund raising projects include further equity funding for the Chestnut Group, the leading East Anglian Inn Group, loan refinancing and growth equity funding for Brewhouse & Kitchen, the UK\u2019s largest brew pub chain, and equity funding was raised for Stubben Edge Capital Ltd, the Insurance industry platform. Also, additional funding has been raised for Weardale Lithium at a premium valuation.\nMarechale continues to generate professional services income by providing advice to its clients. In the last year this included strategic and funding advice for the Chestnut Group and Brewhouse & Kitchen. In addition, as announced to the market in March Marechale acted as exclusive adviser on the sale of Randalls, Guernsey\u2019s largest hospitality businesses as well as providing advice to the shareholder in the UK\u2019s leading resort business and the owner of Rileys, the national snooker business.\nSignificant progress continues to be made with the lithium extraction business, Weardale Lithium Ltd, and our pipeline of new and increasingly diversified projects remains robust.\nWeardale Lithium Ltd is Marechale\u2019s largest investment, comprising 467,000 founder shares and 20,800 options with a combined value of \u00a32.85 million which has been recorded in the Balance Sheet. Weardale has proved lithium reserves in its secured mineral rights in\nCo. Durham\nand as announced to the Market in February became the UK\u2019s first 100% direct lithium extraction plant to receive planning permission to build a pilot plant to use its existing boreholes. Marechale remains optimistic for a positive future outcome on this investment.\nThe total value of the Company\u2019s net assets has reduced to \u00a33,037,000 in 2025 (2024: \u00a33,346,000) equivalent to 2.9p/share (2024: 3.1p/share), due to a combination of Operating Losses and Investment Losses, the latter by taking advantage of an opportunity to sell some Weardale shares for cash, acquired as founder shares, albeit at a discount to their current value. This is in line with Marechale\u2019s stated strategy of using its balance sheet to co-invest in its client companies. Cash at bank at 30th April was \u00a3212,150.\nPlease note that, within the rules of the Accounting Standards, the Board took the decision in 2024 to declare separately as \u2018Exceptional Costs\u2019 various impairment provisions for bad debts and loan notes owed by two Investee Companies. Please be advised that at the time of writing, one of these companies remains trading but is under severe financial distress; the other is now in Administration: however, we managed to recover \u00a310,300 from the latter which has been credited back to this year\u2019s P&L.\nIt is also worth noting that the Company has \u00a3770,000 of unused capital tax losses to offset against any possible future tax liability on realisation of gains.\nMarechale\u2019s revenue for the year saw a substantial reduction to \u00a3409,500 compared to \u00a3668,800, in the previous financial year. In spite of this, gross profit increased to \u00a3274,000 compared to \u00a3197,000 in 2024 mainly due to lower commissions paid to 3rd parties on fundraising income.\nWhilst we continue to navigate through various market challenges, I am pleased to report a significant reduction in Marechale\u2019s operating loss for the year, from \u00a3296,000 in 2024 to \u00a3226,000 this year, mainly due to an improved gross margin of \u00a3275,000 (67%) compared to \u00a3197,000 (29%) in 2024. Marechale\u2019s net loss before tax for the year stands at \u00a3337,000, a notable deterioration from the net loss of \u00a3183,000 reported in 2024. The major year-on-year swing was caused by a significant uplift on the value of investments in 2024 \u2013 principally Weardale - offset by Exceptional Costs, versus in 2025, the sale of investments at a discount \u2013 to raise ca",

The Company remains positive about the investments that it holds in its client companies.\nMarechale Capital continues to see interesting corporate finance and advisory projects where it can take founders shares and warrants as part of its advisory fees. On a positive note, Marechale has completed transactions during the period for Weardale Lithium, Forest Road Brewery, Stubben Edge and Chestnut Inns. However, the market remains a difficult environment in which to raise capital. This has resulted in some advisory projects that launched in the summer not being completed by the end of the Period which includes a major UK hotel group and a leading brewery and pub group. Marechale continues to look for new and strategic funding partners alongside its traditional investor relationships.\nThe Board is working on a number of initiatives to create further value for shareholders over and above its core investment portfolio and corporate finance projects, including working with various potential businesses and individuals. The plan is to continue to develop Marechale\u2019s strategic partnerships with the objective of enhancing shareholder value.\nMarechale also uses its balance sheet to co-invest in its client companies, along with warrants and founder equity. Furthermore, the Board is able to announce a partial realisation of \u00a3109,000 for cash on two of the Company\u2019s investments. Cash at bank at\n31 October 2024\nwas \u00a3223,700.\nWhist the current economic climate is difficult, Marechale Capital remains diligent and is convinced that there will be good advisory and investment opportunities in its core hospitality, renewable, clean energy and technology sectors over the short to medium term.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\nJo Turner / Sandy Jamieson\nTel: +44 (0)20\n7213 0880\nIncome Statement (unaudited)\n6 months ended 31 October\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n148,500\n320,603\nCost of sales\n(45,032)\n(226,790)\nGross profit\n103,468\n93,813\nAdministrative expenses\n(241,953)\n(249,235)\nOperating loss\n(138,485)\n(155,421)\nExceptional credit\n10,316\n-\nLoss on disposal of investments\n(49,837)\nInterest paid\n(255)\n(382)\n(Loss)/profit before tax\n(178,261)\n(155,803)\nTaxation\n-\n-\n(Loss)/profit after tax\n(178,261)\n(155,803)\n(Loss)/profit per share\n(Pence)\n(Pence)\n- Basic\n(0.17)\n(0.15)\n- Diluted\n(0.17)\n(0.14)\nBalance Sheet (unaudited)\nAs at\n31 October\n31 October\n2024\n2023\nCurrent assets\nAvailable for sale investments\n2,939,660\n2,863,227\nTrading investments\n49,953\n130,076\nTrade and other receivables\n52,856\n37,219\nCash and cash equivalents\n223,712\n398,229\n3,266,181\n3,428,751\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\nPAYE\nBounce-back Loan\n(54,338)\n(10,806)\n(10,000)\n(51,278)\n(9,847)\n(10,000)\nTotal current liabilities\n(75,144)\n(70,765)\nNet current assets\n3,191,037\n3,357,986\nBounce-back Loan \u2013 long-term\n(7,500)\n(17,500)\nNet assets\n3,183,537\n3,340,486\nEquity\nCapital and reserves attributable to equity shareholders\nShare capital\nShare premium\n847,530\n481,290\n847,530\n481,290\nReserve for own shares\n(50,254)\n(50,254)\nRetained profits/ (losses)\n1,739,397\n1944,842\nReserve for share based payments\n165,574\n117,078\n3,183,537\n3,340,486\nCash Flow Statement (unaudited)\n6 months ended\n31 October\n31 October\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nNet cash from operating activities\nLoss after tax\n(178,261)\n(155,803)\nReverse exceptional credits\n(10,316)\n-\nLoss of disposal of investments\n49,837\nProvision for share based payments\nReverse interest paid\n15,406\n255\n33,091\n381\nOperating cash flows before movem",

Marechale also uses its Balance Sheet to co-invest in its client companies, along with warrants and founder equity, in order to create shareholder value.\nAs reported in the interim results statement in\nDecember 2023\n, it has been a challenging year generally and in the hospitality sector in particular, as a number of businesses negotiated a continuing period of market uncertainty, with increased inflation driven overheads, compounded by a squeeze in discretionary spending. However, against this challenging backdrop, there are significant market opportunities for Marechale\u2019s clients.\nThe Company entered the Period with good levels of business activity and funded clients in both the hospitality sector, as well as clients in other high growth sectors. Completed projects include further equity funding for the European telecommunications technology company, Fast2Fibre, Chestnut Group, the leading East Anglian Inn Group, and for Brewhouse & Kitchen, the expanding gastro pub business. Also, additional funding has been raised for The Forest Road Brewing Company, the award-winning\nLondon\ncraft brewer, as well as a further equity round for Weardale Lithium at a premium valuation.\nMarechale continues to generate professional services income by providing advice to its clients. In the last year this included strategic and funding advice for the Chestnut Group and Brewhouse & Kitchen.\nIn the clean energy space, general market uncertainty has impacted some of our corporate clients whose progress has been delayed and resulted in some investor exits being postponed.\nHowever, significant progress continues to be made with the lithium extraction business, Weardale Lithium Ltd, and our pipeline of new and increasingly diversified projects remains robust.\nWeardale Lithium Ltd is Marechale\u2019s largest investment, comprising 500,000 founder shares and 20,800 options with a combined value of \u00a33.0 million which has been recorded in the Balance Sheet. Weardale has proved lithium reserves in its secured mineral rights in\nCo. Durham\nand has submitted a planning application to build a pilot plant to utilise its existing boreholes. Marechale remains optimistic for a positive future outcome on this investment. Despite some individual write-downs on investments, the overall total value of our Balance Sheet Investments, comprising equity and warrants in client companies, has strengthened. The total value of the Balance Sheet has increased to \u00a33,346,000 in 2024 (2023: \u00a33,227,000). This increase reflects our strategic investment decisions and the underlying strength of our asset base.\nPlease note that, within the rules of the Accounting Standards, the Board has taken the decision to declare separately as \u2018Exceptional Costs\u2019 various impairment provisions for bad debts and loan notes owed by two Investee Companies. Please be advised that at the time of writing, these companies remain trading but under severe financial distress. We expect both companies to be refinanced in the near future, in which case the impairment provisions will be credited back to the P&L in 2024-25.\nIt is also worth noting that the Company has \u00a3770,000 of unused capital tax losses to offset against any possible future tax liability on realisation of gains.\nMarechale\u2019s revenue for the year saw a substantial increase to \u00a3668,816, compared to \u00a3376,000 in the previous financial year. This growth of nearly 78% is a testament to the robust strategies the Company has implemented and the hard work of our dedicated team. However, commissions paid to 3rd parties involved in transactions increased by 81%.\nWhile we continue to navigate through various market challenges, I am pleased to report a significant reduction in Marechale\u2019s operating loss for the year, from \u00a3372,000 in 2023 to \u00a3296,000 this year. Marechale\u2019s net loss before tax for the year stands at \u00a3183,000, a notable improvement from the net loss of \u00a3426,000 reported in 2023.

However, the Board remains positive about the outlook for its investments.\nMarechale Capital continues to see interesting corporate finance and advisory projects where it can take founders shares and warrants as part of its advisory fees. On a positive note, Marechale has completed transactions during the period for the European telecommunications technology company, Fast2fibre, Chestnut Group, the leading East Anglian Inn Group, and for Brewhouse & Kitchen, the expanding gastro pub business. However, the market remains a difficult environment in which to raise capital. This has resulted in some advisory projects that launched in the summer not being completed by the end of the Period. Marechale continues to look for new funding partners alongside its traditional investor relationships.\nDuring the six months ended\n31 October 2023\n, the Company generated gross profits of \u00a393,813 (2022: \u00a372,020) and delivered an operating loss of \u00a3155,421 (2022: loss of \u00a3178,995), resulting in an overall loss before tax of \u00a3155,803 (2022: loss of \u00a3179,502).\nThe Company\u2019s balance sheet shows a net asset value of \u00a33,340,486 (2022: \u00a33,456,430), representing 3.15p (2022: 3.62p) of value per share in issue. The Company remains positive about the investments that it holds in its client companies. As at\n31 October 2023\nthe Company had \u00a3400,000 of cash reserves.\nThe Board is working on a number of initiatives to create further value for shareholders over and above its core investment portfolio and corporate finance projects, including working with\nChris Kenning\n, following his strategic investment of 9.9% of the Company announced in\nJune 2023\n. The plan is to digitise Marechale\u2019s activities and continue to develop strategic partnerships with the objective of enhancing shareholder value.\nMarechale also uses its balance sheet to co-invest in its client companies, along with warrants and founder equity. Furthermore, the Board is hopeful to be able to announce realisations on some of the Company\u2019s investments in the next six months\nWhist the current economic climate is difficult, Marechale Capital remains diligent and is convinced that there will be good advisory and investment opportunities in its core hospitality, renewable, clean energy and technology sectors over the short to medium term.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\nThe information communicated in this announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\nJo Turner / Sandy Jamieson\nTel: +44 (0)20\n7213 0880\nIncome Statement (unaudited)\n6 months ended 31 October\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n320,603\n168,001\nCost of sales\n(226,790)\n(95,981)\nGross profit\n93,813\n72,020\nAdministrative expenses\n(249,235)\n(251,015)\nOperating loss\n(155,421)\n(178,995)\nInterest paid\n(382)\n(507)\n(Loss/profit before tax\n(155,803)\n(179,502)\nTaxation\n-\n-\n(Loss)/profit after tax\n(155,803)\n(179,502)\n(Loss)/profit per share\n(Pence)\n(Pence)\n- Basic\n(0.15)\n(0.19)\n- Diluted\n(0.14)\n(0.19)\nBalance Sheet (unaudited)\nAs at\n31 October\n31 October\n2023\n2022\nCurrent assets\nAvailable for sale investments\n2,863,227\n3,116,441\nTrading investments\n130,076\n146,589\nTrade and other receivables\n37,219\n54,356\nCash and cash equivalents\n398,229\n246,808\n3,428,751\n3,564,194\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\nPAYE\nBounce-back Loan\n(51,278)\n(9,487)\n(10,000)\n(59,627)\n(10,638)\n(10,000)\nTotal current liabilities\n(70,765)\n(80,265)\nNet current assets\n3,357,986\n3,483,929\nBounce-back Loan \u2013 long-term\n(17,500)\n(27,500)\nNet assets\n3,340,486\n3,456,429\nEquity\nCapital and reserves attributable to equity shareholders\nShare capital\nShare premium\n847,530\n481,290\n763,023\n328,413\nReserve for own shares\n(50,254)\n(50,254)\nRetained profits/ (losses)\n1,944,842\n2,346,660\nReserve for share based payments\n117,078\n68,587\n3,340,486\n3,456,429\nCash Flow Statement (unaudited)\n6 months ended\n31 October\n31 October\n2023\n2022\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nNet cash from operating activities\nLoss after tax\n(155,803)\n(179,502)\nProvision for share based payments\nReverse interest paid\n33,091\n3",

Marechale also uses its balance sheet to co-invest in its client companies, along with warrants and founder equity, in order to create shareholder value.\nAs reported in the interim results statement announced in\nDecember 2022\n, it has been a challenging year generally, particularly in the hospitality sector, as a number of businesses navigated a continuing period of market uncertainty, with increased overheads caused largely by inflation driven wage rises, compounded by general staff shortages, and high energy costs, particularly over the winter period. Furthermore, customer discretionary spending is also being squeezed. However, against this challenging backdrop, there are significant market opportunities for Marechale\u2019s clients.\nThe Company entered the Period with good levels of business activity and funded clients in both the hospitality sector, as well as clients in other high growth sectors. Completed projects last year included raising further equity funding for the European telecommunications technology company, Fast2Fibre, and additional funding for Weardale Lithium, Chestnut Group - the leading East Anglian Inn Group, and Forest Road Brewing Company, the award-winning\nLondon\ncraft brewer.\nMarechale continues to generate professional services income by providing advice to its clients. In the last year this included strategic and funding advice for Chestnut Group and Burgh Island. All of the fundraisings were at premiums to Marechale\u2019s equity and warrant holdings investment value.\nIn the clean energy space, general market uncertainty has impacted some of our corporate clients whose progress has been delayed and resulted in some investee and advisory company exits being postponed. However, we are pleased to report the exit of our investment in Future Biogas, the leading UK farm crop anaerobic digestion biogas business, after its acquisition by 3i. We also report that Burgh Island, both an investee and advisory client, is for sale\nSignificant progress continues to be made with the lithium extraction business, Weardale Lithium Ltd (\u201cWeardale\u201d), and our pipeline of new and increasingly diversified projects remains robust.\nWeardale is Marechale\u2019s largest investment, holding 500,000 founder shares and 22,400 options with a combined value of \u00a32.8 million based on the last funding round in\nJuly 2022\n, which has been recorded in the balance sheet. Weardale has secured mineral extraction rights in\nCo. Durham\nvia existing boreholes where there is proven lithium in the brine hundreds of feet below the surface. Marechale remains optimistic for a positive future outcome on this investment.\nInvestments and warrants in client companies generated losses of \u00a352,000 (2022: gain of \u00a32,716,000). It is worth noting that we have \u00a3770,000 of unused capital tax losses to offset against any possible future tax liability on realisation of gains.\nDuring the last year, Marechale generated revenue of \u00a3376,000 (2022: \u00a3622,000), and, although our gross profit margin decreased from 53% to 32%, due to high 3rd party commissions associated with one particular client, administrative expenses remained steady at \u00a3488,000 (2022: \u00a3483,000).\nIn summary, we announce a net loss for the year of \u00a3426,000 (2022: profit of \u00a32,562,000): however, as noted above, 2022\u2019s profits included \u00a32,716,000 unrealised investment gains. During the same period, Marechale\u2019s balance sheet value has only marginally decreased to \u00a33,227,000 (2022: \u00a33,630,000) representing Net Asset Value/Share of 3.4p (2022: 3.8p).\nThe Company\u2019s focus is to use its reputation and deal flow as a corporate finance adviser to build shareholder value in Marechale\u2019s balance sheet. This has been achieved by negotiating equity and warrant positions, and joint venture arrangements as part of its terms of engagement with growth company clients.

Given the impact of the pandemic and Government restrictions on our hospitality clients, it is testament to the skill and hard work of the management teams Marechale advise that, not only have they survived, but they are also strongly positioned to expand and capitalise on market opportunities presented by inherent weaknesses in the sector.\nOur renewable energy and other corporate clients continue to perform well. Marechale has four long standing clients who are looking for a trade exit or IPO in the next three to 18 months, which would crystalise the considerable uplift already recorded on investments and warrants in Marechale's balance sheet. Likewise, the pipeline of new and increasingly diversified projects for Marechale to advise and finance remains robust.\nThe Company entered the 2020/21 financial year with high exposure to the hospitality sector but recovered well in the second half of the year, funding clients in this industry as well as other high growth sectors. Completed projects included further equity funding for the European telecommunications technology company, Fast2Fibre, and additional equity and loan note funding with warrants for The Forest Road Brewing Company for its new brewery. Marechale also raised further equity for national brew pub group, Brewhouse & Kitchen, leading East Anglian Inn operator, Chestnut Group, and award-winning craft spirits distiller, Oslo Distillery. Additionally, the Company continues to generate professional services income by providing advice to its hospitality, renewable and high growth business clients. It is therefore pleasing that, against the effect that the Covid-19 pandemic had earlier in our financial year, Marechale had a strong second half.\nOn revenue of \u00a3400,000 (2020: \u00a3477,000), our gross profit margin reduced from 88% to 64%, which was almost entirely caused by higher than normal third-party commissions payable on one particular client. Administrative expenses remained steady at \u00a3463,000 (2020: \u00a3457,000).\nInvestments and warrants in three client companies generated unrealised gains of \u00a3412,000, offset by a small realised loss of \u00a31,500, compared to a net overall loss in 2020 of \u00a312,000, the latter being realised gains of \u00a319,350 offset by a \u00a321,000 write off and a \u00a310,000 Covid-19 related fair value decrease.\nI am delighted to announce that the net effect is a profit for the year of \u00a3246,000 compared to a loss of \u00a337,500 in 2020. At the same time, the balance sheet value has increased significantly during the year to \u00a3686,000 from \u00a3159,000 in FY20, due to adding both profit and new equity which is explained in full in the Statement of Changes in Equity.\nThe Company's focus is to use its reputation and deal flow as a corporate finance adviser to build shareholder value in Marechale's balance sheet. This will be achieved by negotiating further equity and warrant positions, and joint venture arrangements as part of its terms of engagement with growth company clients. Marechale's historical investment performance has been excellent in this regard, having achieved an average internal rate of return of 13% across all of its client companies for its investor relationships since 2010. On its own account, since 2010, Marechale has realised an overall profit of \u00a3253,000 by investing in and/or benefitting from warrants in client companies, realising proceeds of \u00a3305,000 against a cost of \u00a352,000.\nHistorically, the Company has had limited resources on its own balance sheet to fully capitalise on the opportunity and potential to create sizeable gains. The Company therefore embarked on a sma",

The Company sees significant potential for growth within the technology, alternative and renewable energy and leisure and hospitality sectors as the economy recovers from the current pandemic and the Directors consider that a stronger balance sheet will allow it greater scope to capitalise on and participate in client financing opportunities on advantageous terms.\nRecent transactions concluded by the Company include providing strategic advice to a high growth energy business, which is planning a realisation event in the short term, whereby the Company was able to receive a greater proportion of shares and warrants as part of its advisory fees. In addition, Marechale is now better positioned to invest in and support its corporate clients alongside its investor relationships which it has recently done with a growing global technology group which is on the cusp of its first commercial contract. In this transaction, the Company received further shares in a new equity round, at a premium valuation to previous rounds, together with increasing its warrant position. Finally, the Company completed a short-term, high yielding loan note funding round through its investor contacts, in which it was also able to participate and receive warrants, for a UK hospitality brand with the potential for high growth. The board believes these investments and other maturing warrants and equity and founder equity investments in the Marechale corporate finance portfolio have the potential to generate material value to shareholders.\nMarechale is an established corporate finance firm providing strategic, M&A and advisory services helping to provide finance for earlier stage and growth capital companies from its family office, private investor and private equity relationships where it often co invests. The majority of the Company\u2019s recent share placing funding has been invested in, or committed to, a number of these completed and ongoing transactions, taking the form of equity at attractive valuations and short-term, high yielding loans with warrants attached.\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014 (which forms part of domestic UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018).\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital plc\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP (Nomad)\nJo Turner / Sandy Jamieson / Mark Rogers\nTel: +44 (0)20 7213 0880\nNovum Securities Limited (Broker)\nColin Rowbury\nTel: +44 (0)20 7399 9427",

Marechale also finances earlier stage and growth capital companies from its family office, private investor and private equity relationships. The purpose of this strategic fundraising is to put the Company in a better position to take advantage of investment and co-investment opportunities that are presented to Marechale in connection with its activity for corporate clients. The Company sees significant potential for growth within the hospitality and leisure industries and the technology sector as the economy recovers from the current pandemic and the Directors consider that a stronger balance sheet will allow it greater scope to capitalise on and participate in financing opportunities.\nThe Fundraise has been completed by a number of new and existing investors, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive,\nPatrick Booth-Clibborn\n, who has invested \u00a320,000 to subscribe for 1,600,000 New Ordinary Shares at the Placing Price.

Therefore, the total number of Ordinary Shares with voting rights will be 77,681,151. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change of their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe participation in the Fundraise by\nPatrick Booth-Clibborn\nis a related party transaction pursuant to Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies.

Furthermore, cost savings have been achieved with office rent discounts and, as most of our staff were not working during the first Lockdown, we benefitted from the Government\u2019s Furlough Scheme.\nDuring the six months we generated revenues of \u00a3176,000 (2019: \u00a3173,000) and delivered an Operating loss of \u00a364,000 (2019: \u00a393,000). There were no gains on disposal in 2020 compared to a gain in 2019 of \u00a329,000. The Loss before tax was \u00a364,000 (2019: \u00a364,000).\nIn the current conditions it is important to have as liquid a balance sheet as possible and at\n31 October 2020\nwe held cash at bank of \u00a3177,000 of which \u00a350,000 is subject to a Bounce-back Loan, representing around 5 months\u2019 administrative expenses.\nWe are currently in the second Lockdown, which has dealt another body-blow to the Hospitality Industry. However, we are happy to report that our clients are well managed businesses with strong balance sheets and are looking for expansion opportunities. We remain busy working on new projects in the renewable and telecom sectors as well as developing further new opportunities in the hospitality sector.\nThe Board of Marechale Capital continues to consider its options and its future strategy.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCairn Financial Advisers LLP\nJo Turner / Sandy Jamieson\nTel: +44 (0)20 7213 0880\nConsolidated Income Statement\n(unaudited)\n6 months ended\n31 October\n31 October\n2020\n2019\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n175,837\n173,036\nCost of sales\n(45,999)\n(41,129)\nGross profit\n129,838\n131,907\nAdministrative expenses\n(194,277)\n(224,804)\nOperating (loss)/profit\n(64,439)\n(92,897)\nInvestment revenues\n-\n28,937\n(Loss) before tax\n(63,439)\n(63,960)\nTaxation\n(Loss) for the period\n-\n-\n(63,439)\n(63,960)\n(Loss) per share\n(Pence)\n(Pence)\n- Basic\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n- Diluted\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n(unaudited)\nAs at\n31 October\n31 October\n2020\n2019\nCurrent assets\nAvailable for sale investments\n52,039\n75,481\nTrading investments\n881\n1,550\nTrade and other receivables\n28,162\n72,309\nCash and cash equivalents\n176,675\n83,545\n257,757\n232,885\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables Deferred PAYE Bounce-back Loan\n(72,343) (36,156) (50,000)\n(129,532) - -\nTotal current liabilities\n(158,499)\n(129,532)\nNet assets\n99,258\n103,353\nEquity\nCapital and reserves attributable to equity shareholders\nShare capital\n461,449\n461,449\nReserve for own shares\n(50,254)\n(50,254)\nRetained losses\n(345,965)\n(319,781)\nReserve for share based payments\n34,028\n11,939\n99,258\n103,353\nConsolidated Cash Flow Statement\n(unaudited)\n6 months ended\n31 October\n31 October\n2020\n2019\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nNet cash from operating activities\nOperating (loss)\n(64,439)\n(92,897)\nProvision for share based payments\n5,075\n-\nOperating cash flows before movements in working capital\n(59,364)\n(92,897)\nMovement in working capital\nDecrease in receivables\n33,827\n32,896\n(Decrease) in payables\n(5,020)\n(34,497)\n28,807\n(1,601)\nOperating cash flow\n(30,557)\n(94,498)\nInvestment activities\nProceeds on disposal of available for sale investments\n-\n29,443\nCash flow from investing activities\n-\n29,443\nFinancing\nBounce-back Loan\n50,000\n-\nNet (decrease)/ increase in cash and cash equivalents\n19,443\n(65,055)\nCash and cash equivalents at start of the period\n157,232\n148,600\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the period\n176,675\n83,545\n(Decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents\n19,443\n(65,055)\nThis financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') interpretations adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, with the prior period being reported on the same basis.",

Marechale also finances earlier stage and growth capital companies from its family office, private investor and private equity relationships.\nA year ago we took the difficult decision to significantly reduce our cost base in order to deliver an annual profit and we were on-track to doing so before the Covid lockdown stopped most commercial activity, and specifically investments. Traditionally we earn a significant proportion of our annual revenues in the last quarter, much of it\ntax driven growth investments, which affected our March and April revenues, and meant that we missed our target. Our business, which is predominantly hospitality advisory and growth finance has since been affected by the coronavirus.\nMarechale's revenues for the year of \u00a3477,000 (2019: \u00a3512,000) were slightly down on last year, but because of lower third-party commissions, we delivered a higher Gross Profit of \u00a3422,000 (2019: \u00a3400,000).\nAdministrative expenses were reduced to \u00a3447,000 from \u00a3688,000 in 2019.\nWhilst the Company was not profitable for the year as hoped, the business delivered an operating loss of \u00a325,000, significantly better than the \u00a3288,000 loss in 2019.\nInvestments in two client companies realised gains of \u00a319,350 which were offset by the need to write off \u00a320,850 for an investment now in liquidation, producing a net overall loss of \u00a31,500 compared to \u00a322,000 of gains in 2019.\nThe Company has raised equity and debt funding for a number of new and existing clients. This included funding for the telecommunications business Fast2fibre and raising capital for The Forest Road Brewing Company for their new brewery. Funding for existing clients include leading gastropub group Brewhouse & Kitchen, and the craft spirits distiller Oslo Distillery to finance their further development and product launch into the United States. Additionally, the Company has completed advisory work for a wide range of consumer brand, hospitality and renewable energy businesses.\nIn accordance with IFRS9 Equity Investments and Warrants are valued at 'fair value', typically at a price that reflects their last funding round, and underlying movement in fair value is reflected through the Profit and Loss Account. Given our Investments and Warrants are held, broadly speaking, in the Renewables and in the Hospitality sectors, where under Lockdown the former continued to trade but the latter were closed, with potential well publicised difficulties to re-open, the Board was forced to consider re-valuing the latter at 30 April 2020, rather than two months earlier in healthier times. The Board determined to make a 50% 'Covid 19' downward fair value adjustment of \u00a311,000 (2019: 'non Covid' of \u00a330,000) against all our Hospitality Investments and Warrants in the sincere hope that these may be recovered this time next year.\nThe net effect is a loss for the year before tax of \u00a337,500 compared to a \u00a3298,000 loss in 2019.\nThe balance sheet value has reduced during the year to \u00a3159,000 (2019: \u00a3179,000) which is more fully explained in the Statement of Changes in Equity.\nFinally, it will come as no surprise that current trading is very challenging as there is concern and lack of confidence in the Hospitality sector, nonetheless the Directors are confident that markets will recover. While there is increasing optimism that the worst of Covid is over, there is significant uncertainty as to the timing and extent of any recovery.\nMark Warde-Norbury\nChairman\n21 August 2020\nFor further information please contact:\nMarechale Capital\nMark Warde-Norbury / Patrick Booth-Clibborn\nTel: +44 (0)20 7628 5582\nCenkos Securities\nKaty Birkin\nTel: +44 (0)20 7397 8900\nConsolidated Income Statement\nYear ended\n30 April\n30 April\nNotes\n2020\n2019\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n3\n476,743\n511,691\nCost of sales\n(54,587)\n(111,323)\nGross profit\n422,156\n400,368\nAdministrative expenses\n4\n(447,063)\n(688,171)\nOperating loss\n(24,907)\n(287,803)\nFinance expense\n(251)\n(149)\nOther losses\n(12,372)\n(8,357)\nNet loss in respect of associate\n-\n(1,708)\nLoss before tax\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nTaxation\n-\n-\nLoss for the year\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nLoss per share\n5\nPence\nPence\n- Basic\n(0.07)\n(0.52)\n- Diluted\n(0.07)\n(0.52)\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nLoss for the year\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nTotal recognised comprehensive loss\n(all attributable to owners of the parent)\n(37,53\n0\n)\n(298,017)\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nAs at\n30 April\n30 April\n2020\n2019\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCurrent assets\nInvestment in associate\n-\n12,330\nEquity investments at fair value thro",

Given Nissan's scaling up with its Gigafactory expansion and the UK's broader EV transition there just has to be a massive opportunity here for the north. Why is the UK Govt so slow to help this happen? I think it absolutely WILL happen but quite frankly the need for this stuff in the ground is urgent as it is and building a plant will take 18 - 24 months so why is no one moving on it NOW? I am seriously tempted to quit my various trading stocks and go all in on this with my trading pot. Not much but it would take my holding up to nearly \u00a350k. The appeal is all in Weardale and the huge rise in the spot price of lithium which imho is set to continue well into 2026 before settling on or around the \u00a325k - \u00a330k mark per ton. Producing 10,000 tons per annum gives a potential revenue of \u00a3300m pa. Even after all costs are dealt with that's a massive investment opportunity. Someone WILL definitely snap this up. Only question is who.",

Having thought about this recently I feel it\u2019s more likely that SE just do a takeover of MAC would still be cheap and current share holders will hopefully walk away with rather more than their investments are currently worth here. If SE wanted a listing they\u2019d have one by now so I think it\u2019s just the 8% stake in the Weardale project they might be interested in and they wish to add it to their portfolio of investments. Current mcap of MAC is less than \u00a33m. So propose buying it for say \u00a36m - needs to be fairly decent or share holders might vote against it but between the directors they have over 30% of the company under their control. \u00a36m for an 8% stake in a lithium project that is going to generate approx \u00a3160m of revenue (not profit) at existing lithium prices. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a very decent result for SE. I\u2019d prefer to see the share price closer to 5p before an offer is made for obvious reasons but what ever happens I\u2019m hopeful existing share holders might do well from this point in time.",

Go figure. One whiff of news from the Govt or any partnership and this will just explode. Someone else mentioned it recently and I honestly think they are right, we could be looking at double figures in a day or two if news lands. mcap on potential alone should be more like \u00a310m and even that's well below fair value imho.",

Do you mean before they start to really play games with it and start value destruction so they can eventually pick it up for peanuts? Seems to be what is happening in more and more AIM stocks these days and Rachel Reeves has just made it even easier for AIM company directors to hide intel from share holders by reducing the levels of declaration of information. What on earth will the poor iis do when there are no more pis to fleece again and again? Like the animals they are they will start to turn on each other. Levels of transparency are truly appalling and RR wants to make it easier for people to lose, sorry, invest their money in UK stocks, especially in start ups that desperately need YOUR cash. Ah well.

Something will definitely happen soon but I suspect the UK Govt has thought about all of this and prefers for the private sector to take the strain rather than get involved in more funding. They've thrown lots of cash into Cornish Lithium and that will be their big shout-out, saying weren't we clever, weren't we astute etc etc. Weardale will have to go it alone from here imo but....they could be on the receiving end of some extremely interesting offers very very soon. The company issued this last February on its website 'During the commercial phase, the company estimates it will create approximately 125 highly skilled jobs and generate approximately \u00a31 billion Gross Value Added (GVA) for the North East region.' The price of lithium has been on a tear since then and shows no signs of halting any time soon. The valuation of Marchale and indeed Weardale haven't budged. In fact Marechale has deteriorated considerably. Go figure",

That\u2019s why I think we might just wake up one day to find an RNS with a takeover offer for Weardale. Or, as people have mentioned recently, someone buys out Marechale to get a quick and cheap LSE listing and a decent investment in a UK based Lithium project. Ae there any Chinese car manufacturers based in the north of England?",

And that's at today's prices. China's recent actions to control limit supply will result in a huge squeeze of prices so it's perfectly reasonable to imagine will soon reach \u00a32000 - \u00a33,000 per ton. How this doesn't represent a massive opportunity to some of the equity funds I don't know. I'm hoping Stubben Edge have got this lined up and will do a RTO of MAC and list Weardale on the LSE. They would make an absolute killing. Are we in a chicken and egg scenario and the UK Govt is waiting for the private sector to make the first move so they don't have to offer as much support financially, and the private sector is waiting for the UK Govt to offer a najor Grant to get the whole thing going? It doesn't make sense just now that this project - and MAC's 8% stake - is valued quite so poorly. No wonder the LSE is losing its position as a global financial force and power house. This is valued at \u00a32.5m today. I can sell my house for more than that! Crazy. What and who will light the touch paper here? And when?",

Anyway, if there's a seriously good chance for major profit with this project I just can't see why some business entity isn't acting quickly on it. What's wrong with it?

Ideally both should be supported and encouraged to get going as soon as possible but there seems to have been little or no movement by the Govt since Weardale\u2019s last mention in Parliament (I found it) in Nov 2025. Could Northern make a move to take over Weardale? Cowdorb - tell me who backs Marechale please. A couple of HNWIs? Be realistic, it\u2019s a tiny outfit who may have just hit a jackpot in investing in Weardale Lithium but there are so many layers of activity that need to happen which are ALL out of their control. It\u2019s a high risk stock with tiny mcap so no ii is going to get involved. The best chance for us as existing holders is a Grant from the UK govt which would light the touch paper and make everyone aware of the huge potential sitting in the ground. When I\u2019m feeling a little more positive I think MAC could end up doing brilliantly out of this. When I\u2019m asleep and dreaming I think of Stubben Edge taking over MAC\u2019s listing and all of us making a bundle in the very near term.",

Given Nissan's scaling up with its Gigafactory expansion and the UK's broader EV transition there just has to be a massive opportunity here for the north. Why is the UK Govt so slow to help this happen? I think it absolutely WILL happen but quite frankly the need for this stuff in the ground is urgent as it is and building a plant will take 18 - 24 months so why is no one moving on it NOW? I am seriously tempted to quit my various trading stocks and go all in on this with my trading pot. Not much but it would take my holding up to nearly \u00a350k. The appeal is all in Weardale and the huge rise in the spot price of lithium which imho is set to continue well into 2026 before settling on or around the \u00a325k - \u00a330k mark per ton. Producing 10,000 tons per annum gives a potential revenue of \u00a3300m pa. Even after all costs are dealt with that's a massive investment opportunity. Someone WILL definitely snap this up. Only question is who.",

Having thought about this recently I feel it\u2019s more likely that SE just do a takeover of MAC would still be cheap and current share holders will hopefully walk away with rather more than their investments are currently worth here. If SE wanted a listing they\u2019d have one by now so I think it\u2019s just the 8% stake in the Weardale project they might be interested in and they wish to add it to their portfolio of investments. Current mcap of MAC is less than \u00a33m. So propose buying it for say \u00a36m - needs to be fairly decent or share holders might vote against it but between the directors they have over 30% of the company under their control. \u00a36m for an 8% stake in a lithium project that is going to generate approx \u00a3160m of revenue (not profit) at existing lithium prices. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a very decent result for SE. I\u2019d prefer to see the share price closer to 5p before an offer is made for obvious reasons but what ever happens I\u2019m hopeful existing share holders might do well from this point in time.",

Go figure. One whiff of news from the Govt or any partnership and this will just explode. Someone else mentioned it recently and I honestly think they are right, we could be looking at double figures in a day or two if news lands. mcap on potential alone should be more like \u00a310m and even that's well below fair value imho.",

Do you mean before they start to really play games with it and start value destruction so they can eventually pick it up for peanuts?

What on earth will the poor iis do when there are no more pis to fleece again and again? Like the animals they are they will start to turn on each other. Levels of transparency are truly appalling and RR wants to make it easier for people to lose, sorry, invest their money in UK stocks, especially in start ups that desperately need YOUR cash. Ah well.

That's 10 months after they received permission to develop a Plant for extracting Lithium from the brines in the existing mining channels in that area. No, we won't have to wait a year imo",

They've thrown lots of cash into Cornish Lithium and that will be their big shout-out, saying weren't we clever, weren't we astute etc etc. Weardale will have to go it alone from here imo but....they could be on the receiving end of some extremely interesting offers very very soon. The company issued this last February on its website 'During the commercial phase, the company estimates it will create approximately 125 highly skilled jobs and generate approximately \u00a31 billion Gross Value Added (GVA) for the North East region.' The price of lithium has been on a tear since then and shows no signs of halting any time soon. The valuation of Marchale and indeed Weardale haven't budged.

And that's at today's prices. China's recent actions to control limit supply will result in a huge squeeze of prices so it's perfectly reasonable to imagine will soon reach \u00a32000 - \u00a33,000 per ton. How this doesn't represent a massive opportunity to some of the equity funds I don't know. I'm hoping Stubben Edge have got this lined up and will do a RTO of MAC and list Weardale on the LSE. They would make an absolute killing. Are we in a chicken and egg scenario and the UK Govt is waiting for the private sector to make the first move so they don't have to offer as much support financially, and the private sector is waiting for the UK Govt to offer a najor Grant to get the whole thing going? It doesn't make sense just now that this project - and MAC's 8% stake - is valued quite so poorly. No wonder the LSE is losing its position as a global financial force and power house. This is valued at \u00a32.5m today. I can sell my house for more than that! Crazy. What and who will light the touch paper here? And when?",

Much bigger site than WL and seems more focused on Investment from the private sector rather than WL which is focused on local involvement. Ideally both should be supported and encouraged to get going as soon as possible but there seems to have been little or no movement by the Govt since Weardale\u2019s last mention in Parliament (I found it) in Nov 2025. Could Northern make a move to take over Weardale? Cowdorb - tell me who backs Marechale please. A couple of HNWIs? Be realistic, it\u2019s a tiny outfit who may have just hit a jackpot in investing in Weardale Lithium but there are so many layers of activity that need to happen which are ALL out of their control. It\u2019s a high risk stock with tiny mcap so no ii is going to get involved. The best chance for us as existing holders is a Grant from the UK govt which would light the touch paper and make everyone aware of the huge potential sitting in the ground. When I\u2019m feeling a little more positive I think MAC could end up doing brilliantly out of this. When I\u2019m asleep and dreaming I think of Stubben Edge taking over MAC\u2019s listing and all of us making a bundle in the very near term.",

Given Nissan's scaling up with its Gigafactory expansion and the UK's broader EV transition there just has to be a massive opportunity here for the north. Why is the UK Govt so slow to help this happen? I think it absolutely WILL happen but quite frankly the need for this stuff in the ground is urgent as it is and building a plant will take 18 - 24 months so why is no one moving on it NOW? I am seriously tempted to quit my various trading stocks and go all in on this with my trading pot. Not much but it would take my holding up to nearly \u00a350k. The appeal is all in Weardale and the huge rise in the spot price of lithium which imho is set to continue well into 2026 before settling on or around the \u00a325k - \u00a330k mark per ton. Producing 10,000 tons per annum gives a potential revenue of \u00a3300m pa. Even after all costs are dealt with that's a massive investment opportunity. Someone WILL definitely snap this up.

If SE wanted a listing they\u2019d have one by now so I think it\u2019s just the 8% stake in the Weardale project they might be interested in and they wish to add it to their portfolio of investments. Current mcap of MAC is less than \u00a33m. So propose buying it for say \u00a36m - needs to be fairly decent or share holders might vote against it but between the directors they have over 30% of the company under their control. \u00a36m for an 8% stake in a lithium project that is going to generate approx \u00a3160m of revenue (not profit) at existing lithium prices. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a very decent result for SE. I\u2019d prefer to see the share price closer to 5p before an offer is made for obvious reasons but what ever happens I\u2019m hopeful existing share holders might do well from this point in time.",

I think that interview was filmed longer  ago than two months back, as I first saw it ages ago. I think the current valuation has to be far more, unless they were being hugely optimistic when they first mentioned \u00a31bn. Complete buyout for \u00a320m would be a basement bargain but I feel we will not have much choice but to accept as most of the shares here are held by just a handful of stakeholders",

What on earth will the poor iis do when there are no more pis to fleece again and again? Like the animals they are they will start to turn on each other. Levels of transparency are truly appalling and RR wants to make it easier for people to lose, sorry, invest their money in UK stocks, especially in start ups that desperately need YOUR cash. Ah well.

I think that interview was filmed longer  ago than two months back, as I first saw it ages ago. I think the current valuation has to be far more, unless they were being hugely optimistic when they first mentioned \u00a31bn. Complete buyout for \u00a320m would be a basement bargain but I feel we will not have much choice but to accept as most of the shares here are held by just a handful of stakeholders",

Maybe there are discussions already taking place, hence the silence from all quarters? Betty interesting times ahead here over the next few weeks imo",

What on earth will the poor iis do when there are no more pis to fleece again and again? Like the animals they are they will start to turn on each other. Levels of transparency are truly appalling and RR wants to make it easier for people to lose, sorry, invest their money in UK stocks, especially in start ups that desperately need YOUR cash. Ah well.

I doubt Weardale will do much the next year so I keep a solid stake and then add to this when it gets cheap and look out for a spike. Been doing this for many years. More than I can remember.

Northern Lithium are a competitor and have stolen a march on Weardale by announcing partnership back in Oct to get to production in 2027. Weardale can\u2019t possibly compete financially with what they have now so my feeling is Northern will make a hostile bid for Weardale and MAC\u2019s 8% - which is certainly NOT valued currently at \u00a380m lol - will be thrown in with what I suspect some half decent offer. If Stewart Dickson, with his background, can\u2019t get funding or partners involved then I think the next best thing will be to sell the project at this early stage. It means we won\u2019t get anything like true value but a bird in the hand as the say\u2026. I could see an offer of \u00a330m for Weardale being accepted (10x their current valuation) and that would hopefully mean our 8% would be worth a share price of something nearer the region \u00a32.5m on top of current sp. So basically double where it is now. I would be thrilled with 100% from here as I\u2019ve now got rather a lot of these shares.",

I think that interview was filmed longer  ago than two months back, as I first saw it ages ago. I think the current valuation has to be far more, unless they were being hugely optimistic when they first mentioned \u00a31bn. Complete buyout for \u00a320m would be a basement bargain but I feel we will not have much choice but to accept as most of the shares here are held by just a handful of stakeholders",

What on earth will the poor iis do when there are no more pis to fleece again and again? Like the animals they are they will start to turn on each other. Levels of transparency are truly appalling and RR wants to make it easier for people to lose, sorry, invest their money in UK stocks, especially in start ups that desperately need YOUR cash. Ah well.

I'm sure if someone makes a move on this potential then at some point pis will be off-loaded but there should be a really good chance of a major return on investing at current levels. i guess as always it's a case of not being too greedy. Have to say if it reached 10p I'd probably hop off the ride and bid you all bon voyage.",

Someone somewhere is going to pull a trigger on Weardale and finally get it off the ground - or rather out of the ground! Weardale was mentioned in Parliament as recently as November 2025. That's 10 months after they received permission to develop a Plant for extracting Lithium from the brines in the existing mining channels in that area. No, we won't have to wait a year imo",

Northern Lithium are a competitor and have stolen a march on Weardale by announcing partnership back in Oct to get to production in 2027. Weardale can\u2019t possibly compete financially with what they have now so my feeling is Northern will make a hostile bid for Weardale and MAC\u2019s 8% - which is certainly NOT valued currently at \u00a380m lol - will be thrown in with what I suspect some half decent offer. If Stewart Dickson, with his background, can\u2019t get funding or partners involved then I think the next best thing will be to sell the project at this early stage. It means we won\u2019t get anything like true value but a bird in the hand as the say\u2026. I could see an offer of \u00a330m for Weardale being accepted (10x their current valuation) and that would hopefully mean our 8% would be worth a share price of something nearer the region \u00a32.5m on top of current sp. So basically double where it is now. I would be thrilled with 100% from here as I\u2019ve now got rather a lot of these shares.",

I think that interview was filmed longer  ago than two months back, as I first saw it ages ago. I think the current valuation has to be far more, unless they were being hugely optimistic when they first mentioned \u00a31bn. Complete buyout for \u00a320m would be a basement bargain but I feel we will not have much choice but to accept as most of the shares here are held by just a handful of stakeholders",

What on earth will the poor iis do when there are no more pis to fleece again and again? Like the animals they are they will start to turn on each other. Levels of transparency are truly appalling and RR wants to make it easier for people to lose, sorry, invest their money in UK stocks, especially in start ups that desperately need YOUR cash. Ah well.

Northern Lithium are a competitor and have stolen a march on Weardale by announcing partnership back in Oct to get to production in 2027. Weardale can\u2019t possibly compete financially with what they have now so my feeling is Northern will make a hostile bid for Weardale and MAC\u2019s 8% - which is certainly NOT valued currently at \u00a380m lol - will be thrown in with what I suspect some half decent offer. If Stewart Dickson, with his background, can\u2019t get funding or partners involved then I think the next best thing will be to sell the project at this early stage. It means we won\u2019t get anything like true value but a bird in the hand as the say\u2026. I could see an offer of \u00a330m for Weardale being accepted (10x their current valuation) and that would hopefully mean our 8% would be worth a share price of something nearer the region \u00a32.5m on top of current sp. So basically double where it is now. I would be thrilled with 100% from here as I\u2019ve now got rather a lot of these shares.",

Not really sure why the share price here is almost half of what it was last February but we can only hope that the company is 8% stake in where they are lithium will be given a more realistic evaluation very soon.

I think that interview was filmed longer  ago than two months back, as I first saw it ages ago. I think the current valuation has to be far more, unless they were being hugely optimistic when they first mentioned \u00a31bn. Complete buyout for \u00a320m would be a basement bargain but I feel we will not have much choice but to accept as most of the shares here are held by just a handful of stakeholders",

I'm sure if someone makes a move on this potential then at some point pis will be off-loaded but there should be a really good chance of a major return on investing at current levels. i guess as always it's a case of not being too greedy.

I\u2019m starting to think Stewart Dickson might never have intended to take Weardale Ltd forward but rather was simply happy to bide his time and wait for a buyer. I guess one will arrive sooner or later but by which time how desperate will anyone be to take what Weardale have ? Not looking good with the amount of money exciting MAC every week. Thank heavens for all those trades that keep arriving with less than \u00a310!",

If that\u2019s who the uk Govt decide to support up north then it\u2019s game over for Marechale as they have made a loss do several years in a row now and the only one with any real potential was this one in Weardale. News soon or it just collapses. Directors buddies who put \u00a350k in Oct won\u2019t be best pleased but maybe that was just punt money to them. An awful lot of money has exited MAC in the last month & all in the midst of several trading flurries that are rarely for more than \u00a310. Loads of them all at once spikes the sp and then hey presto someone manages to dump \u00a310k at a higher price.

Northern Lithium are a competitor and have stolen a march on Weardale by announcing partnership back in Oct to get to production in 2027. Weardale can\u2019t possibly compete financially with what they have now so my feeling is Northern will make a hostile bid for Weardale and MAC\u2019s 8% - which is certainly NOT valued currently at \u00a380m lol - will be thrown in with what I suspect some half decent offer. If Stewart Dickson, with his background, can\u2019t get funding or partners involved then I think the next best thing will be to sell the project at this early stage. It means we won\u2019t get anything like true value but a bird in the hand as the say\u2026. I could see an offer of \u00a330m for Weardale being accepted (10x their current valuation) and that would hopefully mean our 8% would be worth a share price of something nearer the region \u00a32.5m on top of current sp. So basically double where it is now. I would be thrilled with 100% from here as I\u2019ve now got rather a lot of these shares.",

I think that interview was filmed longer  ago than two months back, as I first saw it ages ago. I think the current valuation has to be far more, unless they were being hugely optimistic when they first mentioned \u00a31bn. Complete buyout for \u00a320m would be a basement bargain but I feel we will not have much choice but to accept as most of the shares here are held by just a handful of stakeholders",

Do you mean before they start to really play games with it and start value destruction so they can eventually pick it up for peanuts? Seems to be what is happening in more and more AIM stocks these days and Rachel Reeves has just made it even easier for AIM company directors to hide intel from share holders by reducing the levels of declaration of information. What on earth will the poor iis do when there are no more pis to fleece again and again? Like the animals they are they will start to turn on each other. Levels of transparency are truly appalling and RR wants to make it easier for people to lose, sorry, invest their money in UK stocks, especially in start ups that desperately need YOUR cash. Ah well. I too hope there will be news soon that will give at least some life in the old bean yet and allow me to exit at 5p. Maybe too much to hope for.",
