          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "Today 07:00\nRNS Number : 8645P\nKelso Group Holdings PLC\n22 January 2026\n22\nJanuary\n2026\nKelso Group Holdings Plc\n(\"Kelso\" or the\n\"Company\")\nUpdate on Investment in NCC Group plc\nKelso, the main market listed acquisition vehicle, is pleased to announce an update on one of its portfolio holdings, NCC Group plc (\"\nNCC\n\"), the UK listed Cybersecurity and Software Escrow business.\nKelso originally invested into NCC in October 2023, with further investments made during 2024. NCC remains one of Kelso's largest holdings, with 2.0 million shares held at an average in price of 133.7p. In April 2024, Kelso highlighted the potential value uplift that could be achieved if NCC considered separating it's two operating businesses (Cyber Security and Escode).\nNCC announced yesterday afternoon that it agreed the sale of its Escode business to TDR Capital, subject to the relevant conditions and regulatory approvals being satisfied. The transaction values Escode at a total enterprise value of \u00a3275.0 million, compared to the market capitalisation of NCC, on the day prior to the disposal announcement, at approximately \u00a3415.0 million. This disposal follows the announcement of the strategic review in April 2025, confirming that the Board of NCC was investigating a number of options, including a potential sale.\nKelso is pleased to see the Board's commitment to return a significant proportion of the proceeds to shareholders and consult with its shareholders on the quantum and form of this capital return. In addition, Kelso is also pleased to see the announcement of a \u00a370.0 million share buyback programme which is expected to begin imminently.\nFollowing completion of the disposal of Escode, NCC will become the UK's largest pureplay Cyber Security business. On 16 July 2025, the Board of NCC also announced a strategic review in relation to its Cyber Security division. Kelso expects this will result in a sale of the business during 2026. Kelso believes that the synergies to any industry buyer of the business, if it were sold, could be very material.\nBased on Kelso's internal calculations and the figures referenced above, the resulting Cyber Security business implies an enterprise value of \u00a3140.0 million, equating to an EV/Sales multiple of 0.6x on the revenue contribution of \u00a3238.9 million for the period ended 30 September 2025. This represents a significant discount to its peers.\nKelso believes that the disposal of Escode is another example of the extent to which many companies listed on the UK stock market are undervalued.\nAside from Kelso's recent purchase of 400,000 shares in Saga plc as announced on 6 January 2026, the successful \u00a32.0 million fundraising at 3 pence per share on 17 December 2025, there have been no other material changes to any Kelso shareholdings post the interim results update. Kelso continues to hold six material investments.\nKelso looks forward to updating its shareholder on its other shareholdings during the course of 2026.\nSir Nigel Knowles, Chairman, Kelso said:\n'The management team of NCC have delivered an excellent outcome with the disposal of the Escode software business. The remaining Cyber Security operations are well positioned in a highly attractive end market, where independent testing and assurance of cyber defences is an increasingly critical priority for any board of directors or senior management.'\nNote to Editors\nKelso Group Holdings Plc 'Kelso' is a listed investment vehicle founded in November 2022 which is backed now by over 65 individuals known to the Board and more recently a small number of institutions. The Board own close to 20% of Kelso and between them have approaching 150 years of experience in UK listed companies through a mixture of fund management, corporate broking, M&A, private equity and law. Kelso's aim, which is unique, is to capitalise on an undervalued UK small and mid-cap stock market by investing in a small number of stocks being less than ten core investments. Kelso's aim is to actively help its investee companies by offering constructive advice, support and ideas predominantly around investor relations and strategy in order to unlock trapped value. Kelso's current principal holdings are Saga plc, NCC Group plc, THG plc, Angling Direct plc, The Works.co.uk Plc and Selkirk plc. Kelso expects to announce other new investments during 2026.\nFor further information, please\ncontact:\nKelso Group Holdings\nplc\n+44 (0) 75 4033\n3933\nJohn Goold, Chief Executive Officer\nJamie Brooke, Chief Investment Officer\nZeus\n(Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829\n5000\nLouisa Waddell, John Moran (Investment Banking)Ben Robertson (Corporate Broking)\nCamarco (Financial\nPR)\nBilly Clegg, Tom\nHuddart\n+44 (0) 20 3757\n4980\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "6 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 7176N\nKelso Group Holdings PLC\n06 January 2026\n6\nJanuary\n2026\nKelso Group Holdings Plc\n(\"Kelso\" or the\n\"Company\")\nNew investment in Saga plc\nKelso, the main market listed acquisition vehicle, today announces a new holding in Saga plc (\"Saga\") after completing the purchase of 400,000 shares at an average price of 386.5p in January 2026. Saga's market capitalisation was \u00a3551.5m as of close of business on 5 January 2026, having recently exceeded Saga's net debt for the first time in over 5 years.\nRationale for investment\nKelso provides its shareholders with the rationale and background behind this investment below:\n\u00b7\nBusiness evolution\n: Founded in 1951 as a travel company, Saga evolved to being predominately an insurance business by the time of its IPO in 2014 when it was valued at \u00a32.1bn. It has since returned to being predominantly a travel business, driven by its highly cash generative and asset backed ocean and river cruise divisions for the over 50s. Revenue in these divisions has increased more than fourfold since IPO with EBITDA in ocean and river cruising alone now approaching \u00a3100m.\n\u00b7\nDeleveraging\n: Over the last 5 years, Saga's leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA averaged 7.9x, peaking at 12.3x in July 2021, which limited its investment attractiveness for most UK blue-chip equity investors. Leverage has now reduced to 4.3x (as at 31 July 2025) and as it continues to fall, Kelso believes this will unlock the equity story. Formal company guidance forecasts leverage to fall to below 2.0x by January 2030, due to strong cash generation from underlying group pre-tax profits exceeding \u00a3100m. Kelso anticipates this debt milestone may be achieved ahead of guidance.\n\u00b7\nUndervalued\n: Based on Kelso's internal analysis, Saga trades on an EV/EBITDA to January 2026 of c.7.5x using the last reported interim net debt level of \u00a3511m. Despite a strong share price in 2025, we believe there is significant upside from here when compared to peers. As the share price improves, we also note the potential for the company to return to the FTSE 250 in 2026 and the likely consequential buying demand from index funds.\n\u00b7\nPeer Group:\nKelso notes the success of Viking Holdings Inc (\"Viking\") (market cap of c.$32bn), the only other travel company in ocean and river cruises that uniquely serves the over 55s market, which has nearly tripled in value since its US listing in April 2024. Viking now trades on a trailing twelve month EV/EBITDA of over 20.0x. Kelso also observes the share price performance of listed peers in the cruise sector, notably Royal Caribbean whose share price has risen c.8x from its low in 2022 and Carnival whose shares have risen c.4x in the same period, all of which trade on significant premiums to Saga, driven by upgraded guidance during 2025 illustrating the strength of the cruise market.\n\u00b7\nSimplification\n: The disposal of Saga's capital-intensive underwriting operation in 2025 further strengthens its financial position and simplifies its business model. Under the terms of the deal with Ageas, Saga retains ownership of the customer relationship and as such will benefit from ongoing high-quality commission-based earnings over the next 20 years.\n\u00b7\nAttractive market focus with asset-backing\n: Saga is a proven and trusted brand selling into the UK over-50s demographic which Kelso believes is a highly attractive segment. Furthermore, Saga is asset-backed, primarily by its ocean cruise ships launched in 2019/20, which as at January 2025 had a combined cost of \u00a3662.7m, currently held at a book value of \u00a3570.6m, higher than Saga's current market capitalisation.\n\u00b7\nManagement:\nKelso believes that Saga's significant achievements over the last 5 years have been down to its management team. As problems from Covid arose, Sir Roger De Haan stepped back into Saga as Chairman in 2020 and underwrote the majority of the \u00a3150.3m fundraise in the same year. Sir Roger ran Saga for 20 years before selling it to private equity in 2004. After some recent buying, Sir Roger now owns 27.5% of the business. Supported by Mike Hazell and Mark Watkins as CEO and CFO, Saga appears to be in very solid hands.\n\u00b7\nEngagement\n: Kelso has written to the board of directors of Saga with constructive proposals to support value creation, including greater targeting of US investors, particularly given the main three comparable companies will be listed solely in the US soon, alongside some thoughts around accelerating the deleveraging strategy.\n\u00b7\nInvestment decision:\nWith the clear strategic focus, debt falling and profits rising, Kelso believes that now is the right time to invest in Saga.\nSir Nigel Knowles, Chairman, Kelso said:\n'We believe Saga's management have done an excellent job turning Saga around in the last 5 years and materially reducing the debt while growing pre-tax profit. The importance of Sir Roger De Haan's personal backing through significant equity and loan commitments during those hard times should not be forgotten acknowledging that the loans have now been repaid. We believe Saga has the ability, with its focus on travel with ancillary financial services, to return to being a multibillion pound company.'\nNote to Editors\nKelso Group Holdings Plc 'Kelso' is a listed investment vehicle founded in November 2022 which is backed now by over 65 individuals known to the Board and more recently a small number of institutions.

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n17 December 2025\nKelso Group Holdings Plc\n(\"Kelso\" or the \"Company\")\nResult of Placing and Subscription\nFurther to the announcement published on 15 December 2025, Kelso, the main market listed acquisition vehicle, is pleased to announce that it has conditionally raised gross proceeds of \u00a32.05 million through the placing of 59,333,331 million new ordinary shares (\n\"Placing Shares\"\n) and the subscription for 8,999,999 million new ordinary shares (\n\"Subscription Shares\"\n) at an issue price of 3.0 pence per share (the \"\nIssue Price\n\") (the \"\nFundraising\n\"). In aggregate, the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares represent approximately 18.27 per cent. of the existing issued share capital of the Company.\nKelso will use the net proceeds from the Fundraising to expand its\ncurrent investment portfolio into identified opportunities which will improve the balance of risk versus reward.\nThe Company has made an application to admit the new ordinary shares to the Official List of the FCA and to the Main Market (Standard List) of the London Stock Exchange (\n\"LSE\"\n). It is expected that settlement for the Placing Shares and Subscriptions Shares, and Admission, will become effective at 8:00 a.m. on 19 December 2025, and that dealings in the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares will commence at that time. The Placing Shares and Subscription Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing issued Ordinary Share of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of the existing issued Ordinary Shares after Admission.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares and voting rights in the Company will be 442,403,329. This\nfigure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nSir Nigel Knowles, Chairman, Kelso said:\n\"I'm delighted to see the support from our shareholders for this fundraising. We believe the UK small cap market offers significant value and we look forward to updating shareholders on our new investments in due course.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nKelso Group Holdings\nplc\n+44 (0) 75 4033\n3933\nJohn Goold, Chief Executive Officer\nJamie Brooke, Chief Investment Officer\nIan Selby, Chief Financial Officer\nZeus\n(Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829\n5000\nLouisa Waddell, Andrew de Andrade (Investment Banking)Ben Robertson (Corporate Broking)\nCamarco (Financial\nPR)\nBilly Clegg, Tom\nHuddart\n+44 (0) 20 3757\n4980\nAbout Kelso\nKelso was established in November 2022 to identify, engage and unlock trapped value in the UK stock market.
