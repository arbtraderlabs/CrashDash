Following Selkirk's initial 'Intention to Float' announcement on 17 October 2024 as a single company acquisition vehicle, it released a final Schedule One announcement on 4 November 2024 confirming that Selkirk was to IPO with a market capitalisation of c.\u00a310 million, with trading commencing today, Thursday 7 November 2024 (\"Admission\"). The Schedule One Announcement stated that Kelso will own c.18% of Selkirk's share capital and included a list of significant shareholders, being shareholders who will on Admission hold over 3% of Selkirk's share capital. The Schedule One announcement can be found on the following link,\nSchedule One Update\nKelso also announces today that Oliver Hemsley has agreed to become Chairman of Kelso's newly established Advisory Board. The role of the Advisory Board will be to help Kelso with its strategic growth ambitions and execution to build the business and create shareholder value over the long term.\nOliver Hemsley set up Hemsley & Co Securities in 1990 to help provide capital to the Lloyd's of London Insurance market and shortly afterwards bought Raphael Zorn. These businesses combined to become Numis Securities (\"Numis\") in 2000 which Oliver ran as CEO for the next 17 years. Under Oliver's leadership Numis became one of the preeminent brokers and advisers in the UK market. His network and experience will be invaluable for the future success of Kelso. Oliver also acts as a Senior Adviser to Panmure Liberum.\nAs part of this agreement Kelso will grant Oliver a warrant to subscribe for 10m Kelso shares with a 4.0p strike price, equal to the closing price on 6 November 2024, being the last business day prior to this announcement. These warrants will be exercisable in tranches over the next 5 years.\nSir Nigel Knowles, Chairman, Kelso Group, said:\n\"I am delighted with the establishment of Selkirk, Kelso's first single company acquisition vehicle. This is the next phase of Kelso's strategy helping to identify, engage and unlock trapped value in the UK companies.\n\"I am also extremely pleased that Oliver Hemsley has agreed to support Kelso with its strategic growth ambitions and execution in his new role of Chairman of our Advisory Board. We believe that Kelso has a great opportunity over the next few years to build a substantial business and create value for our shareholders. Working with the best people is crucial to that strategy.\"\nFor further information please contact:\nKelso Group Holdings plc\n+44 (0)\u00a075 4033 3933\nJohn Goold, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Kirkland, Chief Financial Officer\nJamie Brooke, Chief Investment Officer\nZeus (Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nNick Cowles, Louisa Waddell, John Moran (Investment Banking)\nBen Robertson (Corporate Broking)\nCamarco\n+44 (0) 20 3757 4980\nBilly Clegg, Tom Huddart\nAbout Kelso\nKelso was established in November 2022 to identify, engage and unlock trapped value in the UK stock market.

Kelso will, in particular, look for situations where it believes the sum of the parts of a business is greater than the current value. The Kelso team is led by an experienced and well-invested Board and management team with a track record of identifying and creating value in the UK small and mid-cap public markets. There may be instances where Kelso itself could be used as a vehicle by an undervalued company to spin off a subsidiary into its own listing. The board of Kelso owns 20.5% of the equity having invested in each of the last three fundraising rounds.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As such, more than ever Kelso urges boards and management teams to do everything they can to recognise and address vulnerabilities, and to maximise shareholder value.\nOn 30 October 2023, Kelso wrote to the Board of Directors at THG outlining its conviction in the substantial value creation opportunity at the company. Kelso firmly believes that THG's sum of the parts is worth significantly more than the Company's current market capitalisation, and specifically that a demerger announcement is the most compelling route to resolving the inherent disparity between THG's share price and its fundamental fair value. As Kelso has stated previously, many of the larger global peers for THG's Nutrition business trade on over 3-7x sales valuation multiples, while several of the larger global Beauty brands trade on 3-5x sales. By comparison, THG trades on around 0.5x sales. Kelso believes that the UK stock market will not ascribe a sum of the parts valuation to THG, until the company publicly confirms its intention to demerge its businesses. Such a demerger would allow each part of the business better access to capital to deliver further growth and build upon their market leading positions. There are several good examples of such demerger confirmations on the LSE, including Whitbread's demerger of Costa Coffee in April 2018 and GSK's Consumer Healthcare business in July 2021. Kelso remains agnostic as to how THG chooses to prosecute the demerger strategy.\nJohn Goold, CEO of Kelso commented:\n\"We believe that the market would respond well to a formal confirmation of a demerger of THG. Whilst there are a multitude of reasons why the valuation of many smaller companies remains at very low levels, companies need to ensure that they have clear strategies in place to maximise shareholder value and to avoid unwanted predatory interest at the wrong levels. We hope that THG adopts our beliefs and announces a strategy for the demerger of its three stand-out global businesses without further delay\".\nLetter to THG plc\n30 October 2023\nDear Board of Directors of THG Plc (\"THG\")\nI write to you today as CEO of Kelso Group Holdings Plc to request that you work actively and rapidly towards addressing the inherent disparity between THG's share price and true value. Specifically, we request you make an announcement, as detailed below, and conduct a shareholder review. I assume you feel the same frustration as shareholders and that you are keen to solve this issue rapidly. Kelso remains a supportive but increasingly frustrated shareholder.\nKelso continues to believe strongly that the three distinct businesses within THG are worth considerably more, as separate businesses, than the current market capitalisation of THG. Liberum continues to highlight this disparity in their research. Some of the world's largest companies operate in the beauty and F&B sectors and typically, due to the quality of their business, brand value and focus, trade on relatively high multiples. The stock market does not value diversified conglomerates, which THG is deemed to be. We are not aware of any global companies that operate in both the beauty and F&B sectors. Many of these companies have historically been extremely acquisitive and in particular F&B companies are growing their presence in nutritional and wellness.\nKelso believes that the stock market will not ascribe a sum of the parts valuation to THG until the board confirms, by way of an RNS announcement, that its stated intention is to demerge the three divisions. Demerging the businesses could be done via full, majority or minority disposals of each division, most likely sequentially (we refer to any of these options as the \"demerger\"). We do not propose to suggest the order of events, merely that it is made clear to shareholders that all options are being considered. Such an announcement would, in our view, help to close the valuation gap and so enhance the ability to achieve the true value in any of the demerger options. Our confidence in this approach was recently enhanced by the positive share price move resulting from the CEO Matthew Moulding's strategic optionality comments in the Q&A part of the Q3 trading statement. However, we believe comments alone do not go far enough, and that the market wants to hear formal confirmation of, and articulation of possibilities regarding the company's intention to demerge. THG's real strategic optionality is enhanced as the share price increases.\nFurthermore, whilst the share price remains low, THG is susceptible to an opportunistic bid; this is a real risk without a supportive shareholder base. Another benefit is that such a statement will significantly reduce your share price volatility making THG a more attractive investment for traditional long only funds and stop hedge funds profiting from and driving the current volatility.\nLiberum's price target is 225p per share but only when a sum of the parts valuation becomes relevant. We think that more analysts would consider increasing their target prices if a formal demerger intention announcement was made. We also believe that such a demerger would be highly advantageous to the valuation of Ingenuity in turning its internal revenues to external ones, enhancing its ability to win third party contracts.\nIn summary, we believe it would be extremely helpful to THG's valuation if it publicly included the following on an RNS announcement:\n1. The board's intention is to demerge the businesses in the medium term.\n2. The demerger could be by way of separate listings with THG retaining majority or minority ongoing control, or outright disposals potentially with THG retaining an interest.\n3. The board is open to strategic partnerships as part of this strategy.\nWe acknowledge fully that Kelso is a small shareholder, but we believe that many other shareholders, both small and large, share our view, having become increasingly frustrated and impatient. We urge you to engage an independent third party now to canvas shareholders for their views, so you can understand which actions your shareholders wish their board to act on. We believe a demerger announcement will be one of their principal requirements.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Goold, CEO\nFor further information please contact:\nKelso Group Holdings plc\n+44 (0)\n75 4033 3933\nJohn Goold, Chief Executive Officer\nMark Kirkland, Chief Financial Officer\nJamie Brooke, Chief Investment Officer\nZeus (Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829 5000\nNick Cowles, Ed Beddows (Investment Banking)\nBen Robertson (Corporate Broking)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
