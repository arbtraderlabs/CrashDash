          "content": "6 Jan 2026 07:00\nRNS Number : 7176N\nKelso Group Holdings PLC\n06 January 2026\n6\nJanuary\n2026\nKelso Group Holdings Plc\n(\"Kelso\" or the\n\"Company\")\nNew investment in Saga plc\nKelso, the main market listed acquisition vehicle, today announces a new holding in Saga plc (\"Saga\") after completing the purchase of 400,000 shares at an average price of 386.5p in January 2026. Saga's market capitalisation was \u00a3551.5m as of close of business on 5 January 2026, having recently exceeded Saga's net debt for the first time in over 5 years.\nRationale for investment\nKelso provides its shareholders with the rationale and background behind this investment below:\n\u00b7\nBusiness evolution\n: Founded in 1951 as a travel company, Saga evolved to being predominately an insurance business by the time of its IPO in 2014 when it was valued at \u00a32.1bn. It has since returned to being predominantly a travel business, driven by its highly cash generative and asset backed ocean and river cruise divisions for the over 50s. Revenue in these divisions has increased more than fourfold since IPO with EBITDA in ocean and river cruising alone now approaching \u00a3100m.\n\u00b7\nDeleveraging\n: Over the last 5 years, Saga's leverage ratio of net debt to EBITDA averaged 7.9x, peaking at 12.3x in July 2021, which limited its investment attractiveness for most UK blue-chip equity investors. Leverage has now reduced to 4.3x (as at 31 July 2025) and as it continues to fall, Kelso believes this will unlock the equity story. Formal company guidance forecasts leverage to fall to below 2.0x by January 2030, due to strong cash generation from underlying group pre-tax profits exceeding \u00a3100m. Kelso anticipates this debt milestone may be achieved ahead of guidance.\n\u00b7\nUndervalued\n: Based on Kelso's internal analysis, Saga trades on an EV/EBITDA to January 2026 of c.7.5x using the last reported interim net debt level of \u00a3511m. Despite a strong share price in 2025, we believe there is significant upside from here when compared to peers. As the share price improves, we also note the potential for the company to return to the FTSE 250 in 2026 and the likely consequential buying demand from index funds.\n\u00b7\nPeer Group:\nKelso notes the success of Viking Holdings Inc (\"Viking\") (market cap of c.$32bn), the only other travel company in ocean and river cruises that uniquely serves the over 55s market, which has nearly tripled in value since its US listing in April 2024. Viking now trades on a trailing twelve month EV/EBITDA of over 20.0x. Kelso also observes the share price performance of listed peers in the cruise sector, notably Royal Caribbean whose share price has risen c.8x from its low in 2022 and Carnival whose shares have risen c.4x in the same period, all of which trade on significant premiums to Saga, driven by upgraded guidance during 2025 illustrating the strength of the cruise market.\n\u00b7\nSimplification\n: The disposal of Saga's capital-intensive underwriting operation in 2025 further strengthens its financial position and simplifies its business model. Under the terms of the deal with Ageas, Saga retains ownership of the customer relationship and as such will benefit from ongoing high-quality commission-based earnings over the next 20 years.\n\u00b7\nAttractive market focus with asset-backing\n: Saga is a proven and trusted brand selling into the UK over-50s demographic which Kelso believes is a highly attractive segment. Furthermore, Saga is asset-backed, primarily by its ocean cruise ships launched in 2019/20, which as at January 2025 had a combined cost of \u00a3662.7m, currently held at a book value of \u00a3570.6m, higher than Saga's current market capitalisation.\n\u00b7\nManagement:\nKelso believes that Saga's significant achievements over the last 5 years have been down to its management team. As problems from Covid arose, Sir Roger De Haan stepped back into Saga as Chairman in 2020 and underwrote the majority of the \u00a3150.3m fundraise in the same year. Sir Roger ran Saga for 20 years before selling it to private equity in 2004. After some recent buying, Sir Roger now owns 27.5% of the business. Supported by Mike Hazell and Mark Watkins as CEO and CFO, Saga appears to be in very solid hands.\n\u00b7\nEngagement\n: Kelso has written to the board of directors of Saga with constructive proposals to support value creation, including greater targeting of US investors, particularly given the main three comparable companies will be listed solely in the US soon, alongside some thoughts around accelerating the deleveraging strategy.\n\u00b7\nInvestment decision:\nWith the clear strategic focus, debt falling and profits rising, Kelso believes that now is the right time to invest in Saga.\nSir Nigel Knowles, Chairman, Kelso said:\n'We believe Saga's management have done an excellent job turning Saga around in the last 5 years and materially reducing the debt while growing pre-tax profit. The importance of Sir Roger De Haan's personal backing through significant equity and loan commitments during those hard times should not be forgotten acknowledging that the loans have now been repaid. We believe Saga has the ability, with its focus on travel with ancillary financial services, to return to being a multibillion pound company.'\nNote to Editors\nKelso Group Holdings Plc 'Kelso' is a listed investment vehicle founded in November 2022 which is backed now by over 65 individuals known to the Board and more recently a small number of institutions. The Board own close to 20% of Kelso and between them have approaching 150 years of experience in UK listed companies through a mixture of fund management, corporate broking, M&A, private equity and law. Kelso's aim, which is unique, is to capitalise on an undervalued UK small and mid-cap stock market by investing in a small number of stocks being less than ten core investments. Kelso's aim is to actively help its investee companies by offering constructive advice, support and ideas predominantly around investor relations and strategy in order to unlock trapped value. Kelso's current principal holdings are Saga plc, NCC Group plc, THG plc, Angling Direct plc, The Works.co.uk Plc and Selkirk plc. Kelso expects to announce other new investments during 2026.\nFor further information, please\ncontact:\nKelso Group Holdings\nplc\n+44 (0) 75 4033\n3933\nJohn Goold, Chief Executive Officer\nJamie Brooke, Chief Investment Officer\nZeus\n(Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829\n5000\nLouisa Waddell, John Moran (Investment Banking)Ben Robertson (Corporate Broking)\nCamarco (Financial\nPR)\nBilly Clegg, Tom\nHuddart\n+44 (0) 20 3757\n4980\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n17 December 2025\nKelso Group Holdings Plc\n(\"Kelso\" or the \"Company\")\nResult of Placing and Subscription\nFurther to the announcement published on 15 December 2025, Kelso, the main market listed acquisition vehicle, is pleased to announce that it has conditionally raised gross proceeds of \u00a32.05 million through the placing of 59,333,331 million new ordinary shares (\n\"Placing Shares\"\n) and the subscription for 8,999,999 million new ordinary shares (\n\"Subscription Shares\"\n) at an issue price of 3.0 pence per share (the \"\nIssue Price\n\") (the \"\nFundraising\n\"). In aggregate, the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares represent approximately 18.27 per cent. of the existing issued share capital of the Company.\nKelso will use the net proceeds from the Fundraising to expand its\ncurrent investment portfolio into identified opportunities which will improve the balance of risk versus reward.\nThe Company has made an application to admit the new ordinary shares to the Official List of the FCA and to the Main Market (Standard List) of the London Stock Exchange (\n\"LSE\"\n). It is expected that settlement for the Placing Shares and Subscriptions Shares, and Admission, will become effective at 8:00 a.m. on 19 December 2025, and that dealings in the Placing Shares and Subscription Shares will commence at that time.

Upon the publication of this Announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n15 December 2025\nKelso Group Holdings Plc\n(\"Kelso\" or the \"Company\")\nProposed Placing and Subscription\nKelso, the main market listed investment vehicle, today announces its intention to raise \u00a31 million by way of a placing and subscription of new ordinary shares of \u00a30.01 each (the \"Fundraising\").\nOverview\nKelso was founded in November 2022 with the aim of creating a basket of investments that could capitalise on a depressed UK stock market by investing in established but undervalued UK-listed small and mid-cap companies. Significant progress has been made in the three years since Kelso's inception, and the Board believe that there are finally clear signs of the UK small and mid-cap market beginning to improve.\nKelso, which is c.20% owned by the Board of Directors, currently has five investments and a strategy of driving value enhancement through active engagement. It is now the Board's intention to grow the business and the proceeds from the Proposed Placing will be used to expand Kelso's current investment portfolio into identified opportunities which will improve the balance of risk versus reward. The investments will be made in line with Kelso's business model which aims to identify opportunities where the board believes the market has underestimated the intrinsic value and where a catalyst is required to unlock that value.\nFundraising\nKelso has carried out three previous fundraises, raising \u00a33.0 million in January 2023 at a price of 2.0 pence per share, \u00a33.0 million in June 2023 at a price of 2.5 pence per share and \u00a31.9 million in February 2024 at a price of 3.0 pence per share. The Fundraising is expected to be undertaken at a placing price of 3.0 pence per share and will be carried out within the Company's existing shareholder authorities and with no requirement to publish a prospectus.\nThe Fundraising will be carried out in collaboration with Kelso's broker, Zeus Capital Limited (\"Zeus\") and is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the appendix to this announcement.\nA further announcement confirming the outcome of the Fundraising will be made in due course.\nFor further information, please\ncontact:\nKelso Group Holdings\nplc\n+44 (0) 75 4033\n3933\nJohn Goold, Chief Executive Officer\nJamie Brooke, Chief Investment Officer\nIan Selby, Chief Financial Officer\nZeus\n(Broker)\n+44 (0) 20 3829\n5000\nLouisa Waddell, Andrew de Andrade (Investment Banking)Ben Robertson (Corporate Broking)\nCamarco (Financial\nPR)\nBilly Clegg, Tom\nHuddart\n+44 (0) 20 3757\n4980\nAbout Kelso\nKelso was established in November 2022 to identify, engage and unlock trapped value in the UK stock market.

The Placing is not being underwritten by Zeus or any other person.\nThe exact number of Placing Shares to be allocated and issued to Placees shall be determined by Zeus and the Company following completion of the Bookbuild (as defined below).\nThe Placing Shares will, when issued, be subject to the memorandum and articles of association of the Company and credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing issued ordinary shares of \u00a30.01 each (\"Ordinary Shares\"), including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of such Ordinary Shares after the date of issue of the Placing Shares.\nCommencing today, Zeus will be conducting a bookbuilding process to determine demand for participation in the Placing by Placees (the \"Bookbuild\"). This Appendix gives details of the Terms and Conditions of, and the mechanics of participation in, the Placing. No commissions will be paid by or to Placees in respect of any participation in the Placing or subscription for Placing Shares.\nA bid in the Bookbuild will be made on the Terms and Conditions which are attached to this Appendix and will be legally binding on the Placee on behalf of which it is made and, except with Zeus's consent, will not be capable of variation or revocation after the close of the Bookbuild.\nThe book will open with immediate effect. The final number of Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing will be agreed by Zeus and the Company at the close of the Bookbuild, and the result of the Placing will be announced as soon as practicable thereafter. The timing for the close of the Bookbuild shall be at the discretion of Zeus. The allocation of the Placing Shares shall be determined by agreement between the Company and Zeus.\nTo the fullest extent permissible by law, neither:\na) Zeus;\nb) any of its affiliates, agents, advisers, directors, officers, consultants or employees; nor\nc) to the extent not contained within (a) or (b), any person connected with Zeus as defined in the FSMA ((b) and (c) being, together, \"affiliates\", and individually, an \"affiliate\", of Zeus),\nshall have any liability (including, to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) to Placees or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise.

Once they have made a Recorded Commitment, each Placee will have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to Zeus (as agent for the Company), to subscribe and pay for, at the Placing Price, the number of Placing Shares allocated to it, up to the agreed maximum.\nEach Placee's allocation (and whether such Placee participates in the Placing) will be determined by agreement between the Company and Zeus and will be confirmed by Zeus either orally or in writing via a contract note.\nEach Placee's commitment will be confirmed in and evidenced by a Recorded Commitment. These Terms and Conditions will be deemed incorporated into each contract which is entered into by way of a Recorded Commitment and will be legally binding on the relevant Placee(s) on behalf of whom the commitment is made with effect from the end of the Recorded Commitment and, except with Zeus's prior written consent, will not be capable of variation or revocation after the close of the Bookbuild. A contract note confirming each Placee's allocation of Placing Shares will be sent to them following the Recorded Commitment and the allocation process. These Terms and Conditions shall be deemed incorporated into any such contract note.\nEach Placee will have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to Zeus (as agent for the Company), to pay to it (or as it may direct) in cleared funds an amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of Placing Shares allocated to such Placee.\nZeus and the Company reserve the right to scale back the number of Placing Shares to be subscribed by any Placee in the event that the Placing is oversubscribed. Zeus and the Company also reserve the right not to accept offers to subscribe for Placing Shares or to accept such offers in part rather than in whole. The acceptance and, if applicable, scaling back of offers shall be at the absolute discretion of Zeus and the Company.\nExcept as required by law or regulation, no press release or other announcement will be made by Zeus or the Company using the name of any Placee (or its agent), in its capacity as Placee (or agent), other than with such Placee's prior written consent.\nIrrespective of the time at which a Placee's allocation(s) pursuant to the Placing is/are confirmed, settlement for all Placing Shares to be acquired pursuant to the Placing will be required to be made at the same time on the basis explained below under \"Registration and Settlement\".\nAll obligations under the Placing will be subject to fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under \"Conditions of the Placing\" and to the Placing not being terminated on the basis referred to below under \"Termination of the Placing\".\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations in respect of the Placing will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee.\nConditions of the Placing\nThe Placing is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms. Zeus's obligations under the Placing Agreement are conditional on certain conditions, including:\na) Admission occurring at or before 8:00 a.m. on 18 December 2025 (London time) or by such later time as the Company and Zeus agree not later than 8:00am on 31 December 2025;\nb) the warranties of the Company being and remaining true and accurate and not misleading as at the date of the Placing Agreement and immediately prior to Admission;\nc) the publication by the Company of, among other announcements, the announcement of the results of the Placing on a Regulatory Information Service;\nd) the Company allotting, subject only to Admission, the relevant Placing Shares in accordance with the Placing Agreement; and\ne) the delivery to Zeus of certain documentary conditions precedent.\nIf: (i) any of the conditions contained in the Placing Agreement, including those described above, are not fulfilled or (where applicable) waived or extended in writing by Zeus by the relevant time or date specified (or such later time or date as the Company and Zeus may agree); or (ii) the Placing Agreement is terminated in the circumstances specified below, the Placing will lapse and the Placees' rights and obligations hereunder in relation to the Placing Shares shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by it in respect thereof.\nZeus may, at its discretion, extend the time for satisfaction of, or waive compliance by the Company with, the whole or any part of any of the Company's obligations in relation to the conditions in the Placing Agreement. Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees' commitments as set out in this Announcement.\nNeither Zeus nor any of its affiliates, agents, advisers, directors, officers or employees nor the Company nor any of its affiliates, agents, advisers, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision it may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Placing nor for any decision any of them may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Placing generally, and by participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that any such decision is within the absolute discretion of Zeus and/or the Company (as applicable).\nTermination of the Placing\nZeus is entitled, in its discretion acting reasonably, by notice to the Company at any time before Admission, to terminate the Placing Agreement in accordance with its terms in the following (non-exhaustive) circumstances:\na) any statement contained in the Placing Agreement or any other document or announcement issued or published by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Placing (\"Placing Documents\") has become untrue, inaccurate or misleading in any material respect or any matter has arisen which would, if the Placing Documents were issued at that time, constitute a material omission from the Placing Documents or any of them;\nb) any of the warranties was materially untrue, inaccurate or misleading when made and/or that any of the warranties has ceased to be materially true or accurate or has become materially misleading at any time prior to Admission, in each case by reference to the facts and circumstances subsisting at that time;\nc) the Company has not materially complied or cannot materially comply with any of its obligations under the Placing Agreement or otherwise relating to the Placing (to the extent that such obligations fall to be complied with prior to Admission);\nd) trading in securities generally on the LSE has been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed or maximum ranges for prices have been required by any such exchanges or by such system or by order of any governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United Kingdom;\ne) a banking moratorium has been declared by the United Kingdom or in London;\nf) there has occurred a material adverse change since the date of the Placing Agreement in United Kingdom to Tax affecting the Ordinary Shares or the transfer thereof or exchange controls have been imposed by the United Kingdom; or\ng) a force majeure event occurs which in the reasonable opinion of Zeus would be likely to be materially prejudicial to the Placing or Admission or the financial or trading position or prospects of the Company or its subsidiaries (the Company and its subsidiaries being the \"\nGroup\n\"), taken as whole, or make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the Placing in the manner contemplated by the Placing Documents.\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees with the Company and Zeus that the exercise by the Company or Zeus of any right of termination or any other right or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Company or Zeus or for agreement between the Company and Zeus and that neither the Company nor Zeus need make any reference to such Placee and that none of the Company, Zeus nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, advisers, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to such Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) whatsoever in connection with any such exercise. By agreeing with Zeus (as agent of the Company) to subscribe for Placing Shares under the Placing, a Placee (and any person acting on a Placee's behalf) will irrevocably acknowledge, confirm, warrant, undertake to and agree with, each of the Company and Zeus, in each case as a fundamental term of such Placee's application for Placing Shares and of the Company's obligation to allot and/or issue any Placing Shares to it or at its direction, that its rights and obligations in respect of the Placing (or any part of it) will terminate only in the circumstances described above and under the \"Conditions of the Placing\" section above and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it in any other circumstances.\nRegistration and Settlement\nSettlement of transactions in the Placing Shares following Admission will take place within the system administered by Euroclear UK & International Limited (\"CREST\"). Subject to certain exceptions, Zeus and the Company reserve the right to require settlement for, and delivery of, the Placing Shares (or any part thereof) to Placees by such other means that they deem necessary if delivery or settlement is not possible or practicable within the CREST system within the timetable set out in this Announcement or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in the Placee's jurisdiction.\nEach Placee allocated Placing Shares in the Placing will be sent a trade confirmation in accordance with the standing arrangements in place with Zeus stating the number of Placing Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price, the aggregate amount owed by such Placee to Zeus and settlement instructions. Each Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions in respect of the Placing Shares, or depositary interests representing such Placing Shares, that it has in place with Zeus.\nSettlement will take place in accordance with the instructions set out in the trade confirmation.\nEach Placee is deemed to agree that, if it does not comply with these obligations, Zeus may sell any or all of the Placing Shares allocated to that Placee on such Placee's behalf and retain from the proceeds, for Zeus's account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by it and may be required to bear any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties due pursuant to the terms set out or referred to in these Terms and Conditions) or other similar taxes imposed in any jurisdiction which may arise upon the sale of such Placing Shares on such Placee's behalf.\nIf Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that the trade confirmation is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation.\nInsofar as Placing Shares are registered in a Placee's name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such Placing Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax.\nRepresentations, Warranties and Further Terms\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) irrevocably represents, warrants, acknowledges, undertakes, confirms and agrees (for itself and for any such prospective Placee) that (save where Zeus expressly agrees in writing to the contrary):\n1. it has read and understood the Announcement and these Terms and Conditions in their entirety and its acquisition of Placing Shares is subject to and based upon all the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, indemnities, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings and other information contained herein and it has not relied on, and will not rely on, any information given or any representations, warranties or statements made at any time by any person in connection with Admission, the Placing, the Company, the Placing Shares or otherwise, other than the information contained in the Announcement and any information publicly announced through a Regulatory Information Service by or on behalf of the Company on or prior to the date of these Terms and Conditions (\"Publicly Available Information\");\n2. it has made its own assessment of the Placing Shares and has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial position and other aspects of the Company in accepting a participation in the Placing and neither Zeus nor the Company nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, advisers, directors, officers or employees nor any person acting on behalf of any of them has provided, and will not provide, it with any material regarding the Placing Shares or the Company or any other person other than the information in the Announcement and these Terms and Conditions or the Publicly Available Information (as defined in the Terms and Conditions);

Pending the provision to Zeus or the Company's registrar, as applicable, of evidence of identity, definitive certificates in respect of the Placing Shares may be retained at Zeus's absolute discretion or, where appropriate, delivery of the Placing Shares to it in uncertificated form may be delayed at Zeus's or the Company's registrar's, as the case may be, absolute discretion. If, within a reasonable time after a request for verification of identity, Zeus (for itself and as agent on behalf of the Company) or the Company's registrar have not received evidence satisfactory to them, either Zeus and/or the Company may, at its absolute discretion, terminate its commitment in respect of the Placing, in which event the monies payable on acceptance of allotment will, if already paid, be returned without interest to the account of the drawee's bank from which they were originally debited;\n31. its commitment to acquire Placing Shares on the Terms and Conditions will continue notwithstanding any amendment that may in future be made to the terms and conditions of the Placing and that Placees will have no right to be consulted or require that their consent be obtained with respect to the Company's or Zeus's conduct of the Placing;\n32. neither Zeus nor any of its affiliates, agents, advisers, directors, officers or employees makes any representation in respect of or shall have any responsibility for the tax treatment that any Placee may receive or expect in relation to their investment in Placing Shares;\n33. it has knowledge and experience in financial, business and international investment matters as is required to evaluate the merits and risks of acquiring the Placing Shares. It further acknowledges that it is experienced in investing in securities of this nature and is aware that it may be required to bear, and is able to bear, the economic risk of, and is able to sustain, a complete loss in connection with the Placing. It has relied upon its own examination and due diligence of the Company and its affiliates taken as a whole, and the terms of the Placing, including the merits and risks involved;\n34. it irrevocably appoints any duly authorised officer of Zeus as its agent for the purpose of executing and delivering to the Company and/or its registrar any documents on its behalf necessary to enable it to be registered as the holder of any of the Placing Shares which it agrees to acquire upon these Terms and Conditions;\n35. the Company, Zeus and others (including each of their respective affiliates, agents, advisers, directors, officers and employees) will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representations, warranties, undertakings, acknowledgements and agreements, which are given to Zeus on their own behalf and on behalf of the Company and are irrevocable;\n36. it is acting as principal only in respect of the Placing or, if it is acquiring the Placing Shares as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it is duly authorised to do so and it has full power and authority to make, and does make, the foregoing representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings on behalf of each such accounts;\n37. time is of the essence as regards its obligations under these Terms and Conditions;\n38. any document that is to be sent to it in connection with the Placing will be sent at its risk and may be sent to it at any address provided by it to Zeus;\n39. the Placing Shares will be issued subject to these Terms and Conditions; and\n40. these Terms and Conditions and all documents into which these Terms and Conditions are incorporated by reference or otherwise validly forms a part and/or any agreements entered into pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and all agreements to acquire Placing Shares pursuant to the Placing will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law and it submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any claim, dispute (contractual or otherwise) or matter arising out of or in connection with such contract except that enforcement proceedings in respect of the obligation to make payment for the Placing Shares (together with interest chargeable thereon) may be taken by the Company or Zeus in any jurisdiction in which the relevant Placee is incorporated or in which any of its securities have a quotation on a recognised stock exchange.\nBy participating in the Placing, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) agrees to indemnify and hold the Company, Zeus and each of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers and employees harmless from any and all costs, claims, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with any breach of the representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings given by the Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) in these Terms and Conditions or incurred by Zeus, the Company or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees arising from the non-performance of the Placee's obligations as set out in these Terms and Conditions, and further agrees that the provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall survive after the completion of the Placing.\nThe agreement to allot and issue Placing Shares to Placees (or the persons for whom Placees are contracting as agent) free of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax in the United Kingdom relates only to their allotment and issue to Placees, or such persons as they nominate as their agents, direct by the Company. Such agreement assumes that the Placing Shares are not being acquired in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to transfer the Placing Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement related to any other dealings in the Placing Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax may be payable. In that event, the Placee agrees that it shall be responsible for such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax and neither the Company nor Zeus shall be responsible for such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. If this is the case, each Placee should seek its own advice and they should notify Zeus accordingly. In addition, Placees should note that they will be liable for any capital duty, stamp duty and all other stamp, issue, securities, transfer, registration, documentary or other duties or taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties relating thereto) payable outside the United Kingdom by them or any other person on the acquisition by them of any Placing Shares or the agreement by them to acquire any Placing Shares, and each Placee, or the Placee's nominee, in respect of whom (or in respect of the person for whom it is participating in the Placing as an agent or nominee) the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of Placing Shares has given rise to such non-United Kingdom stamp, registration, documentary, transfer or similar taxes or duties, undertakes to pay such taxes and duties, including any interest and penalties (if applicable), forthwith and to indemnify on an after-tax basis and to hold harmless the Company and Zeus in the event that any of the Company and/or Zeus have incurred any such liability to such taxes or duties.\nThe representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements, indemnities and undertakings contained in these Terms and Conditions are given to Zeus for itself and on behalf of the Company and are irrevocable.\nZeus is authorised and regulated by the FCA in the United Kingdom and is acting exclusively for the Company and no one else in connection with the Placing, and will not be responsible to anyone (including any Placees) other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to their clients or for providing advice in relation to the Placing or any other matters referred to in these Terms and Conditions.\nEach Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges that Zeus does not owe any fiduciary or other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings, acknowledgements, agreements or indemnities in the Placing Agreement.\nThe provisions of these Terms and Conditions may be varied, waived or modified as regards specific Placees or on a general basis by Zeus provided always that such variation, waiver or modification is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Company or Zeus.\nIn the case of a joint agreement to acquire Placing Shares, references to a \"Placee\" in these Terms and Conditions are to each of such Placees and such joint Placees' liability is joint and several.\nInformation to Distributors\nSolely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended (\"MiFID II\"); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the \"MiFID II Product Governance Requirements\"), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any \"manufacturer\" (for the purposes of the Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Placing Shares have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that the Placing Shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the \"Target Market Assessment\").\nNotwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors should note that: the price of the Company's common shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Company's common shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Company's common shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom.\nThe Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Placing. Furthermore, it is noted that, notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, Zeus will only procure investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Placing Shares.\nEach distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Placing Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.\nGeneral\nEach Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges and agrees that Zeus may (at its absolute discretion) satisfy its obligations to procure Placees by itself agreeing to become a Placee in respect of some or all of the Placing Shares or by nominating any connected or associated person to do so.\nWhen a Placee or any person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with Zeus, any money held in an account with Zeus on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be treated as client money within the meaning of the relevant rules and regulations of the FCA made under the FSMA. Each Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections conferred by the client money rules: as a consequence this money will not be segregated from Zeus's money in accordance with the client money rules and will be held by it under a banking relationship and not as trustee.\nIn these Terms and Conditions, any words following the terms \"including\", \"include\", \"in particular\", \"for example\" or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term preceding those terms.\nReferences to time in the Terms and Conditions are to London time, unless otherwise stated.\nAll times and dates in these Terms and Conditions may be subject to amendment. Placees will be notified of any changes.\nNo statement in the Announcement or these Terms and Conditions is intended to be a profit forecast or estimate, and no statement in the Announcement or these Terms and Conditions should be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of the Company for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per share of the Company.\nThe price of Placing Shares and any income expected from them may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested upon disposal of the Placing Shares. Past performance is no guide to future performance, and persons needing advice should consult an independent financial adviser.\nThe Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing will not be admitted to trading on any stock exchange other than the main market of the London Stock Exchange.\nNeither the content of the Company's website nor any website accessible by hyperlinks on the Company's website is incorporated in, or forms part of, these Terms and Conditions and/or the Announcement.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
